comment,14268990,,,1493933258,,marcosdumay,"Expressiveness is a objective term, although it&#x27;s multidimensional. It&#x27;s the number of different concepts you can express in a language without writing an interpreter¹. Anyway, the dimensionality isn&#x27;t much of a problem on that comparison since Haskell has the upper hand in an overwhelming number of dimensions.<p>Keep in mind that Javascript required a multi-year process in what a committee reached an agreement and all interpreters had to be changed so that JS programmers could use continuation monads. And they are still restricted to continuation, and a way too verbose syntax.<p>&gt; Another meaningless subjective word (sheer).<p>That &quot;The easy is hard, the hard is easy&quot; assessment is inherently subjective, but &quot;subjective&quot; is not the same as &quot;meaningless&quot;, even less when nearly everybody that experienced it has the same assessment. (Are you also going to complain about my &quot;overwhelming&quot; above?)<p>1 - I&#x27;d give you a point on subjectivity if you were talking about the difference between a library and an interpreter. But those languages (that is, JS and Basic) are just not expressive enough for this to become a problem."

comment,14268981,,,1493933188,,hosh,"I work remote at an early-stage startup. My wife recently regained custody of her 12-year-old daughter. Our daughter is on the Autism spectrum, and when combined with emotional issues and an entitlement attitude, this has not only consumed my time, but my wife&#x27;s as well. It&#x27;s a full-time job for two parents.<p>My &quot;side projects&quot; encompasses more than than software programming -- martial arts, meditation, biking, etc. I used to be able to do a lot of things, but I can&#x27;t anymore. My step-daughter comes home around 15:30 and it tends to go on until around 21:30. More if there was a meltdown or some sort of family drama (which, in the past few months have happened frequently, but thankfully, is trending less now). I&#x27;ve had to take over getting her up in the morning -- both my wife and my wife&#x27;s mother have had significant trouble getting her out of bed, showered, dressed and ready for school. Likewise for getting ready for bed.<p>I&#x27;ve had to accept that my life and lifestyle has changed. (I thought I was prepared for it; I wasn&#x27;t). I&#x27;ve had to work through a lot of things myself, including periodic, arising feelings of resentment that is toxic to a child growing up. The meditation helps, but ultimately, I had to accept change and the fact that I am not as in control of my life as I used to be.<p>I had also been working with her a lot on homework -- to stop doing her math and reading like she is mashing buttons while playing a video game. I quickly found that there are even more basic wisdom and skills that my daughter never learned: what it means to be a part of a community; what responsibility means; what respect and speaking respectfully means. We&#x27;ve also been trying to wean her off of the meds and learn how to process her emotions.<p>Over time, I&#x27;ve been coaching her through different things. Our current theme is &quot;organization&quot; -- how to organize her time, how to organize her things, how to check things off a list by herself instead of &quot;mashing buttons&quot; (she has a tendency to try something to quickly satisfy what she perceives as what my wife or I wants instead of thinking things through, or methodically checking through things). The idea is to transfer more and more responsibility for herself to her rather than helicopter parenting and enabling this attitude of &quot;parents are service providers&quot;. It takes time, it&#x27;s bearing fruit, and this process goes at its own pace.<p>And yeah, at the end of the night, I&#x27;m exhausted too.<p>Some five years back, I got into an internet flame-war with someone about this. He was working 60-hour weeks with kids, trapped in his job, and I was talking about side-projects. I was single with a lot of mobility. Joke&#x27;s on me."

Right now, the vast majority of Americans consume enough to survive and more. It&#x27;s an accounting question: who&#x27;s actually paying for the people to survive? Indirectly it&#x27;s the government. This is just manifesting those costs transparently, and also doing some shifting of a substantial number of costs from charity, hospitals, and family to the government. As a society, though, it won&#x27;t increase consumption by enough to exceed our ability to produce the goods and services consumed (&quot;unaffordable&quot;)."

comment,14268924,,,1493932693,,derefr,"&gt; If upstream wants people to stick with the latest and &quot;greatest&quot; then they need to stop breaking APIs and ABIs at the drop of a hat.<p>&quot;Upstream&quot; usually doesn&#x27;t care about that. Upstreams—developers who write things that get packaged—almost always have a philosophy of &quot;eh, just vendor it.&quot; Which is where things like Docker images come from.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s the <i>distros</i> that care about being able to update a package&#x27;s deps out from under it; because this lets them have one copy of e.g. OpenSSL on the system and fix everything that depends on that package, whenever there&#x27;s a new vuln discovered in it, by just updating that package. They&#x27;re the ones trying to eat a cake and have it—even as the upstream devs take the view that you should just eat their ingredients directly and never bother baking a cake in the first place. :)<p>---<p>As a tangent: I&#x27;m almost beginning to agree with the Golang philosophy: a &quot;package&quot; <i>is</i> its ABI. New ABI = new package with a separate identifier, that everyone has to explicitly update to.<p>Doing this has two incentive-system effects:<p>1. It makes package-authors <i>much</i> more reluctant to make breaking changes to their ABIs, which in turn encourages them to think through their ABI before their initial release;<p>2. The semantics of a semver major version are transferred entirely to the package identifier itself. Almost nobody uses semver major-versions correctly; but if you collapse those semantics up a level, the package-manager can enforce the semantics. So you, as a downstream consumer, can actually be <i>sure</i> there are no breaking ABI changes as long as you&#x27;re tracking the same package identifier."

After all as the late and great George Carlin pointed out: &quot;fucking is legal, selling is legal, why isn&#x27;t selling fucking legal???&quot;<p>The reason pornography is legal in the US, is the First Amendment, because the US Supreme Court has always and probably always will be very lax with the requirements for the &quot;speech&quot; part of &quot;free speech&quot; and very strict in imposing the &quot;free&quot; part of the bargain on the government. As such pornography is legal because it is an expression, and it is almost impossible for the government to ban these.<p>Had the founders of the US, when they wrote the Constitution, included the right to free trade I am sure prostitution, and many other things among it, would have enjoyed similar protection.

People have to do something to get an income. Maybe not something economically useful. But something.<p>The entire point of the article is: in a not so far future there won&#x27;t be many jobs left, as automatization has taken them over.<p>Look what once provided many jobs, especially jobs with ultra-low skill requirements: agriculture (nearly entirely replaced by machines, even the tractors drive themselves now), car manufacturing (looooads of jobs vanished there due to robotics, and what&#x27;s left is the stuff where robots are lacking dexterity), mining (been shifted to other countries due to environmental laws and cost issues, as well as mechanized) and metal production (as before, plus automatization).<p>The next huge job providers on the death list are transportation - taxicabs, trucks and even fully-automated rail are already a reality -, callcenters&#x2F;support (due to ML, speech recognition and voice synthesis, plus the rise of customer self service), retail (again, automatization plus self-service, just look at IKEA) and shipping (flying drones!).<p>The only jobs left will be manual work that can not really be done with robots now or in near future: developing software for robots or supervising them, as well as some trade jobs (electricians, plumbers and similar construction jobs).<p>The problem: in a society where human labor is essentially irrelevant in terms of quantity, how will there be consumers for all the stuff that gets produced? Either the 1% will manage, due to using robot police&#x2F;military&#x2F;riot-units, to once again dictate over the masses and be eventually replaced in a revolution, or the world radically rethinks the model of capitalism. And no, socialism is not the perfect answer either - it&#x27;s only a step towards a fully equal society."

comment,14268882,,,1493932382,,FullMtlAlcoholc,"&gt; According to Wikipedia, Valve&#x27;s total equity is $2.5 billion while Activision Blizzard&#x27;s is $8.068 billion.<p>It&#x27;s not just Blizzard. You&#x27;re forgetting about the huge juggernaut that is the Call of Duty franchise.<p>&gt;I think it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to say that WoW and WC3 are similar games. One is an RTS and the other is an MMORPG.<p>Obviously, WoW has an army of creatives making content and developing an immersive world, but WoW is using the Warcraft engine. You can have diverse experiences using the same engine. I was just stating that Blizzard didn&#x27;t begin to branch out until a couple of years ago.<p>&gt;But you know how much money I&#x27;ve spent on Counter Strike over the years? Probably much less than I&#x27;ve spent on Overwatch loot boxes plus the game, and that game only came out last year.<p>Anecdotal data not withstanding, Coutnerstrike still gets roughly 1.7x the viewers on Twitch<p>&gt; As someone who is a 1x MOBA player, I like HOTS. I find the way that experience is combined makes games a little bit more competitive but also less toxic (No all chat helps too :)).<p>Different strokes for different folks I guess. The other major sport with 5 players (basketball) is superstar driven. Teamwork is cool, but I just find spectating a singular talent who turns the tide of a game by him&#x2F;herself more fun and entertaining.<p>&gt; They have a story-mode coop now, Overwatch Origins.<p>And it&#x27;s over!!!!! Grrrr<p>&gt;Yes, I do think they regretted not capturing the value created by Dota.
I don&#x27;t think Blizzard games are perfect, I just think their strategy is obvious.<p>Valve may be smaller, but they seem to have a lot more freedom and a lot more diverse business interests...hardware company, the defacto online pc game store, sometimes game developer<p>&gt;Blizzard is going to approach modding with the same care and caution that Nintendo approaches mobile games.<p>Sigh, don&#x27;t get me started. The Switch was such a massive dissapointment to me. Of course it&#x27;s going to have top quality games, but I find their decision to not include a $5 gps chip a huge missed opportunity. It&#x27;s dissapointing that Nintendo won&#x27;t be the trailblazer for AR, location based, or VR games. MArio  64 and Zelda 64 basically set the standarrd for how to develop 3D games while no one on the PS had figured it out at that point.<p>I could also go on for days about how much of a letdown AR Pokemon became. It captured the attention of the dev community like no other game has. I marvel at what the game could&#x27;ve become if Niantic had allowed this completely self-organizing group of disparate devs to continue hacking away...it could&#x27;ve been a transformative moment that forever changed how games are created and revolutionized the social aspect of it. Sure, the bots were a pain but let&#x27;s be real. The gameplay was absolutely terrible, the UI even worse. I&#x27;ve seen better core gameplay scrapped together in a 24 hour code jam. Single devs made improvements over the base game, and it took them only a couple of days to redo certain features I was praying for Nintendo to step in as consultants after the game spread like wildfire...<p>Then again that could have been disastrous too. Nintendo still has not figured out online multiplayer gaming"

Telling them they can&#x27;t is not freedom.<p>In a perfect environment without any means of coercion it would make sense. Nobody can be forced to release his source code if he wants to distribute binary. Anyone who wants to have source code is free not to use programs and their forks it if the source code is not provided.<p>The problem is that we live in a world with copyright and patent laws which allow someone not only to fork your source code and distribute it in binary form, but also to attach various restrictions to it and make governments impose those restrictions on you by means of force, literally. For example, they can prohibit reverse engineering or add some feature which you can&#x27;t reproduce due to patents, place trademarks all over the place and add copyrighted art in case of games.<p>That is why less permissive licenses may make our world more free, as in reducing coercion. Apache-2.0 prevents patents abuse, but does not restrict new contributors. GPL not only grants patent license, but prevents others from abusing patents and copyright law. Thus, despite forcing attribution and releasing source code, it brings us closer to the perfect coercion-free world."

It also means you can see the wife and kids during coffee breaks. Also, instead of sitting in a canteen for your lunch hour you can spend it with the family. In my case, I&#x27;m lucky enough to live close to the sea so when the weather is good we can spend lunch on the beach.<p>I work on side projects in the evenings, and at the weekends. Having kids has impacted free-time, as it always will. In order to maximise productive time, I gave up video-games  entirely."

comment,14268855,,,1493932157,,jesseb,"I&#x27;ll quickly preface by saying that everybody will experience different effects, so this is merely my experience.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly heavy user, have been for a number of years. I use it primarily to treat depression&#x2F;anxiety&#x2F;insomnia, but I also experience chronic pain due to years of abusing my body (rugby, mountain biking, snowboarding, etc.). Nothing crazy, but something is always hurting.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t compare its effects to traditional painkillers by any means. I would say it makes me less aware of the pain, and &quot;dulls&quot; it. For example I can tell my knee isn&#x27;t happy, but it doesn&#x27;t &quot;hurt&quot;. I have however tried some topical cream from a dispensary containing CBD (most strains you&#x27;ll be smoking have been bred for higher THC and lower CBD), and it&#x27;s incredibly effective. I experienced hours of absolute painlessness (which is unheard of for me).<p>As for workouts, I find it helps tremendously with focus and endurance. It&#x27;s a lot easier to keep pushing on when you would normally give up.<p>I think it&#x27;s a very valuable tool, and has relatively few downsides to it (I won&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s 100% safe&#x2F;healthy).

comment,14268843,,,1493932053,,kemiller2002,"Having kids taught me how to use every spare minute I have.  I&#x27;m a single parent with 2 kids, so I have no back up to take care of them if I am busy with something else.  Half of my free time is spent with my kids, so I have to make everything else count.  My process looks a little chaotic, but I carefully plan out what I&#x27;m going to do, and when I need to do it by.  My entire day is on a mental schedule.  Unless I deliberately want to, I waste very little in &quot;screwing around.&quot;  Everything is mentally prioritized and evaluated.<p>Having kids emphasized what I already learned in the food industry, don&#x27;t do silly extraneous tasks ever, and do things as fast as possible without compromising what I do.  I rarely wait and do one thing at a time when I&#x27;m trying to get stuff done.  For example, I&#x27;m normally cooking one meal and prepping the kids lunch at the same time.<p>Unless I absolutely need a break, I don&#x27;t watch T.V. idly.  It maybe in the background, but I&#x27;m normally only half paying attention. I turn on CC so I can read the text, and half listen.  Watch videos to learn something?  You can read (I&#x27;ve heard 4 times) faster than watching a video, so I almost always take that route.  The one thing I don&#x27;t do is listen to podcasts in the car.  That is reserved for NPR to catch up on world news.<p>Most of the time when people want to meet dealing with business, I demand an agenda, then I decide if it&#x27;s worth it.

A boost of taxation to Denmark levels and dedicating the revenues to a basic income would do it.<p>It&#x27;s not a math or accounting problem, it&#x27;s an economic and political one. No UBI advocate thinks it could be done politically this very moment. But drop labor force participation to below 50 percent, and we&#x27;ve got a very different political and economic situation. Absolutely no one else has even an inkling of how to deal with that hypothetical situation--the best conventional policy thinkers have is &quot;it&#x27;s impossible for that to happen, so we don&#x27;t need to worry about it.&quot; And if it doesn&#x27;t, well, I&#x27;m more than happy to concede that a UBI isn&#x27;t politically possible, or even necessary TBH.<p>If it does, though, a UBI is the best mitigating strategy we have right now, and the impossible can rapidly become the necessary."

Linux was quite simple at that time. I could write my own init, if I wanted. Unfortunately now this knowledge is obsolete. Systemd is a complex beast which uses a lot of arcane techniques, I&#x27;m hardly understanding it. chroot was a really simple concept, but nowadays people use containers, and they are much more complex than chroot. Logging is complicated. In the past I could try to load and then mount partition from livecd or another OS and read logs, now I don&#x27;t know how to do it. Init scripts were simple bash scripts. They were verbose, may be buggy, but after all they were just bash scripts and every Linux user knows bash, so every Linux user could write or modify init script. Now systemd uses its own format, I&#x27;m spending hours every time I need to write new service or timer for RedHat. SELinux is just so complex. I know about UNIX permissions. They are so simple and elegant. I&#x27;m using them everywhere, when I need security. I could explain them in 2 minutes. SELinux has books. I have those books in bookmarks, may be I&#x27;ll read them sometimes. But until then, I just use copy-pasta from internets to solve my tasks, like allow ssh to listen at non-standard port. I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s good, that I have to run some random strings on my computer from root without fully understanding what they are doing. SELinux has binary compiled configurations and some encrypted logs for tools to decipher them, what a mess! Sometimes I just disable it to get things done.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I think that Linux looks more professional, more robust, especially for system administrators, who can devote their lives to learn about those systems. But for hobbyists, who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time, Linux became much less transparent.<p>May be if I didn&#x27;t have that prior knowledge, it would be easier to learn those things from scratch. But I doubt it."

comment,14268660,,,1493930980,,Maro,"I have tried to use Haskell a number of times in the past ~5 years for small-scale projects and witnessed others try to use it, and most of these projects (actually I think all) have resulted in failure &#x2F; rewrites in more simple&#x2F;plain-vanilla languages like Python&#x2F;Go. I keep thinking Haskell is interesting, but at some point I had to force myself to stop investing time in it because I kept concluding it&#x27;s not a good investment of time for a move-fast&#x2F;practical person like me. I again had to remind myself when I read this post.<p>Some reasons I remember for the various failures, in no particular order:<p>- steep learning curve = experienced (in other languages) programmers having a tough time not being productive for weeks&#x2F;months in the new language, with no clear payoff for the kind of projects they&#x27;re working on<p>- sometimes&#x2F;often side-effects&#x2F;states&#x2F;global vars&#x2F;hackyness is what I want, because I&#x27;m experimenting with something in the code; and if I&#x27;m not sure if this code will be around in 3 months, I want to leave the mess in and not refactor it<p>- in general, I think all-the-way pure no side effects is too much; I think J.Carmack said sth along the lines: Haskell has good ideas which should be imported into more generally useful languages like C++&#x2F;etc, eg. the gamestate in an FPS game should be write-once, it makes the engine&#x2F;architecture easier to understand (but in general the language should support side-effect)<p>- I found the type system to be cumbersome: I kept not being able to model things the way I wanted to and running into annoyances; I find classes&#x2F;objects&#x2F;templates etc from the C++&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Python&#x2F;whatever world to be  more useful for modeling applications<p>- when the spec of the system keeps changing (=the norm in lean&#x2F;cont.delivery environments), it&#x27;s cumbersome&#x2F;not practical to keep updating the types and deal with the cascading effects<p>- weird &quot;bugs&quot; due to how the VM evaluates the program (usually around lazyness&#x2F;lists) leading to memory leaks; when I was chasing these issues I always felt like I&#x27;m wasting my time trying to convince the ghc runtime to do X, which would be trivial in an imperative language where I just write the program to do X and I&#x27;m done<p>- cryptic ghc compile errors regarding types (granted, this is similar in C++ with templates and STL..)<p>- if it compiles it&#x27;s good =&gt; fallacy we kept running into<p>- type system seemed not a good fit for certain common use-cases, like parsing dynamic&#x2F;messy things like json<p>Working at Facebook for the last year and seeing the PHP&#x2F;Hack codebase which powers this incredibly successful product&#x2F;company has further eroded my interest in Haskell: Facebook&#x27;s slow transition from PHP to Hack (=win) shows that some level of strictness&#x2F;typing&#x2F;etc is important, but it&#x27;s pointless to overdo the purity. Just pick sth which is good enough, make sure it has outstanding all-around tooling, have good code-review, and then focus on the product you&#x27;re building, not the language.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Haskell is shit, I just don&#x27;t care about it anymore. I&#x27;m happy if people get good use out of it, clearly there are problem spaces that are compact, well-defined and correctness is super-important (like parsing)."

comment,14268645,,,1493930877,,Danihan,"Not entirely mine, but a good summary of why basic income is likely to remain a pipe dream:<p>$12k is the cited number that you see a lot in basic income discussions. That&#x27;s just over the poverty level. That&#x27;s not enough to live on and it&#x27;s practically a bonus for some members of this site. It&#x27;s not enough to do anything with. Even with that, people would still work massive hours to obtain the best house on the block.<p>But just to do that in the US you are talking about 3 trillion dollars (300 million x $10k for easy math) that you have to find in the budget. Now basic income advocates will say you can make up some if not most of that by cutting welfare programs, but given the nature of welfare programs - good luck. That stipend is also not enough to pay for healthcare, so you can&#x27;t cut that.<p>How exactly do you convince a nation which already isn&#x27;t willing to pay for healthcare to pay for basic income, too?<p>I&#x27;d love to be wrong, but I&#x27;ve never seen any numbers that are workable, especially in a political climate anything like today. There could be a complete paradigm shift in the future, where machines literally take care of all needs in an automated way, but that&#x27;s such a strange reality that welfare is honestly about the last problem we&#x27;d need to discuss."

They also make a nice conversation piece.<p>They do have a distinctive smell, though, especially once they are budding.

comment,14268459,,,1493929504,,Danihan,"&gt;Cue the cries for UBI.<p>$12k is the cited number that you see a lot in basic income discussions. That&#x27;s just over the poverty level. That&#x27;s not enough to live on and it&#x27;s practically a bonus for some members of this site. It&#x27;s not enough to do anything with. Even with that, people would still work massive hours to obtain the best house on the block.<p>But just to do that in the US you are talking about 3 trillion dollars (300 million x $10k for easy math) that you have to find in the budget. Now basic income advocates will say you can make up some if not most of that by cutting welfare programs, but given the nature of welfare programs - good luck. That stipend is also not enough to pay for healthcare, so you can&#x27;t cut that.<p>How exactly do you convince a nation which already isn&#x27;t willing to pay for healthcare to pay for basic income, too?<p>I&#x27;d love to be wrong, but I&#x27;ve never seen any numbers that are workable, especially in a political climate anything like today. There could be a complete paradigm shift in the future, where machines literally take care of all needs in an automated way, but that&#x27;s such a strange reality that welfare is honestly about the last problem we&#x27;d need to discuss."

comment,14268378,,,1493928991,,elihu,"Haskell is good for problems where you want to spend most of your time thinking in terms of the problem domain and not so much about all the little implementation details.<p>For instance, if you were to write a CAD program, you probable want to be spending your time thinking about algebra and geometry, and not about little details like how an array is laid out in memory or when memory needs to be freed.  The latter might be important for optimizing the last bit of performance out of a tight loop, but a lot of problems are hard enough on their own that just coming up with any solution that works is enough trouble on its own.<p>It&#x27;s also good for problems where you want pretty good performance but don&#x27;t have to be as fast as C, or where you want to take advantage of multi-core parallelism but don&#x27;t want to deal with the usual complexities of threaded code.<p>Persistent data structures are really nice for certain kinds of applications, such as web services, where you have some complex internal state that needs to be updated periodically.  Error handling is really easy when you can just bail out when something fails, since none of the state was ever modified-in-place and your old pointer to the old state is still valid.<p>The powerful static type checker makes Haskell a good fit for applications where it&#x27;s really important that you calculate the right answer, or where you don&#x27;t want to spend much time tracking down weird bugs.<p>Haskell isn&#x27;t so good at applications where you need hard real-time guarantees or you want to have very fine control over the memory layout of your data structures or you want to be able to easily predict CPU or memory usage."

This nonsense that JIT is slow is an old belief that&#x27;s hung around because it sounds nice. The fact is that the numbers don&#x27;t line up [0].<p>&gt; Rust is a nice language, but all of its numerical computing is experimental 0.x stuff. You&#x27;ll probably end up wrapping another library to do your number crunching. It&#x27;s probably written in Fortran<p>It&#x27;s new and it&#x27;s growing. It&#x27;s also a single example for a single case.<p>But it even still have a comprehensive numeric library [1].<p>&gt; C++ has pointer aliasing shenanigans, so it&#x27;s hard to make it as efficient as Fortran<p>I don&#x27;t know how this could be the case (especially with the addition of shared pointer) but you shouldn&#x27;t be writing code with huge shared memory dependencies. Use constexpr, use inline, and use functions. There&#x27;s no need for 20 functions to have shared memory access to a piece of data (which I have seen scientists do).<p>&gt; I have seen a couple of projects that tried to port Fortran libraries to C++. They came out slower, buggier, and less readable.<p>That is on the programmers who wrote it, not the language&#x27;s fault. There&#x27;s no magical reason that Fortran should be faster then other programming languages. That&#x27;s like me saying &quot;Some of my friends tried to design a new car engine. Their car came out slower and buggier then my Ford Model T which still runs perfectly&quot;. It&#x27;s anecdotal evidence that doesn&#x27;t say anything about C++.<p>&gt; The only reason you&#x27;d want to do that is a specific hatred for Fortran -- which you are not the only one to have<p>I don&#x27;t have a hatred for Fortran. I just don&#x27;t see any job where I&#x27;d prefer using Fortran over a more-sane alternative. Fortran was great for 77 but isn&#x27;t great for 17.<p>&gt; over the decades it hasn&#x27;t proven to be a good motivation for redesigning software.<p>Comparability with modern software, improved performance from modern language features, pool of developers, further abstraction of your implementation to remove cruft from the code base using modern language features, and easier deployment are the reasons why we shouldn&#x27;t be using Fortran.<p>I mean... when people use Fortran they usually don&#x27;t even make use of Fortran 90&#x27;s abstraction features. It&#x27;s insane.<p>&gt; Of course people like to use Python, but you don&#x27;t get to use Python instead of Fortran. That would be incredibly slow. You use Python and Fortran. For example, you use NumPy and SciPy, which make Python a great high-level platform for numerical computing because they wrap large amounts of Fortran code.<p>You are mistaken. NumPy does not contain Fortran in it&#x27;s code base. SciPy does but it only makes up 25% of the SciPy code base. I have no doubt that within the next 20-50 years that will slowly be removed bit by bit.<p>Wrapping a legacy library is the first step to replacing it. Once you remove the hard dependancy you will remove<p>&gt; If you use Python for numerical computing, you are not &quot;moving away from Fortran&quot;, you&#x27;re embracing its success.<p>No you are definitely moving away from Fortran and towards better tools. The old cruft may still be there but as time moves it will slowly be replaced. You&#x27;d never need to use Fortran to get Fortran style speeds with modern software architecture using just python and C [2].

comment,14268285,,,1493928432,,moftz,"A lot of bars in my college town are starting to require two forms of ID before they let you in. One must be a driver&#x27;s license but the other can be your student ID card or a credit card. I&#x27;m sure it would be easy to fake our student ID cards but for the most part, this rule works well. Some bars are known for letting in minors. Their bouncers are inexperienced or just don&#x27;t care. Every now and then those bars get a fine and they put someone experienced out front and give them a UV flashlight. That guy will collect enough fake IDs until the bar isn&#x27;t making enough money so they will bring the first bouncers out and rake in more money from the underaged patrons until they get another fine.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people get let in using the worst fake IDs I&#x27;ve ever seen and I&#x27;ve seen people rejected using real IDs. It all depends on the bouncer&#x27;s experience and how much the bar owner cares about not letting in underaged people."

comment,14268210,,,1493928034,,mands,"We&#x27;re using Haskell to produce an entire compute platform for building, composing, and running type-safe containerised micro-services for data science. This certainly touches on a lot of the areas that Haskell is traditionally known for being good at, e.g. building DSLs, type systems, interpreters, etc.<p>However, the work also includes a runtime platform that is more low-level, including building our own container system, talking to the Linux kernel, using cgroups&#x2F;resource management, and distributed message passing - areas where languages such as Go have found a niche, and may be classified as <i>Real World</i>.
However for us, Haskell&#x27;s type-safety, runtime performance, and extensive ecosystem has been a boon even in this domain. We effectively use it as an (incredibly powerful) general-purpose language here, and it&#x27;s worked more than fine.<p>We&#x27;re currently at around 15,000 lines of code with a team of 5 Haskellers, and it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem regarding performance, understanding the codebase, or with newcomers to the team.<p><i>(plug - we&#x27;re at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;nstack&#x2F;nstack"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;nstack&#x2F;nstack</a> and are hiring more Haskellers)</i>"

comment,14267973,,,1493926484,,Tarean,"Reflex is a frontend library for haskell.<p><pre><code>    -- create an input text widget with auto clean on return and return an event firing on return
    -- containing the string before clean
    inputW :: MonadWidget t m =&gt; m (Event t T.Text)
    inputW = do
        rec
          -- fire send event when pressing enter
          let send = textInputGetEnter input

          -- textInput with content reset on send

         -- tag the send signal with the inputText value BEFORE resetting 
        return $ tag (current $ input ^. textInput_value) send


</code></pre>
Ignoring the operator soup for a second (thanks lens) you might notice that the send event depends on the input field and the content of the input field depends on the send event. In, say, java you would first create the field and then mutate it separately. In haskell mutating wouldn&#x27;t work so instead we usually tie the knot which means making the value dependent on itself and letting laziness figure it out.<p>However we are creating a text field here so if we make the value recursive on itself we are gonna be spawning text fields all over the place. MonadFix is variant of this that splices the effect out so it is only run once and then allows the value to be recursive."

comment,14267865,,,1493925760,,qb45,"&gt; I think you completely fail to realize that Fortran does have wide adoption, and that there is a big market for commercial and open-source Fortran compilers, and that these optimizations have already been made.<p>100 times this. Few years ago I personally edited Makefiles in one HPC project to test GCC and clang as possible replacements for PGI. Lemme tell you this: they were joke. Like, 2x slower.<p>First of all, commercial Fortran compilers can do all the simple optimizations like inlining, loop unrolling etc. And then on top of that, they come with loads of HPC-specific optimizations like autovectorization, loop tiling, loop fusion and hell knows what else. GCC recently seems to be developing in this direction, maybe they&#x27;ll become competitive at some point or maybe already are, clang was behind GCC last time checked.<p>In any case, state of the art Fortran compilers are good. And guess what, GCC has a Fortran frontend too. No need to speculate, you can go and test GCC on your codebase now.<p>In fact, most modern high performance compilers, open source or commercial, have multiple frontends for multiple languages, usually including C and Fortran."

comment,14267850,,,1493925671,,splintercell,"&gt; none of the Altcoins currently have any use outside speculation,<p>I feel like this is moving goal posts. Take for instance Litecoin has a market not because it is used by various businesses but because it provides faster clearance to bitcoin exchanges (due to faster transaction times). Sure exchanges are dealing on a lower security network but they&#x27;re ok taking that risk because the value they derive from it (i.e. more profits) is higher than the insurance it would cost them if something were to go wrong.<p>Similarly, people use Monero because it provides them with the much needed privacy features. They may anchor back in bitcoin to purchase goods, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the reason why Monero is valued isn&#x27;t &quot;pure speculation&quot;.<p>Ethereum is currently being valued like a startup, it&#x27;s product are expected to be very much useful in the future. Almost none of these products really care about Ethers being used to buy and sell goods on Craigslist or on Tigerdirect for computers. Take for instance Golem.<p>You&#x27;re claiming that only real valuation of good is if it is being used to exchange for real goods or else it is pure speculation, BECAUSE bitcoin has a clear advantage in that field. It&#x27;s like Dash saying &quot;No cryptocurrency is as good as Dash because all cryptocurrencies have long names, and only Dash has a short name, so it will be easier to adopt because the name can hang on easily on to your tongue.&quot;."

comment,14267823,,,1493925466,,aseipp,"I&#x27;ve been writing Haskell for nearly 10 years and am coming up on 4 years writing it full time. (You could say I know the language pretty well...)<p>I think it&#x27;s just a pretty good general purpose language, for the most part? I know that&#x27;s not very exciting of an answer, but I do consulting for people and I&#x27;ve seen Haskell for everything our clients do, from web development (a lot of web development), compiler development, distributed OLAP style analytic processing on large data volumes, custom languages&#x2F;DSLs, machine learning, hardware&#x2F;FPGA design work, desktop software (flight tracking&#x2F;schedule software, used by on-ground airport personnel, with some incredibly beautiful code), cryptocurrency and cryptography etc etc. There are the occasional research-y things, and we&#x27;ve also just done things like that for random institutions or companies (e.g. prototyping RINA-style non-TCP network designs.)<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say any of these were a particular &quot;sweet spot&quot;. Though some things like compiler development or web development are pretty pleasurable. The language and libraries make those pretty good. Web development is one of the more popular things now especially. Everyone has to have their thing in a browser now, and there&#x27;s a fair amount of library code for this stuff now. Definitely one of the stronger things.<p>You do get the occasional problem that just has this perfectly elegant solution at the core and that&#x27;s always an awesome bonus. One of my favorites was the aforementioned flight software. It had this very strict set of bureaucratic guidelines but all the core logic ended up having a very nice, pure formulation that ended up being about 8 functions used in a single function-composition pipeline. (We use this sometimes as an example in our training of real solutions for real problems.) A lot of software is much more boring and traditional.<p>Mostly, it works well and stays out of my way, and lets me solve problems for good. And I really like the language in general compared to most other languages; it hits a very unique sweet spot that most others don&#x27;t try to touch.<p>I do admit the sort of high level, abstract shenanigans are fun and interesting too, but I think of it more as a fun side thing. Just this week I literally wrote the documentation for a data type, describing it as an &quot;Arbitrary-rank Hypercuboid, parameterized over its dimension.&quot; Luckily I do not think you will ever have to use that code in reality, so you can breath easy. :)<p>---<p>EDIT: and to be fair, there are definitely some problems. Vis-a-vis my joke, we could all collectively use better &quot;soft&quot; documentation. I think some problems like &quot;operator overload extravaganza&quot; are overblown due to unfamiliarity. Most real codebases aren&#x27;t operator soup; but bigger problems are things like &quot;When to use the right abstraction&quot; are real problems we have hard times explaining.<p>I don&#x27;t think performance is much harder than most other languages, but we definitely don&#x27;t have tools that are as nice in some ways, nor tools that are as diverse. The compiler is also slow compared to e.g. OCaml. Some parts of the ecosystem are a lot worse than others; e.g. easy-to-use native GUI bindings are still a bit open. Windows is a bit less nice to use than Unixen.<p>There&#x27;s a big gap between training in-person vs online&#x2F;self taught content too, IME."

He is attempting to down a tree by focusing snipping roots individually instead of just pushing the rotting trunk over.<p>Penrose&#x27;s argument is hollow. We understand the biophysics behind how the brain works. They aren&#x27;t complicated at the level of detail you need to understand how the system works. We understand how neurons interact with each other. The evidence is consistent not only with our well settled understanding of chemical and biological systems, but also increasingly consistent with our development of information systems at scale.<p>The real gap is whether or not the totality of &#x27;consciousness&#x27; is really just neural interactions at scale + starting state data, but the more we learn, the more that mystery vanishes. We understand the low-level perceptor-&gt;analysis models much better now, and we can map perceptor inputs at scale to outcomes in model tuning. In short, the consciousness of the gaps is rapidly losing his hiding spots.<p>Penrose&#x27;s argument is taken seriously because we have collectively created a tremendous philosophical and institutional infrastructure around the idea of free will and the theory he attacks strongly implies there is some level of determinism in our cognitive systems. Since he is irreproachable on a personal or intellectual peerage level, he is a fantastic champion of this counter-cultural perspective.<p>However, if we apply even the barest of epistemological tools to the issue, we rapidly recognize that even if Penrose is correct, the chance of his position being accurate is so remote and so unverifiable so as to be useless.<p>But the existence of a counter-argument against the deterministic mind itself, absent of its validity, is itself useful. It allows us to collectively hem and haw before changing our views and institutions to fit our understanding of how people work. Which means Penrose&#x27;s argument is not going away anytime soon."

As my comment has pointed out the reasons mentioned above are incorrect. Modern C++ compilers, Rust, and Julia all have the edge on Fortran in their use case.<p>Also, people are now moving away from Fortran. There&#x27;s a huge push in my field to use python and many students (like me) are&#x27;t using Fortran."

I wonder if there&#x27;s something special about HOW this stimulates the vagus nerve or if it&#x27;s any stimulation at all.

comment,14267679,,,1493924324,,marcosdumay,"Haskell has a preference for looking academic, and is one of the favorites on academic circles. But that does not mean it&#x27;s not used within industry.<p>I&#x27;d say that people mostly do not know what is running in industry. It could be any share of anything. We get a hint looking at job offers; Haskell is small there, but not unheard of.<p>On the sweet spot, Haskell is great for modeling complex domains; it&#x27;s great for long-lived mostly maintenance stuff, since refactoring is so easy; it tends to generate very reliable and reasonably fast (faster than Java&#x2F;.Net) executables, but hinders complete correctness proofs and has some grave speed issues that can ruin your day if you hit them.<p>I would like to know how is it to manage a team of Haskell developers. I do expect it to be better than Java&#x2F;.Net in forcing safe interfaces between developers (thus making it reasonably easy to survive a bad developer in a team), but I never saw it in practice."

comment,14267673,,,1493924310,,wayn3,"But we are talking about literal programming here. Not conceptual programming.<p>I dont think that an AI will program itself anything like we program computers.<p>People who &quot;program&quot; themselves really just provide good data. Positive reinforcement, &quot;healthy thoughts&quot;, &quot;gaining valuable reference experiences&quot;, things like that. When you want to learn a new language, at the simplest level, you can immerse yourself in that countries culture and you will learn automatically. You don&#x27;t hop inside your brain and move the axons around. You just provide good data and let the engine do its job, and why would an AI be incapable of doing that?<p>They already do that. &quot;Backprop&quot; is that mechanism. Not yet on a really advanced level, but a machine learning algorithm already introduces its learning back into itself and incrementally improves on that."

Primarily to help me lose a few pounds, but also in response to all of the recent publicized studies about how fasting and calorie restriction may have other overall health benefits.<p>Usually on my 500 calorie days I&#x27;ll just drink a couple Boosts. I&#x27;d like to consider Soylent as an option for the fasting days as well, but from a cost perspective it can&#x27;t really compete with the other alternatives out there (Boost, Ensure, and various no-name store brands available from places like Sam&#x27;s Club and Costco). Liquid Soylent runs between $2.69-$3.09&#x2F;400kcal, whereas high protein Boost (which is not even the cheapest option if you&#x27;re willing to go with no-name brands) runs at $1.93&#x2F;400kcal. Going with Soylent Powder can bring your costs down more in line at $1.54&#x2F;400kcal, but the added hassle of having to mix it yourself doesn&#x27;t make this a very attractive option in comparison.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m ultimately getting at is, assuming you are just using Soylent to supplement an otherwise normal diet, I don&#x27;t understand its appeal over other less expensive nutritional meal supplements like Boost and Ensure."

I met Mr. Ray (senior) a few times, and I remember him as a wonderfully gentle man, who took the time to talk to a six year old me as if I was an adult. He didn&#x27;t talk down to me, he sat and told me stories.<p>I didn&#x27;t know then that he was such a famous man. I just knew him as the sweet man who told great stories - and he did tell great stories! He also asked me about my life (my six-year-old life), and genuinely listened to everything I said. He was just a great guy.<p>One of my prize possessions is a sketch he did for me - he saw me reading a comic book (Tintin - The Secret of the Unicorn), and asked me to name my favorite character. I pointed to a panel showing Snowy (Tintin&#x27;s dog) running. He whipped out his pad, and sketched that panel for me. I remember watching with amazement as Snowy came to life!<p>I still have that sketch, carefully framed. I wish I had been older and gotten to know him better, but I&#x27;m glad I met him.

comment,14267400,,,1493922526,,qb45,"&gt; There&#x27;s also this notion that &quot;Fortran is fast&quot; that MANY people hold for some reason. They don&#x27;t know about what kinds of modern compiler optimizations they&#x27;re missing out on and what new IPC frameworks are available.<p>Fortran is fast and has no reason to be worse than C. In fact, it may be easier to write compiler-friendly code in F thanks to &quot;restrict by default&quot;. And are there really HPC-grade C compilers with whatever &quot;modern optimizations&quot; that don&#x27;t come with a Fortran frontend? Don&#x27;t think so.<p>BTW, I have seen an attempt to rewrite a few dozen KLOC Fortran project to C and it wasn&#x27;t pretty. The code was still a bunch of for loops crunching through a bunch of arrays, just in a different language, and then it had some new bugs that were introduced in translation and also it produced slightly different results because of different language rules, compiler and optimizations translating the same math formulas to different machine code. And the formulas were written to produce expected output when compiled with, you guessed it, Fortran.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the old-school Fortran with 3-letter variable names, 72 character columns, GOTOs and stuff sucks donkey balls. But you don&#x27;t have to write like that - while I&#x27;m no real Fortran expert (sorry), I&#x27;ve heard that modern standards of Fortran are vastly better and look much closer to C. I would certainly research this before rewriting everything in C."

You just tend to end up with leaky abstractions (which break the laws found in this math disdained so much) and hard to maintain code (technical debt).  It might be worth the trade off some times but we do waste a lot of time on this.  Probably more than it would take to learn these concepts.

But that&#x27;s irrelevant because what matters is the actual nutritional​ composition of these products.<p>Soylent has 20g of protein per serving, and most of the products listed above are also in that 15-30g of protein range and share most of the same micronutrients, so functionally they&#x27;re about equivalent. The only real differences between all these products are marketing, price, taste, &quot;recommended&quot; serving sizes, and small tweaks in nutrient ratios.

I&#x27;ll try and do a halfway decent job here.<p>&gt; I would love if an expert could expand on the relationship between mixed effects and Empirical Bayes.<p>A real expert?  Here you go:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;statweb.stanford.edu&#x2F;~ckirby&#x2F;brad&#x2F;LSI&#x2F;monograph_CUP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;statweb.stanford.edu&#x2F;~ckirby&#x2F;brad&#x2F;LSI&#x2F;monograph_CUP.p...</a><p>Read it, all of it, but particularly chapter 1, section 2.5, and chapters 8, 10, and 11.  Why does testing, effect size estimation, and high-dimensional analysis have anything to do with anything?  Because...<p>1) independence is largely a myth 
2) you are likely to have multiple ratings per reviewer on your site, whether your generating distribution is nearly-continuous (0-10, mean-centered) or discrete (0&#x2F;1, A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C). If you discard this, you are throwing away an enormous amount of information, and failing utterly to understand why a person would estimate not just the variance but the covariance <i>even for a univariate response</i>.<p>The second point is the one that matters.<p>Also, &quot;empirical Bayes&quot; is in modern parlance equivalent to &quot;Bayes&quot;.  What&#x27;s the alternative?  &quot;Conjectural Bayes&quot;?  (Maybe I should quit while I&#x27;m ahead, pure frequentists may be lurking somewhere)<p>&gt; I welcome your feedback though on how I could make this point clearer.<p>For starters, edit.  Your post is too damned long.<p>Think about where you are getting diminishing returns and why.  Is there ever a realistic situation where your ratings site would not keep track of who submitted the rating?  (It&#x27;s certainly not going to be an unbiased sample, if so; the ballot box will get stuffed)  So if you have to keep track of who&#x27;s voting, you automatically have information to decompose the covariance matrix, and everything else logically follows.<p>A univariate response with a multivariate predictor (say, rating ~ movie*rater) can have multiple sources of variance, and estimating these from small samples is hard.  When you use a James-Stein estimator, you trade variance for bias.  You&#x27;re shrinking towards movie-specific variance estimates, but you almost certainly have enough information to shrink towards movie-centric and rater-centric estimates of fixed and random effects, tempered by the number of ratings per movie and the number of ratings per rater.  (Obviously you should not have more than one rating per movie per rater, else your sample cannot be unbiased).<p>I think you will return to this and write a much crisper, more concise, and more useful summary once this sinks in.   I could be wrong.  But you&#x27;ll have learned something deeply useful even if I am.  I do not think you can lose by it."
comment,14267064,,,1493920356,,DougWebb,"Protectionism only works when two things are true:
  - Other countries can&#x27;t produce the product better than your country can
  - Other countries can&#x27;t sell the product to markets besides yours<p>If we were to enact a tariff on foreign-made smartphones that was so high that they couldn&#x27;t compete with domestically-made smartphones, the smartphone manufacturers in China and the rest of the far east would just sell their phones across the rest of the world, where they would out-compete our phones on price (initially). Our domestic manufacturers would have a smaller market and less access to materials and technical advancements, causing our phones to become inferior in quality as well as overpriced. And that would eventually hurt our people and our entire economy as well, because we won&#x27;t be able to enjoy the technological advancements and lower-cost goods that the rest of the world is benefiting from.<p>The Soviet Union used to have a pretty self-contained, very protectionist economy, and the low-quality of their goods was a standing joke in the US for decades. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what protectionism gets you if you&#x27;re not the sole manufacturer or sole market for a product."

This is a good example of why you (or I) shouldn&#x27;t try and invent security measures; leave it to professionals.<p>Second, the regular passwords had already been compromised on these accounts. Presumably, at the time they phished the regular password, they could have phished the special 2FA password as well.

Don&#x27;t use the GPL&#x27;d code.  The author of the GPL&#x27;d work has chosen unwaivering freedom for the user over all else.  You are free to write your own implementation.  Why should that developer have to allow you to use her code in proprietary software?<p>Speaking personally: I&#x27;m a free software activist.  I write my code in the hope that it will be useful to others, but under the condition that it always remain free&#x2F;libre.  I would rather my software never be used at all than be incorporated into a proprietary program.  In certain cases, depending on the community (e.g. Web), I recognize that my choice might certainly mean that nobody will use the software.  If I choose the LGPL for something to permit its use in proprietary software, then it&#x27;s a strategic choice.[0]  I currently have no LGPL&#x27;d projects.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-not-lgpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-not-lgpl.html</a>"

comment,14266917,,,1493919529,,wayn3,"As I said, I do not consider capitalism a &quot;thing&quot;. Free Markets generate winners and losers. In nature, in economies, in many different expressions of physical reality. &quot;Capitalism&quot;, Marx&#x27; big piece, obfuscates that and tries to reason that there is some oppressive force, exhibited by a ruling class, over the peasantry. I am, by the way, only using that &quot;demeaning&quot; term because its the one Marx used. He said &quot;Bauern&quot;, which translates directly to &quot;peasants&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not contesting that feudal lords were a thing. Certainly not in the middle ages. To what extent that was still the case around 1890 - I&#x27;m not sure. I wasn&#x27;t around back then. I don&#x27;t think feudalism is a thing in the present, at least not in central europe.<p>If you want to study this whole class system, Nietzsche does a lot better job of explaining is and is way less pathetic about it. &quot;Morals as a concept are installed by rulers to keep their sheep in check, deal with it&quot;.<p>- Marxism and Communism may be closer to each other than anarchism and communism, but they are not the same thing. Marx called for a peasant uprising. He&#x27;s just pissed about the fact that the value created by peasants ends up in the hands of their owners.<p>- There is no autocratic rule in the free world. France elected a &quot;capitalist&quot; in sarkozy because they were pissed with financials. Then they elected a socialist in whoever the current guy is. Now theyre pissed with financials. Next, they are electing either the lunatic Le Pen who claimed that ebola bombs should be dropped on romania because it would give them both valuable scientific data and eliminate a bunch of people that the world doesnt need.<p>- Germany is ruled by the two big parties for a long time now because they are so close to each other in ideas and anyone who deviates from the mainstream is called a nazi or an evil capitalist or some other hate inspiring nonsense that you can only vote for her.<p>- The US was very fucking sure about the fact that they would elect the wall streets darling. Everyone knew it. People didnt even cast their vote because obviously the orange one would not win. Now he did. And people seem to forget that that guy was elected. Hes a fucking moron with the potential for Hitler stardom, but people elected that guy. That was not wall street. That was people who voted for change. Now they dont get change and they get fucked over because the guy is in it for the money but they certainly got whom they voted for.<p>-You&#x27;re right, it had the feudalist mode of production for that time. With the advent of the USSR, it had the state-capitalist mode of production. On what basis do I declare this? On the basis of Marx&#x27;s definition of the capitalist mode of production.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter what you declare this. I know that its not communism. Its never communism. But at what point do people accept that every time a country tried communism, everything went to shit? It clearly doesnt work. I mean it works for no one. No one achieves anything worthwhile in communism experiments. Not a single person. But a whole lot of them end up in gulags.<p>And I&#x27;m not saying that communism is bad. But the results that came out of communism are so spectacularly bad, EVERY SINGLE TIME, that trying again is unethical. People think that Hitler was a bad person, but Mao achieved thrice the kill count without even trying.<p>&gt; What issues are you talking about, in particular? I think the requirement to sell one&#x27;s labour to a class of property owners is a rather big issue.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the fact that Russia is ruled by a person that was formerly part of the KGB and really wants his big soviet union back - and backs it up by moves like blatantly annexing parts of other countries whenever possible. The baltic states are shitting their pants a lot, these days.<p>I don&#x27;t feel particularly exploited, btw. We live in a very free world. If you don&#x27;t want to sell your time, just don&#x27;t do it. Start your own company. See how that goes. We are all capable of taking chances. Some win, some lose. Some don&#x27;t even try. Somehow, those who are too weak, or preoccupied with other things, are blaming those who did try, for the fact that they have relatively easy lives.<p>I&#x27;m often confronted with the fact that I was &quot;lucky&quot; and only get to have such thoughts because I was lucky. The thing is, I was lucky. I was born in central europe. Thats already jackpot worthy. We constitute way less than 10% of the worlds population and live like gods by default. The worst of the worst hobo in germany is way better off than almost anyone in bangladesh.<p>And I was probably a lot luckier than that. Other circumstances.<p>But we are all really fucking lucky that in the past, some entrepreneurs were fed up with the fact that there was no running water and that water was always infested with mud and bacteria and doctors didnt think it was cool that 5 out of 7 babies died of the common cold. And they solved those problems. And became rich. If there had never been an option to become rich in the first place, how many of those guys would have pulled a Picasso instead and just painted? If you take away just 10% of the useful inventions made by people who only got ambitious because money, where would we be today instead?<p>If you can make the argument that the rich benefit from the peasants getting redistributed funds, you should also be capable to make the argument that the worst of the worst peasant today lives like a god, compared to the richest of the rich just 100 years ago. And thats not hyperbole. Travel back 100 years and tell the still reigning king of Germany just about the bottom tier technologies we have access to. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d consider that blasphemy."

comment,14266746,,,1493918499,,vidarh,"&gt; Despite the fact that I was only consuming 2000 calories, 500 less than recommended for my size&#x2F;weight&#x2F;age&#x2F;sex, I managed to gain weight.<p>2500kcal is only suitable for people living a very active lifestyle or exercising a lot. Note that going to the gym for 45minutes 3 times a week is not being active.<p>When I spent an hour lifting heavy weights 5 times a week, my weight was stable at around 2500kcal.<p>The reality is that unless you work as a construction worker or other type of job that keep you active most of the day and&#x2F;or exercise a <i>lot</i> (my 5x a week were heavy compound powerlifting lifts), chances are you need to adjust those recommendations down substantially.<p>Ultimatly the only thing you can do is to gradually lower your intake until you&#x27;re losing weight. That you were adding weight at 2000kcal is not that surprising.<p>I&#x27;ve not tried Soylent, but I&#x27;ve trued Huel, and compared to what you described it seems a lot more pleasant, and more importantly, if anything I&#x27;ve found it hard to eat enough on it because it fills me up so much. The biggest problem for me in using it as much as I&#x27;d <i>like</i> is that filling me up doesn&#x27;t stop me craving food - it&#x27;s a reward thing for me."
comment,14266743,,,1493918486,,kwhitefoot,The headline makes it sound as if abusing SS7 was all they needed to do but in fact they had to have the other factor as well so it really is not quite as scary as it at first appears.  It also seems from the article that the thieves were able to log in to the accounts with just a password and only needed the SMS to sign transactions.<p>It&#x27;s different here in Norway; the banks require two factor authentication to log in as well as signing transactions.<p>I don&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s perfect but at least no one can log in unless they control both factors.

Better coders outside of the US, UK, EUR, etc.<p>One of my clients is one of the largest multinational corp. in the world. They&#x27;re excellent at getting things done, above average at remote work, and obviously have offices around the world. Their primary industry has a drastically changing demographic in the US which is prompting a hiring wave of younger people. They would love nothing more than to hire most of them outside of the US. The schools in several countries in Asia outperform the US in the necessary areas of study and they speak fine English. I&#x27;m not talking about India. My client is working very hard to make this a reality. They will eventually pull it off. These jobs are all very good paying white collar jobs. I&#x27;m telling you the middle class in the US hasn&#x27;t seen the beginning of the devastation they are about to endure.<p>This is a trend that will continue until all labor is (as) equal (as an imperfect market will allow) no matter the geography.

And both have asked me for extra hours at crunch times, but at a startup they <i>know</i> they are asking a lot, and there&#x27;s a chance for abstract future rewards as a result. When I&#x27;ve had mandatory unpaid extra hours at a big corp, I got a couple of slices of &quot;free&quot; pizza (and I got to not be fired).<p>In recent years I&#x27;ve worked for small established businesses&#x2F;non-profits, and I enjoy the happy medium."

Maybe you can do the literal cooking in 1 hour. In order to be able to do that, how much time do you need to spend shopping for ingredients and transporting them, making sure they&#x27;re still fresh and haven&#x27;t gone bad, washing dishes and otherwise cleaning, and getting enough experience in cooking that you can actually do everything that fast.<p>And once you do all that, you have a week&#x27;s worth of eating the same thing for every meal you do this for, and reheated and not as fresh as when you just made it. This is starting to sound not that much better than Soylent.<p>It&#x27;s like that great Ars article on why many people don&#x27;t cook. Maybe you or I can also install Linux and build an app from source. Could your grandmother do that, or would she be so hopelessly lost as to not even know where to start? That&#x27;s what the idea of cooking is like for a lot of people. You aren&#x27;t helping those people by insisting that it&#x27;s possible to cook a week&#x27;s worth of food in an hour, if you&#x27;re already an experienced cook and know what ingredients to get, where to get them from, how long they stay good for, what to do if you can&#x27;t find the ones you wanted, how to actually make everything in the most efficient way.

comment,14266569,,,1493917493,,bitcoinstudent,"Neither of those things are completely true. While bitcoin is accepted at some merchants, volume is pretty low. Several have removed it. People don&#x27;t really use it to buy things, precisely because the network is stagnating and congested. The vast majority of Bitcoin&#x27;s value derives from speculation, just like Ethereum.<p>Also, Monero is also on equal terms with Bitcoin when it comes to dark net markets. Another crypto with an actual valuable distinguishing feature (true anonymity) has more of a use case than Bitcoin here."

comment,14266497,,,1493917111,,ng12,"What I mean when I say &quot;bad stats&quot; is that the article is drawing conclusions based on a particular view of a data set which probably does not accurately reflect reality for a laundry list of reasons.<p>As an example, I&#x27;m sure of you&#x27;re heard of the 77-79 cent wage gap. I&#x27;d call that bad stats -- what the study was actually comparing was the average income of the entire male US population and the entire female population. When you correct for job title the gap is actually closer to 95 cents on the dollar -- and you&#x27;re still not correcting for other factors, such as the fact that men work more hours than women and tend to be more aggressive negotiators. But people read the study, took the data on face value, and now the wage gap is a cultural meme we can&#x27;t get rid of.<p>I think the same thing applies here -- a slice of the data looks funny so people cry sexism. I wouldn&#x27;t at all be surprised if the difference goes away if you adjust for level, experience, technology used, product, background, etc, etc, etc. Publishing stats like that is dangerous unless you also release the data set and the method you used to derive your stats."

comment,14266485,,,1493917022,,dmix,"&gt; American labor was fucked anyways, Globalism only accelerated trends that would have happened anyhow<p>This is an important and underrated idea that so often gets lost thanks to politics. Much like the drug war, people think that market trends and phenomenons can be controlled somehow, that they are simply choices that people make, and those choices can be controlled - people can simply just choose not to make that choice or face consequences from the state. Rather than a whole new paradigm, something that generates real value that taps into a raw supply&#x2F;demand, even if it means taking big risks, and that will exist whether or not we ignore it. This is how many ineffective government policies get made.<p>America needs to embrace globalism as an unhappy reality. The problem is that they have been operating for two decades as if it didn&#x27;t come with a big downside - that globalism is this great new thing that will make everyone richer. Trump and Bernie have been feeding off this ignored reality without addressing the real consequence. Rather globalism being sold as something that is all good, it should have been sold as a tough new evolution of the marketplace, much like a recession correcting an imbalanced investment bubble. It doesn&#x27;t need to be rejected by an outsider  strongman politician but embraced by an outsider who is willing to face the reality that the consequences extend well beyond the influential class in Washington and they aren&#x27;t all good.<p>You can&#x27;t force your way back to the old reality as if the market phenomenon didn&#x27;t exist, but you can minimize the downside as you transition to the new reality and do what you can to stay on top of it.<p>Sadly, hard medicine and politics don&#x27;t go together. Even if it&#x27;s the best (and only) medicine.<p>To continue the drug war analogy, the goal should be minimizing the harms of peoples addictions rather than trying to pretend the addictions won&#x27;t happen. Likewise the economy needs to either a) compete with the globe in manufacturing and&#x2F;or b) develop new industries.<p>I&#x27;m not as convinced as many people are that a) is not possible, Apple clearly thinks there&#x27;s plenty of potential there and so do I. But I&#x27;m quite confident that that US is failing to do b) properly. In my business class they called it a new &quot;service-based economy&quot; but clearly that has been insufficient to keep employment and wages high. To develop new industries in place of manufacturing they need to rekindle entrepreneurship and small businesses to give life to new industries. I get the impression the US government is obsessed with appeasing existing BigCos (just look at TPP or Obama&#x27;s policies during the financial crisis) rather than developing the next generation of industry that functions well in a global marketplace. Silicon Valley is a big piece of the puzzle, but even then it&#x27;s treated as a sideshow in Washington (even more so now, which is a big fault of Trump) but in the same vein it can&#x27;t be the only one moving forward.<p>I really hope Trump&#x27;s liberal tax and regulatory policy helps boost b). The risk of course is that the usual Washington backroom dealings by legacy BigCos and special interests will guide policy even further towards tired old ideas (like making Wall St even more money) over helping develop new business. At a minimum we know that Trump is motivated to help with a)... so that&#x27;s something.<p>(I purposefully ignored social policy consequences here as this comment is getting long enough)"

comment,14266479,,,1493916995,,maxerickson,"I&#x27;ve never argued that estate recovery doesn&#x27;t happen. Maybe you could admit that the 3&#x2F;4 of people on Medicaid that aren&#x27;t elderly aren&#x27;t subject to it in any way, the primary thing that has lead me to pushing back on your comments. It&#x27;s a pretty big deal that it doesn&#x27;t apply, because that&#x27;s where you started, fear mongering about how evil Medicaid is for <i>everyone</i>.<p>And I think I was clear enough in my previous comment. It&#x27;s fine if the resources for elder care come from the assets of the people receiving the care. Dealing with it through estate recovery is a detail; the other way to do it would be to force disposal of the assets before providing any benefit (pretty much the situation faced today by people who don&#x27;t own homes).<p>I think a different health care system could cost a lot less and be better for everyone.

comment,14266455,,,1493916850,,eis,"It&#x27;s sad but I have to agree.

I&#x27;m sure they are losing customers left and right. Mobile phones (especially Android) are incredibly insecure. Why not use these little token generators like in the past?<p>Another bank of mine can&#x27;t issue proper bank reference letters anymore which are required in many cases to open other accounts or form a company. The same bank also stopped the Visa support of their debit cards so they are practically useless apart from using at the ATM.<p>Another bank with a business account can&#x27;t issue credit cards anymore. For many transfers they require tons of verification and paperwork, opening a new account gets harder and harder. I have to fill out a stupid W-8ben form even though I have nothing to do with the US.

You would be amazed how many people dont know what a sandwich menu is, if you vary from the &quot;standard&quot; you lose tons of people right off the bat. Also clients are very scared to try anything new simply because they tend to have a &quot;not broke, dont fix it&quot; mentality.<p>I do a lot of training type interfaces for large companies and I literally try to compress everything down to a 1 button solution. You put 2 buttons marked start and stop and someone will be befuddled right off the bat. Sounds like exaggeration but its not, If anyone has to click a menu to find something you will lose people because they will wonder where something is at and not click. I try to have everything on screen in an &quot;order&quot; and as little as possible. Anything &quot;extra&quot; and people get distracted etc.<p>Making UI at this point is like making hammers, try to innovate&#x2F;design a new hammer.<p>I agree with much of your statement because I see lots of room for improvement, so wasnt trying to come off argumentative. I simply find its usually not just the designer but also who you are designing for that is the limitation."

For the most part, Ensure targets baby boomers, Slimfast targets gen-xers or people who want to lose weight, and Soylent targets millenials&#x2F;professionals. Again, nothing wrong with it (so long as you don&#x27;t act like Soylent is some revolutionary&#x2F;brave-new-world product)."

If people in a field define themself over superficial stuff like that, are they qualified to judge the quality of their work?

comment,14266212,,,1493915493,,ex3xu,"I&#x27;d theorize that this has something to do with the fact that the hippocampus is implicated in both determining locational context (for navigation) as well as task management and executive function. I&#x27;ve read a bunch of books on the topic of willpower that indicate that decision-making is a fairly expensive on a metabolic level, so this makes sense to me -- it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re minimizing the array of actions from which your hippocampus has to scan when it determines what to work on from locational context."
comment,14266209,,,1493915468,,davycro,"For medical training, Soylent has been wonderful. On emergency shifts I often won&#x27;t have 10 or 20 minutes to go to the cafeteria for a meal as there are too many acute patients. I used to rely on energy bars to get me through but I much prefer Soylent. They are quicker to eat and I know that I am drinking a someone balanced meal. I usually drink about three in an eight hour shift.<p>You raise a great point about self reflection and Soylent. To stop cooking entirely is madness, and Soylent can enable antisocial tendencies or depression. They shouldn&#x27;t brand themselves as a complete dietary replacement for food."

comment,14266203,,,1493915444,,splintercell,"&gt;  There have been a lot of talk about code replacing lawyers for years now, I still see very little of that actually happening.<p>Replacing X, when X is a task performed by a human is not an easy task for any technology.<p>Take for instance Automobiles replaced Horse Cab drivers, but it created Automobile drivers. So have cars really replaced the drivers? In a way they have, and in a way they haven&#x27;t.<p>Today Smart contracts are being used to performed mostly financial transactions. Our main problem remains the same what it was in front of the Internet in early days. They wanted their refrigerator to be able to automatically order milk once it runs out of it, but it turned out that IoT wasn&#x27;t even a thing then.<p>On the other hand, replacing telegrams and faxes with email was a lot easier task. Doing things which have no pre-internet equivalence (for instance camming) were a lot more easily integrated.<p>Same here, the main and the easiest use of Smart Contracts would be in the fields where there is no current usage exists. Currently Smart contracts are being used for some lightweight usages for instance performing trades of cryptocurrencies. Today ENS is launched where they are using Smart Contracts to implement domain registry systems. Tomorrow maybe decentralized uber would be made possible. None of these tasks are really &#x27;replace a lawyer&#x27; tasks."

It is not only about how much calorie&#x2F;protein one is consuming, there are also some useful by-products which helps in overall functioning of the body as well. A very simple analogy is only drinking fruit juice

The protocol is merely interested in the validity of a block, not how to achieve this conclusion.<p>If you wrote a client that simply accepted all blocks as valid, it would accept this hardfork without problem, sans not having a correct balance record anymore.<p>What it would not accept is one of the newer hardforks because those actually changed the protocol and EVM to some extend, making it not understandable to old clients.

comment,14266116,,,1493915001,,ChuckMcM,"I certainly agree with the article&#x27;s premise, that Apple has put essentially a cap on what you can earn. I don&#x27;t know that this devalues software as much as people copying does however.<p>Consider a couple of scenarios; in scenario 1 when someone publishes an App that is the only App of its kind available in the store. There are millions of phone&#x2F;tablet users and you capture some some percentage of them and you make a few million dollars[1]. Scenario 2 is someone publishes an App in the App store, and it starts to sell well, then 15 additional people publish the exact same App in the App store and are so busy undercutting each other the price has gone down to 99 cents. But lets say this group of apps still sells reasonably well, then another 1500 people put out the same App on the store they all sell for 99 cents or are free with in game purchases. The original app creator made perhaps a few thousand dollars on the sale of the app. And all the people jumping on board made anywhere from nothing to a few thousand as well.<p>This isn&#x27;t the first time that technology has released the creative spark in thousands more people, and as a result the market was flooded with new products that were vaguely similar. The industrial revolution had a similar effect it seems. As it became possible for more and more people to build things in a small factory or with less training and apprenticeship things got a bit out of hand and the thing that saved them was that if you patented your invention you could be assured (if you defended your invention against infringers) of a small monopoly to recoup your costs.<p>And if you had that sort of system today, you could invest all your time and effort and build your app and patent it and then not have to worry that hundreds of ripoff lookalikes of varying quality would dilute the market and the returns.<p>And yet it would be pretty silly to have a 20 year monopoly on an App that made fart sounds, but perhaps something more aligned with technology time frames like 5 years or 3 years.<p>The fundamental challenge is that it is always easier to &#x27;reproduce&#x27; than to &#x27;invent.&#x27; And if you cannot reward the inventors they won&#x27;t be able to survive and we&#x27;ll miss out on innovation that they might otherwise have been able to provide.<p>[1] Don&#x27;t worry I don&#x27;t think this is <i>reality</i> :-)"

Stocking a bunker, for instance. Or for coping when under low energy (depression, as mentioned elsewhere), or in a critical crunch.

I agree that Soylent is overhyped as a quick-fix to diet and nutrition problems that have complex causes, e.g. depression, social isolation, obesity, etc. But, since we aren&#x27;t going to resolve those causes any time soon, it&#x27;s probably better, on balance, to have Soylent available as a reasonably healthy option for people."
comment,14266032,,,1493914574,,devgutt,"For me, the reason is different. I don&#x27;t mind people walking or even talking nearby, but I really hate the process of pack&#x2F;unpack. Before work, I need to setup the laptop, the cables, the IP to access my local server from Android, get notebooks, pens, ohh my earphones, and a lot more, only then I can jump to work for maybe 2-3 hours (I feel a little uneasy to stay longer in the cafe). If you are working alone, the bathroom is more complicated. Oh and the outlet. And internet... It doesn&#x27;t work for me. Office is my only option, because I want everything ready to start immediately."

comment,14266023,,,1493914543,,err4nt,"I&#x27;ll offer a little counterpoint to that. I had known &#x27;free software&#x27; as shareware until ~2001 when I had my first introduction to Linux. I was very curious, and took to open source software AND the ideals very easily.<p>Because of my experience as a teenager poking around operating systems, fixing xorg.conf files after compiling nVidia drivers, and running and using thousands of different software applications - tools for many many different jobs I had never been exposed to before. I consider open-source being an education I received that has helped me to use computers and software today.<p>Because I have benefitted so much from open-source, now that I&#x27;m in a position where I can write and release software I am very motivated to give back to the same community that first gave to me. I hope that by producing work and releasing it to open-source I can help build up those who follow in my footsteps - and that&#x27;s a richer treasure than dollars in my pocket.<p>Having said all of this, I can&#x27;t choose GPL for giving away my own software because the viral nature of it feels like a chain letter. It leaves a really bad taste in your mouth and I wouldn&#x27;t want anybody to feel compelled to pick between using something I&#x27;m TRYING to give away for free and having to GPL their project, or not be able to use something I&#x27;m trying to give away for free just because of the license. So I keep choosing MIT, which basically says: &#x27;you have to acknowledge that I wrote it, and you can&#x27;t sue me because of damages you got from using it&#x27; but leaves pretty much any other use (even commercial reselling) open.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine anybody looking at a piece of code under MIT and having objections, or a reason why the license prevents them from using it - and THAT is the point of free software to me. GPL software is arguably LESS free than the more liberal licenses :D"
comment,14266020,,,1493914522,,joeyo,"The promise of the &quot;electroceutical&quot; approach is localized neurotransmitter release: you want to enact increased ACh in the body (and localized within the body, if possible) but not in the CNS, where it would likely result in undesired side effects.<p>You see the same phenomena in reverse with drugs intended for the brain (e.g. for treating depression). The severe side effects of those drugs are because the same neurotransmitter receptors involved in mood in the brain are involved in digestion in the gut."
comment,14266017,,,1493914514,,smichel17,"&gt; I feel we&#x27;ve lost ourselves in the freedom of users and forgotten about the people that make the applications for the users.<p>First off, thank you for acknowledging that permissive vs copyleft licenses is a trade-off between developer and user freedom. So many people claim that one is strictly less restrictive than the other, and that&#x27;s simply not the case. So, which style of license you should choose is a question of who needs the freedom more.<p>In my opinion, users have very little control in the current state of computing, so I am inclined to release as much of my work under the (a)GPL as possible. I think that&#x27;s worth a little developer frustration.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out, that this is a moral issue more than a practical one. It applies equally to my stance on things like limiting the power of law enforcement."

I used to be a FastMail customer but a couple minor outages and weirdness around billing made me switch a few years ago. Functional &quot;report spam&quot; is a big win for GoogleMail, and as an apps (or is it &quot;GSuite&quot; now?) customer you don&#x27;t have to worry about ads&#x2F;privacy issues. Don&#x27;t self-host, I self-hosted (Postfix&#x2F;Dovecot) before using FastMail and it was a huge headache between reasonable spam filtering on the receiving end, and undelivered&#x2F;spam-marked emails on the send side, although I learned a lot by self-hosting. Also, it was hard to pretend I was serious about privacy&#x2F;security when I was self-hosting on a box that any Linode admin could shell into as root, especially after Linode&#x27;s security dramas. This is not to say that self-hosting cannot be cheaper and more secure than alternatives, but if you&#x27;re not a full-time sysadmin regularly setting up mail hosts, you probably will get something(s) wrong. I never could silence that voice in the back of my head saying &quot;what if some really important email couldn&#x27;t be delivered to&#x2F;from me?&quot;, which was sometimes right. As others have said, you have to use GPG if you&#x27;re serious about privacy, regardless of your email provider. Anyway, for me, $50&#x2F;year is a great deal for reliable email with good spam filtering, and being able to use my personal address&#x2F;domain for Google Hangouts and Docs is a decent win for collaboration."

As a notorious procrastinator I find the cafe setting very helpful for avoiding the obvious distractions like Wikipedia holes, etc. I&#x27;m sure it sounds stupid to people who are more naturally focused but just the feeling that strangers _could_ be judging my use of time is pretty effective (I know I do it...I may not know why you brought your Macbook to this coffee shop but I&#x27;m pretty damn sure it wasn&#x27;t to read rumours about Kim Kardashian). What I do find hard is thinking through difficult architectural problems in such a setting...often I&#x27;ll spend an hour in the park with pen and paper thinking about that stuff and then hammer it out at the coffee shop. Different strokes I guess."

There&#x27;s loads of people who apply for jobs that have absolutely no experience. Lies, half-truths, etc. This happens in all fields.

I&#x27;ve come to realize that it&#x27;s really difficult to find great stories on a daily basis so thought what if people could share any story they found on the web (from anywhere!) and have this content in one place, then instead of organizations deciding what we see, the community gets to decide that.

comment,14265420,,,1493911024,,jamestanderson,"Well, a large part of what makes up Soylent is soy protein isolate. So there&#x27;s that."
comment,14265417,,,1493911013,,johnfn,"If you go to what they&#x27;ve written up on their website, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amplemeal.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;ample"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amplemeal.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;ample</a>, you can see they&#x27;ve taken and written about a lot of care in selecting ingredients.<p>Off the top of my head, probiotics are a big thing that you don&#x27;t see in Soylent. Spirulina is included. Omega 3 fatty acids. The emphasis on whole foods rather than nutrients is another thing important to me.<p>From what they&#x27;ve written it is clear they are taking a significant focus on nutrition, as the expense of, er, expense. This is a trade off I am willing to make.<p>I don&#x27;t want to spend my days pouring over the latest nutrition research to see what I should be eating. Before Ample I would spend a lot of time chasing the latest research, yet continually feeling like there were huge things I was missing. It gives me great peace of mind to see that apparently smart people are doing this work in my stead. This is a huge advantage I cannnot overstate."
comment,14265414,,,1493911007,,Karunamon,"You don&#x27;t quite understand what the deal with Soylent is.<p>You couldn&#x27;t live on SlimFast if you had to. It&#x27;s an appetite suppressant&#x2F;meal replacement for short term use, given that it&#x27;s not nutritionally balanced.<p>Neither is it similar to Ensure or most other meal replacement drinks for the same reasons. They&#x27;re usually absolutely loaded with fast, low-index sugars that&#x27;ll spike your blood sugar.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s the food equivalent of water. Neutral, nutritious, has what your body needs and nothing more. The carb source they&#x27;re using is high-GI, meaning it won&#x27;t cause that spike. The idea being that when you CBA&#x27;d to cook, when you&#x27;d normally run to the local burger joint&#x27;s drivethru, you shake up a glass of this stuff, and you&#x27;re back to doing whatever you&#x27;re doing for cheaper (about $3 a meal) and in less time.<p>Basically, it hits all of the right notes that most of the on-the-shelf competitors do not. It&#x27;s relatively cheap, it keeps a long time, it&#x27;s actually good for you, it&#x27;s convenient as food could ever possibly be.<p>I personally love the stuff."

Ok.<p>But I think this is true for products that are somewhat orthogonal to their base product and not in direct competition, like a radically new innovative full-blown social network could be.<p>What if mine was such a ground breaking idea?<p>What if, at stage 1 of funding, FB takes over the idea and improves with the same resources that I would only have at &quot;stage 100&quot; funding?<p>Oh and guys, please, I am just reasoning by making hypothesis, no need to remember me how hard is to build such a thing. :)"
comment,14265375,,,1493910692,,golergka,"The biggest fallacy in the post as well as in the comment is that there&#x27;s some &quot;true&quot;, &quot;fair&quot; value of software, and we can just work it out with clever arguments.<p>There isn&#x27;t. Developer and consumer have conflicting interests as far as price of the software go, and the price is set at a point where these interests meet. Of course, there are other variables (such as software developer being able to pay the bills) and parties (such as Apple) at play, but ultimately, this is, as always, just a matter of conflicting interests and resources that both sides have to influence the outcome. All discussions about what is &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;right&quot; in this situation have literally no meaning."

Making something in VR doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it better. You have to make a good game&#x2F;app in the first place. And then there&#x27;s an additional cost for VR. Now you have one more element to screw up.<p>Look, even a regular standard PC could be 10x more useful  if all the software is better built and run flawlessly. Instead we ended up with half-baked glitchy mess. Making a good VR app won&#x27;t be easier than this. The profit break even point will be higher because people have a higher expectation.

It can happen every now and then when I&#x27;m rushing around, and soylent blows away whatever I&#x27;d eat before (nothing, some Mexican I bought in the Mission, clif bars, etc).<p>I&#x27;ve actually switched over to a product called Ample which is similar to Soylent but a bit more health conscious with ingredient choice.

comment,14265333,,,1493910391,,wcummings,You&#x27;re overlooking a big reason for the using the GPL I think: GPL projects are more attractive to certain communities of contributors. People are more willing to invest (potentially a lot of) their time in an open source project if they don&#x27;t feel they&#x27;re being taken advantage of. A lot of people don&#x27;t feel great writing code <i>for free</i> if it&#x27;s going to be relicensed and incorporated into a commercial product.

If you brag about your success and break-the-rules-strategy, people like you less and get more angry with you.

comment,14265273,,,1493909949,,davrosthedalek,"Not an expert, but here is my take:
A phased array consists of many individual, non-directional antennas. The directionality comes by cleverly combining the signal of the antennas. 
If there is a jamming signal, all antennas would receive it. In theory, it would then cancel out when the signals are combined. The question is now: Before the signal is combined, is there any element which can be saturated by the large jamming signal? If so, you can jam.
The phased array direction is tune-able, so I assume the combination is done in the digital domain. That means ADC in between, which can be saturated. So my guess is: yes."

The majority of their concentration is on market psychology, shifting trends in technology enabling new designs to be possible, and the really hard problems of global design.  They tend to have out there hobbies focused around building things and their work process is not a endless flow of whitespace and pretty objects.<p>All this to say -- I am disappointed that the design community has gotten sucked into designing itself more than designing for others -- a process I know is a lot messier than this website shows."

comment,14265183,,,1493909106,,sayurichick,"regarding #1, Core isn&#x27;t incompetent; This is currently the exact situation they want to hold (preventing a hard fork and block size limit increase).<p>They have nefariously manipulated media communications for years to fool people into only accepting a soft fork because they&#x27;ve convinced people a soft fork is somehow safer and any hard fork is automatically contentious. As long as a hard fork is never initiated, they retain write access to the github repo and therefore maintain control of the &quot;default&quot; Bitcoin client. And as  long as Greg Maxwell is in charge, he can continue to receive funding for his startup (blockstream).<p>But yea, crippling layer 1 intentionally and misleading people for their own benefit is incredibly fucked up."

The cultures should only be <i>compatible</i> - not necessarily rooted in similar things. Japanese zen-buddhist shame culture is not rooted in similar things as America&#x27;s typical protestant Christian guilt culture. To my knowledge Japanese immigrants did (and still do) integrate well.<p>Humans are ridiculously adaptable, I would argue the reverse of your argument - that there is no culture on earth that precludes any immigrant from flourishing in  modern, secular western countries.

I think women are drawn just fine to STEM <i>as a whole</i> (if by &quot;drawn&quot; you mean &quot;innate interest&quot;), I think they&#x27;re somewhat structurally discouraged by socially-constructed barriers to STEM as whole and, importantly, quite a bit more discouraged to software engineering in particular.

The reality is a lender might loan to 100,000 people and they know some of those loans are going to fail. If they had a process to only lend to people who would never default, well, impossible.<p>The interest rates you&#x27;re being charged aren&#x27;t tailored specifically to you. But they look at everyone else with similar income and credit and look a the default rate and figure out what they need to charge to make a profit.<p>It&#x27;s the sum of the whole lending business, not individual loans, that matter. They&#x27;ll do as much as they can to mitigate the loss on loans that do default. It&#x27;s just throwing money away not to. But they&#x27;ve got it all figured out to loan money, have some of it default, and still make plenty of profit. The idea that the minority of people who do default and declare bankruptcy causes them any pain is really quaint and naive.<p>But boy is that an image their PR would love to get everyone to buy into. If you can convince people to feel bad. If you can convince society as a whole to shame and pressure people into doing something that&#x27;s the most advantageous for lenders, that is just a lending vision of utopia.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve never been in serious debt or declared bankruptcy.

comment,14264775,,,1493905735,,whack,"To play devil&#x27;s advocate, there are plenty of businesses where companies sell loss-leaders in order to bring in customers, who then spend lucrative amounts of money on other things. Black Friday deals are one example. Mexican restaurants offering free salsa and chips is another.<p>On a larger scheme though, I agree that companies selling things at below-cost, can lead to anti-competitive outcomes that bankrupt any competitors without deep pockets. Uber&#x27;s subsidized rides are an example of this. The WTO has rules against this when it comes to international trade. Perhaps it&#x27;s time we adopted similar laws domestically as well."

comment,14264730,,,1493905391,,dekhn,"The ability to predict the locations of celestial objects to high accuracy is one of the pinnacles of modern science.  The approach, called &quot;ephemeris&quot;, is pretty straightforward- the entire solar system, with all of its components, is modelled using straightforward physics and math (Newton&#x27;s law, with some relativistic corrections).  We can accurately predict the location of all major celestial objects to hundreds of years in the future (barring some unknown external influence).<p>Every single time we send probes to other planets and they collect more data (such as the non-spherical shape of a planet or moon), that data is incorporated into the ephemeris calculations and they become that much more accurate.<p>Now, were a rare, unpredictable event to occur- say, a rogue star entering the solar system with low albedo so we couldn&#x27;t see it coming- that would introduce a change in the dynamics of the system that we couldn&#x27;t easily predict.  it;s not exactly a &quot;black swan&quot; (to use taleb&#x27;s nomenclature) because we know rogue stars exist.<p>The predictions aren&#x27;t perfectly accurate.  We don&#x27;t have total knowledge of every element in the solar system (tiny asteroids affect the motion of the sun, in a very long term way) so the predictions eventually fall off in accuracy.<p>It&#x27;s still a long term discussion whether the solar system is a truly chaotic system, but we&#x27;ll leave that to JPL and Minsky."

Going ahead with the acquisition after an incompetent examination <i>is</i> illegal.<p>More generally, the law recognizes the concepts of negligence, reckless endangerment, a &quot;reasonable person,&quot; the idea that you&#x27;re responsible if you &quot;knew or should have known&quot; about some problem, etc., all of which I would classify as specific ways of stupidity and incompetence being illegal.

comment,14264562,,,1493903838,,skrebbel,"I did some OData a few years ago when it was hip &amp; trendy in .NET land. Right when Facebook announced GraphQL I got a deja vu - our problem with OData was that while the query syntax was awesome, making a server endpoint for it was <i>super</i> hard (unless you happened to be 100% entity framework and wanted all REST data to CRUD straight into the DB and back - which is of course never the case).<p>I now see people on HN have very similar complaints about GraphQL - how its power and flexibility makes making a performant and secure GraphQL backend significantly harder than making an oldschool REST API backend.<p>We ended up regex-parsing the OData query fragments that our app happened to use and made it work. We felt dirty for months after, though.<p>Does anyone have experience with both? Is GraphQL any better than OData in server-side implementability?"

The company who developed it expects to sell about 100 million pills a year. The pills cost $0.01 to produce.<p>Sell the pills for $0.02 and for the first 10 years add a $20&#x2F;pill &#x27;development cost recuperation&#x27; charge, list it on the bill as such. The company gets a 200% R.O.I. on initial development, plus a 200% R.O.I on every pill sold.<p>Few people have problems with a company recovering their costs and making a decent profit. The problems start when the costs have been made back ten times over and they are still keeping the price high using the initial development costs as an excuse.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that companies should adjust their business model to align with how people perceive the world, instead of trying to rewrite millions of years of evolution to fit their business model.<p>Why are services like Netflix and Spotify so popular ? Not because people suddenly changed their mind about paying for IP. Netflix and Spotify sell a <i>service</i>, and people accept that services cost money."

This was much to the chagrin of anti-Semitic &quot;titans of industry&quot;  like Ford and Disney, who are absurdly still held up as paragons of American culture.<p>The dynamism of American society exists precisely to the extent that we don&#x27;t let unthinking appeals to the validity of the status quo guide our behavior."
comment,14264415,,,1493902423,,dbingham,"&gt; ...as long as the market is more or less zero-sum game, one always go in hand with the other.<p>This statement derives from pure propaganda.  It has almost never played out that way in history.  What almost always actually happens is that once a business gets large enough, it has the power to force all of its competitors into bankruptcy or buy them out and then it gets monopoly power.  Once it has monopoly power, anything goes.<p>There are so many examples of this just in American history up until Teddy Roosevelt busted the trusts.  Even after that, there are a ton of examples of businesses being allowed to get way too close before the government got around to breaking them up.<p>If you want to see the clearest example what happens in an entirely unregulated free market -- look at the internet.  The internet has, thus far, been almost entirely unregulated and it has the lowest barrier to entry of almost any business ever.  It takes almost no capital to start an internet startup -- just the knowledge and some free time.  And yet, Google has near monopoly power over search.  Facebook has near monopoly power over social media.  Amazon is nearing monopoly power over internet retail.  In each case, they haven&#x27;t wielded their enormous power in the marketplace, largely for fear of public backlash leading to regulation.  If there was no threat of regulation, you could sure bet they would."

If you do an analysis using promotion level to predict code rejection, you may not see any evidence of bias in this scenario, no matter how severe it actually is.

comment,14264379,,,1493901921,,iplaw,"A lot of people do, actually, and your estimate of the cost associated with bringing a drug to market is off by an order of magnitude.<p>The true cost of bringing a drug to market - inclusive of the extensive research and development required, the failed candidates, the FDA testing and approval processes, etc. - is around $2,800,000,000.<p>And so, as the saying goes, the first pill costs $2.8B, the second pill costs $0.01. &quot;People&quot; only consider the $0.01 cost to produce the pills that they desire to take, and seem to easily ignore that initial $2.8B investment. This is why patent protection is so critical to the success of many industries, especially medical devices and pharmaceuticals.<p>This also explains why drug companies refuse to develop life-saving drugs if the potential market for the drug is too small. In many cases, they would have to charge $1,000,000+ per treatment to break even. There are several medications on the market which, for the full course of treatment, cost around $300,000. This seems to be the upper limit in drug development, and insurance is willing to pay the price because one successful treatment will likely save them 10x that amount in the elimination of future care.<p>This is a recent (3&#x2F;2&#x2F;2017) article [1] on one such $300,000&#x2F;year enzyme-based treatment for a rare disease which affects an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide! Development of drugs for rare diseases has been a major problem for quite a while, with legislation on the matter dating back to 1983. However, it&#x27;s apparent that it&#x27;s still a problem.<p>And here is another article on yet another $300,000 treatment (see, there&#x27;s that number again) to treat cystic fibrosis.<p>[1]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;pompe-drug-lauded-by-trump-costs-300000-a-year.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;pompe-drug-lauded-by-trump-co...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;pharmalot&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;19&#x2F;sarepta-duchenne-drug-prices&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;pharmalot&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;19&#x2F;sarepta-duchen...</a>"

I was eager to buy the new version but the new&#x2F;updated reviews for the old ones were ruthless. One app had to give the new version for free. The other had to promise to keep updating the old version too. The first team just gave up on both apps. The second team (one developer actually) continued but slowly toned down his efforts, going into essentially maintenance mode."

So while you will get unlimited range with our LTE based Sky Drone FPV system, controlling a DJI Phantom is not possible. Any other drone with open serial telemetry port will work though - like all the PX4&#x2F;APM based drones."

I passed through the gift shop inside Empire Sate Building in NY yesterday and 98% of the gifts are asian imported plastic trinkets branded with Empire State and USA logos. Contrasts that to when I visited the museums in Berlin where the shops mainly focused on selling locally produced crafts.

Better still is to forego on television altogether but if you insist on having canned &#x27;entertainment&#x27; (panem et circensis) beamed into your domicile make sure to use as dumb a device as possible.

It&#x27;s hard to deploy such LCD&#x2F;LED sign (you require power and lots of it to be visible in sunlight) but it&#x27;s possible.<p>The important thing here is that this first production outdoor deployment of EPD signs in the world works for for years without any serious problems which confirms that e-paper is a viable technology for outdoor deployments. There was a lot of skepticism back in 2013 if this is at all possible.

comment,14264265,,,1493900677,,Aaargh20318,"I&#x27;d argue that the perceived value of software is correct. As with all IP, once created the value of a <i>copy</i> is pretty much zero. It&#x27;s a simple case of supply and demand, the supply is infinite so logically the price is zero.<p>The problem is not selling software (or songs, or movies or any other IP really) for too little, the problem is billing for something that is not scarce. People intuitively understand that scarce things have value and that the value depends on how scarce it is. This is why selling things for which there is an unlimited supply is an uphill battle.<p>Look at it like this: if you hire a plumber to install a toilet in your home, would you accept it if the toilet was &#x27;free&#x27; but you had to pay a fee for every usage ? Hell no. But you&#x27;ll gladly pay the plumbers hourly wage and material costs.<p>The IP industry is trying to sell toilets on a pay-per-flush basis and then acts all surprised when people don&#x27;t accept this and see no ethical problems with piracy.<p>The real solution would be to find a way to charge for things that people <i>do</i> consider scarce, such as the developers&#x2F;artists time. Unless we find a way to do that we are stuck with this conflict between consumers and producers of IP."

Well, we have one now, there&#x27;s this guy that has been travelling there every week for the past two or three months to fix all the problems, but he&#x27;s not being able to handle it all by himself.

Thanks.<p>What the old Leica of old did was the famous &#x27;F8 and be there&#x27; -- basically at F8 with a mirrorless rangefinder there was enough DoF to shoot pretty much anything, at anytime (apart from pitch black) and still come out with a printable picture...
Even a modern DSLR doesn&#x27;t give you that, as the autofocus will take a bit of time, unless you disable it. Same with the u4&#x2F;3 and other mirrorless.<p>I preferred digital carry-on is a Panasonic DMC-GM1 with a fixed 14mm lens. It&#x27;s bigger than a mobile phone, but it&#x27;s also considerably better, and the battery last weeks, not hours.<p>I also still shoot my 1947 leica IIIc, and the old leica M2, just because I love handling them!<p>The funny bit is that I can shoot <i>anything</i> and <i>anyone</i> <i>anywhere</i> with my old 35mm rangefinder, and people will look at you and smile at you even.

Going into hiding for 7 years so far, at a time when Bitcoin wasn&#x27;t worth much, hoping that in time it will grow in value.<p>But tell me how to cash out any of those bitcoins that are supposed to be Satoshis without crashing the price? Just because it&#x27;s on the blockchain doesn&#x27;t mean anything as that only shows that those coins have changed ownership. They haven&#x27;t been converted to fiat at that time.<p>Being able to sell on exchanges usually takes a few confirmations and by then, enough people will have heard the news of the coins moving and the price will already have plummeted significantly. Sure, those old coins would still be worth something but the actual monetary gain would be much less and Bitcoin itself might not survive such an event.<p>You could of course trade those coins over the counter, just sell the private keys or another method of an off-chain transaction but that still leaves the issue on how to cash out eventually?"

Just thought I&#x27;d point out how bizarre it is that Litecoin even has a price at all when the software is functionally similar to Dogecoin. It&#x27;s only real claim to fame is that it copy-pasted the code earlier than most other cryptocurrencies and hence now survives as a zombie currency backed by the souls of all the bag-holders foolish enough to invest in it (much like how Yahoo continues to survive to this day.)<p>Can we all just agree that Litecoin is a way over-hyped and silly excuse for a cryptocurrency? Silver to Bitcoin&#x27;s gold? I can&#x27;t think of a single problem that Litecoin actually solves compared to ... well, anything. At best: you could say its a speculative instrument tied to the cancerous block size debate. But other than that - is good marketing really worth the price of $21 USD a coin?

The second is the fact that strong encryption remains available. This means you need to outlaw strong encryption, at which point steganography comes up to hide the encryption.
Finally, key-escrow is a massive increase of the attack surface of encryption. It&#x27;s almost as if the government mandates we all use TSA locks on our doors."

There is a certain irony that now it&#x27;s possible to do optimisations like that in javascript - a dynamically typed language with almost no compile time guarantees.<p>Meanwhile java used to have easy static analysis as a design goal (and I think a lot of boilerplate is due to that goal) but the community relies so much on reflection, unsafe access, dynamic bytecode generation, bytecode <i>parsing</i> etc that such an optimisation would be almost impossible to get right."

comment,14263839,,,1493893991,,scarmig,"There&#x27;s a world of difference, in context.<p>One is in kind of an equilibrium, where the costs of a product or service are included as part of the good. Consumers can choose the product that makes legible the costs and labor that went into it. Some suppliers will win, others will lose, but it&#x27;s based on transparent pricing, which markets function best with.<p>The other only sustains low prices through some exogenous means. It could be a VC dumping money to subsidize a product until all other competitors are gone and network effects take over. It could be a company taking revenues from one profitable product line and investing them to subsidize other product spaces where competitors have to rely on making money from the explicit pricing.<p>On the surface they&#x27;re similar, in that one company has consumers choosing their product over another&#x27;s.<p>The difference is what will happen down the line to consumers. In one situation any bad behavior can be quickly corrected by the market.<p>The other is the image of Comcast charging you for a boot stamping on your face forever, even though you never asked for the boot and have requested half a dozen times that they stop the boot stamping on your face service."

So at least the goal of treating Bitcoin like a currency has been met.<p>Those that got in early enough or have already cashed out usually keep their mouth shut. For those who regard it as a speculative asset and only want to get rich and now lament that they missed the early adopter phase, yeah, such people exist. I know several of them personally. It&#x27;s always interesting to argue with them and yes, it would be better if there were regulations to protect them.<p>Greed is a bad investment strategy and it&#x27;s only profit if you are willing to take profit.

I&#x27;m just sitting here ready to laugh.<p>I see, you are not a true Buttcoin believer. Let me paraphrase an old meme: If Bitcoin succeeds, you won&#x27;t have to cash out.<p>Jokes aside, Satoshi never made a promise to not cash out. It&#x27;s likely, he&#x2F;she&#x2F;them are dead or lost the keys to their private wallet. Even in the unlikely case of Satoshi still being alive and having access to the coins, the minute this coins move, the price will plummet.

The first is the rise of sentimentality (Adam Smith, William Lloyd Garrison, et. al.).

comment,14263665,,,1493890849,,binarray2000,"(1) My comment was an addendum to the post which (partly) explained to another post(er) why German companies aren&#x27;t moving their production to cheaper markets. I remind you of this because the author of the article and many people here have a rosy view of the economic situation in Germany. Seeing only the &quot;positives&quot; and blending out the &quot;negatives&quot; because they don&#x27;t fit the official narrative isn&#x27;t helpful for our discussion.<p>(2) Germany is the biggest country in EU (EU != Europe), has the largest workforce and, thus, the largest low-wage sector. Yes, that is correct. But it is not &quot;easy&quot;, as this Eurostat graph shows:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;File:Low-wage_earners_%E2%80%94_employees_(excluding_apprentices)_earning_less_than_two_thirds_of_the_median_gross_hourly_earnings,_2014_(%25_of_employees)_YB17.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;...</a><p>You see Germany in the company with such economic powerhouses as Estonia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia - all of them having a bit worse PERCENTAGE of low-wage workers than Germany. This is not someone&#x27;s perception, or some narrative, these are hard numbers.<p>(3) You obviously didn&#x27;t read the articles I&#x27;ve posted. Especially that from Nachdenkseiten as it lists many other issues not widely spoken about in the mainstream media - neither in Germany nor in other countries. It is an analysis from Prof. Dr. Gerhard Bosch (Geschäftsführender Direktor Institut Arbeit und Qualifikation Universität Duisburg-Essen). While we discuss the article published oh hbr.org, which talks about the causes for the success of the German economy, Mr. Bosch mentions the elephant in the room:<p>&gt; German economic policy continues to be characterised by its excessive focus on exports. As a way of dealing with the euro crisis, the German federal government advises other countries to introduce their own labour market reforms on the model of the Hartz Acts. This policy, however, cannot be applied at will to other countries, since only by abolishing the laws of mathematics would be it possible for all countries to have export surpluses.<p>Meaning: German model doesn&#x27;t work for others. And, it only works for Germany because others take a hit while Germany &quot;takes&quot; a surplus.<p>Yes, German economy&#x2F;society has it&#x27;s qualities. But would it be such a &quot;success&quot; without major influence in EU institutions, in ECB, without Euro, with other countries having their currencies (which they can devalue to make their good cheaper and imported - German - goods more expensive), with customs on its goods, with fairer wages in Germany? I highly doubt it."

comment,14263635,,,1493890233,,erikbye,"&gt; For GPL, it seems like a lot of people (including RMS) value the license more than absolute code quality. They would rather have worse software, under their idealogical license, than use better software under a less restrictive license.<p>RMS wants free software to be as good as non-free. He realizes that takes a lot of work, which he has dedicated his life to. We all realize it takes a lot of work, the difference is, some of us are willing to put in the work.<p>That said, sometimes the &quot;ideology&quot; behind a thing is important.

comment,14263578,,,1493889314,,josteink,"&gt; EDIT: Pragmatically IMO the freedom of the end user matters less because they need more than just access to the source code to derive any value of having that access, whereas for a downstream developer the value of being able to do as they please is extremely direct.<p>Again, like I said, that&#x27;s clearly debatable.<p>First I think we need to shoehorn some terminology into this conversation in order for it to be useful.<p>You have two clearly distinct roles. You call them &quot;developer&quot; and &quot;user&quot;, but that&#x27;s really imprecise and doesn&#x27;t correctly capture the use-cases which we&#x27;re discussing, so here&#x27;s my attempt:<p>* A publisher (what you call a &quot;developer&quot;, someone who releases software, different software, one which will have to &quot;deal&quot; with reciprocal licenses).<p>* A user (one which runs software, usually on devices he own).<p>It may not be the <i>norm</i>, but a user may very well build and modify the software he uses (that is: do development work), and submit patches back upstream (instead of forking&#x2F;bundling the code and modifications in another product). So while clearly a developer, he is first and foremost a user, and he doesn&#x27;t need to care about licensing, since he doesn&#x27;t actually release anything on his own.<p>Example: As a user of a device I buy, I want to be able to modify and replace its firmware when I find it lacking. In this case I&#x27;m a user, not a developer, at least not <i>until the need arises</i>.<p>And a &quot;normal user&quot; may not be able to do all these things, but as others have noted, there may be a pre-existing development community which has pre-modified builds available (like Cyanogendmod, OpenWrt, Coreboot, whatever).<p>In that sense, things being open to me, the user, <i>the owner of the device running the code</i>, has an high value anyhow. Not having control over what runs on my devices is unacceptable in a post-Snowden, emerging IoT-ridden world.<p>And I think those concerns are much more important for the IoT-everywhere world we&#x27;re moving into, than some mere licensing <i>inconveniences</i> for publishers when they free of charge incorporate other people&#x27;s work into their own product."

I can think of two, and would love to hear if anyone can improve them:<p>(a) There&#x27;s a house a mile away from the city. Right now, running a cable to it isn&#x27;t worth it for the X$&#x2F;mo they would pay for internet. Without net neutrality, Comcast will also get 20% of Amazon&#x27;s revenue, and Netflix&#x27;, and the investment starts to make sense. (My criticism: Those 20% will have to be added to Amazon&#x27;s prices, considering their thin margins, and the customer could have just paid the total directly to Comcast, without all the harm to people not in their situation. Also: this argument rapidly loses plausibility for even a small cluster of, say, a dozen houses. If you want to life in a cabin in the woods, slow internet seems like the sort of trade-off it involves. You get clean air, in turn. Although that may be changing, as well).<p>(b) A simple trickle-down theory of network access: Comcast will make so much money, some of it just has to end up in network investment. (criticism: there really isn&#x27;t a point at which a company will say &quot;we have so much money, let&#x27;s spend a little more on investments bound to cost us money&quot;)"

I can understand their idea of wanting to be left alone: Science is a field that by its&#x27; very nature is full of naysayers and sceptics. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing: this is how new science is validated. However, release your ideas too early, and you have a good chance that a whole circus develops around the <i>impossibilities</i> of their ideas or direction, and possibly, Government oversight and regulations before anything is actually ready for any kind of scrutiny.<p>The overall tone of the article strikes me as &quot;We are curious about what Calico is doing, and we are really annoyed they won&#x27;t tell us&quot;.

&gt; Running at 9 min&#x2F;mile more exertion than push-ups? Nope.<p>I agree that to me bicycling at 12-13mph or running at 9 min&#x2F;mile sounds easier than push-ups. But that is because push-ups exercise a much smaller muscle group, that is much easier exhausted (and that is much less trained in my case). I can run at 9 min&#x2F;mile for hours, but will exhaust my chest muscles before 50 push-ups. That doesn&#x27;t mean that energy wise one is harder than the other. My heart rate during push-ups or pull-ups doesn&#x27;t surpass 140 bpm, which is about the same as when running 9 min&#x2F;mile.<p>If you look at the physics: your center of gravity moves about 20cm up and down during a push-up (in 1 second). During running your center of gravity moves up and down 10 cm twice-thrice a second."

Telling them they can&#x27;t is not freedom.<p>You reverse cause and effect. The GPL is what you choose (or in this case choose not) to have the effect you mention. You&#x27;re not forced to use the GPL nor the projects which uses it.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve realised that the GPL licence just causes more pain and frustration to developers.<p>It doesn&#x27;t. If it causes pain and frustration it&#x27;s because GPL forces people into thinking&#x2F;believing into a <i></i>political<i></i> agenda. Disagreeing on political things is always painful. So the problem is not the GPL. The difficulty is that some choose the GPL <i>because</i> of the political thing and therefore, they force (the GPL helps a lot at taht) other developers to interrogate themselves about those political questions. And they may get frustrated or dad or whatever, but ultimately, they realize that they don&#x27;t align with the ideas embodied in the GPL, or in another way, they realize the cost of sticking to the GPL.<p>The GPL is not the problem. It suits people whose mind are aligned with the FSF&#x27;s goals, and for them it&#x27;s perfectly fine. Just realize that it&#x27;s not for you.<p>Now, having practiced the GPL, I can assure you that it definitely embodies the political ideals of the FSF and that sooner or later, you&#x27;ll come to confront with people who don&#x27;t get it, and &quot;confront&quot; is not a weak word.

And I don&#x27;t see much effort put into auto-vectorisation in Graal either, from my occasional browsings of the commit logs. The research in HotSpot JIT compilers seems to be focused more on compiling more dynamic languages like JavaScript and Ruby faster, rather than C++ style numeric code: I guess reflecting a focus on business apps that probably don&#x27;t contain many hot array loops relative to scripting language use.<p>I look forward to benchmarks.

comment,14263383,,,1493886022,,slackingoff2017,"I don&#x27;t think software is much different from anything else in this respect. You could learn any job assuming you&#x27;re fairly intelligent and being taught by somebody decent. In not sure why we churn out degrees now instead of apprenticeships. I assume it&#x27;s an equilibrium where The quality of people coming out of school is &quot;good enough&quot; that it saves the company money on training.<p>If you look at it as a way of companies forcing people to pay for their own training, the proper way to bring apprenticeships back is to make college more selective or expensive. This would increase upward mobility for those that can&#x27;t afford school by forcing companies to train their employees again. However it would probably be seen as an attack on the poor and minorities for making college more exclusive.<p>Put differently, the increased accessibility of college has killed informal forms of education. To undo this would mean making college elitist again because the widespread nature of college education is what causes companies to hire only graduates.<p>Another factor in the downfall of apprenticeships is the inability to weed out people unlikely to succeed because of discrimination laws. In the past it was common to get engineering apprenticeships off the street IF you could pass a series of tests. IQ especially has a strong correlation to job success, and only taking say the top 10% of scores made apprenticeships much more likely to succeed (and less expensive for the company). These tests were found to be biased against minorities and women so disappeared in the 60&#x27;s, around the same time college education became popular among the middle class.<p>Correlation isn&#x27;t causation of course, so I can only speculate on these being driving forces behind the end of job training. Looking back at Germany, an interesting twist is that education is free but the acceptance rate low. Basically college in Germany is elitist, and if my theory holds water this would lead to more on the job training.<p>Another somewhat depressing thing to keep in mind is that HN is a bubble. You need to be fairly smart to be an effective engineer. Most are significantly smarter than the average person, and by popular accounts an odd bunch. It might seem reasonable to people like us to teach people to code by osmosis but to most people programming is incomprehensible and unenjoyable. I saw this first hand in primary school where software programming was an elective. There were 30 or so students in the class and only three of us had any idea what we were doing and interest in writing code."

Paper valuations don&#x27;t pay for groceries &amp; bills &amp; travel.<p>When bank savings interest rates are low (1 - 2%), shares with dividend payouts of 7% and higher look attractive, especially from a stable company (like a national supermarket chain or a telecommunications near-monopoly).  And some stocks have a progressive dividend, ie they pledge to increase their dividend payout per share each year.  (So in my case, one of the shares I bought about 10 years ago now pays out the equivalent of an 18% return to me in dividends every year.)  As the dividend payouts increase, people are prepared to pay more for the stock, so it pushes the share price.  (So that 18% yield stock has since tripled in price, as many investors are happy to just take a 6% return instead.)"

comment,14263305,,,1493885095,,dagw,Comparing the mid to late 90s with today it seems hackers have on the whole become more commercially minded.  Back in the 90s there was a more idealistic and &#x27;punk&#x27; ethos surrounding the hacker scene with documents like the Hacker Manifesto being a thing people actually believed in and aspired to.  The GPL fit right into that.<p>Then the world changed a bit and all of a sudden people realized that you could become both a millionaire and even a billionaire as a software developer.  And do you know what&#x27;s cooler than being part of an idealistic punk scene? A billion dollars!<p>Now licenses that got in the way of you making money weren&#x27;t as attractive anymore.  And licenses that made it easier for you to make money off of software written by other people became the new hot thing.<p>That at least is my naive take on what I&#x27;ve observed over the past 20-odd years.
comment,14263302,,,1493885078,,buserror,"I tend to agree, up to a point, however I still use the GPL because it at least gives me a leg to stand on for people actually ripping your code and selling it as is...

The only reason Linux grew up to this point is that the vendors are <i>forced</i> to contribute back and cooperate (up to a point). Mind you it might also be the reason Linux is so bloated these days, but at least there is no vendor lock in...<p>As a small example, someone decided a few years back to release a &quot;Arduino UI&quot; over my own simavr[0] as an indigogo project. ie trying to be paid to package a demo I made (for free): he had screenshots, a few promises and no source code.

Why does a casino need a license?<p>We all don&#x27;t agree on everything but there&#x27;s plenty of blame to go around if you think of gambling as an addiction (and addiction as a disease to be treated rather than an excuse to kill people). I think of gambling is a disease, casinos are a &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;. Sort of like Google&#x27;s famous &quot; don&#x27;t be evil&quot; motto which recognizes that an organization in this position is likely to steer towards being evil by default and only by constant vigilance can we prevent ourselves from being evil.

It is, in a word, paranoid, and doesn&#x27;t represent a balanced assessment of risk factors.<p>Granted, risk is higher with cryptocurrency given its infancy; I won&#x27;t dispute that. But if we trust brick &amp; mortar banks to have adequate security policies and practices to deal with fiat currency, then the amount of trust we need to place in a competent exchange isn&#x27;t multiple orders of magnitude higher than that. Just as there are security policies to mitigate risk in the world of cash, so are there policies to mitigate risk in the cryptocurrency world.<p>Maybe the risk with an exchange is one order of magnitude higher at the moment vs fiat; that seems like a reasonable amount. But 2-3+? No, particularly given the risks already present for fiat currency. And while we&#x27;re at it, consider hardware failure risk if you&#x27;re storing your own wallet files. What&#x27;s an average failure rate for a storage device per year? 1-3%? Great, I&#x27;m sure you have backups. Not every user can be bothered, but any competent exchange will. Or - on the crypto side - what amount of value would be at risk due to an event like a hard fork? That&#x27;s a risk at the currency level, not at the wallet&#x2F;key level.<p>The overwhelming majority of businesses don&#x27;t live or die based on the opinions of the paranoid; they succeed or fail based on the opinions of the average customer."

Another important area in research is the development of other greener forms of blockchain security such as Proof of Stake, which will most likely replace Proof Of Work once perfected.<p>Theoretically speaking all algorithms are able to be optimized by ASICs. ASIC resistance is not about making ASICs impossible, it&#x27;s about making them expensive. But any secure global PoW currency is going to have enough mining reward to drive ASIC development.<p>The really ASIC resistant algorithms will have an R&amp;D overhead of hundreds of millions. Which means if one player can get in really and keep their R&amp;D secret or patented, they can amortize costs and more easily block newcomers. Overall, even without intentional barriers, you will have a much more centralized coin in the long run.<p>For any coin intending to become worth billions or trillions, you really want to embrace ASICs and design a PoW that makes it as easy as possible for newcomers to profitably develop and manufacture ASICs."

comment,14263089,,,1493881628,,runeks,"It should be noted that the Bitcoin protocol is more difficult to change, compared to other crypto currencies, simply because it&#x27;s the most widely used. The more users&#x2F;implementations a protocol has, the more expensive change will be, simply because it affects more users (more software needs to be rewritten).<p>Similarly, changing the SQL protocol is orders of magnitude more difficult than changing, say, the GraphQL protocol, but does that mean GraphQL is likely to take over SQL? Or is it just a symptom of the fact that SQL is more popular than GraphQL in the first place?<p>A crypto currency that no one uses is really easy to change, because no one will be affected. Framing this as a significant competitive advantage, however, misses the point, since the nimbleness is a direct result of no one using it."

Realistically how often would the average person, even someone living in a rural state, need to catch, clean and cook their own food? How many decades has it been since a significant portion of the population has needed that skill? Probably several generations at least. I bet less than a fraction of a percent of the population lives in a situation such that they don&#x27;t procure most of their food through purchases of the products of agriculture or animal husbandry. A town has to get very small and very remote before periodic trips to the grocery store become so onerous that it&#x27;s actually more efficient to set snares or sit in a tree for days on end waiting for a deer to wander by.<p>I suspect that any scenario in which hunting&#x2F;trapping becomes a valuable skill for a significant portion of the population is also a situation where knowing how to operate an animal drawn vehicle is also a useful skill."

To say that it&#x27;s better than Counter-Strike (which many regard as the epitome of competetive FPS gaming and has stood the test of time in that role for almost as long as Starcraft has done the same for RTS) is an absolute joke.

And as of now with that example portfolio, I definitely <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> invest in it. Having a large btc bias when all the major cryptos are already highly correlated with btc seems redundant, and rebalancing once a week seems like overkill. Also, marketcap is a poor indicator of returns, in case you&#x27;re considering using it for weighting."

comment,14262894,,,1493879072,,ptaipale,"Shame is not the word I&#x27;d argue is important here, even if it is a factor. But reputation matters.<p>With governments, it&#x27;s a lot about the credibility. You could say that it was wise economically for e.g. Argentina to default on its loans in 2001 given the circumstances; however, the default and the associated political rhetoric have cost a great deal to the Argentinian government and people, and it continues its decline, although it was a very wealthy country 80 years ago and effectively avoided the Second World War. The economic and political institutions in the country are not trusted.<p>I live in Finland, which in 1918 suffered a famine after a bloody civil war. The new government took a loan from U.S. creditors in 1919 to buy food. Many other countries who took similar loans at the same time defaulted them at the Great Depression or the following years in 1930&#x27;s. Economically, that would have made a lot of sense.<p>But the Finnish government kept paying it back, even during the beginning of World War II while being attacked by U.S.S.R. This gained a huge positive reputation which helped the country a lot. After the war, the old loan was eventually converted to a fund whose payments were given as university grants and stipends to students coming from Finland to U.S. universities.<p>It would have been quite easy to default in 1920&#x27;s or latest in 1940, and most modern economists would have advised for it, but not doing that was a good move.<p>The loan was eventually finished back in 1984, but the process attracted donors who gave further funding so that the stipend&#x2F;grant system still exists."
comment,14262891,,,1493879046,,Taek,"One could probably write several research papers on the topic. It would be more likely appropriate to have a discussion format, but I&#x27;ll touch (not in depth) on a few of the major points:<p>1. Multiple popular clients implementing the same consensus algorithm. In theory, this means that bugs show up faster and you end up with something closer to the designed specification. In practice, if you ever find one tiny little difference (even a case where one has a bug and the other doesn&#x27;t) you can fork the network and take advantage of the nodes that will be on the minority chain.<p>Eth defends this by suggesting you run multiple clients. Well, now you&#x27;ve doubled the resource requirements, and you force users to come up with some contingency plan in the event that the clients disagree. And if the two clients you pick are different from the two clients of much of the rest of the network, you can <i>still</i> fork the network.<p>2. Super complex contract vm. The thing so far has been a massive magnet for bugs. Bitcoin&#x27;s relatively simple contact engine still has vulnerabilities being discovered in 2017 (mostly minor performance issues at this point), eth is likely to be finding bugs in their much more complicated (both theoretically and in practice) system.<p>3. Asic resistant PoW. No PoW is asic resistant in theory, you can always make hardware specifically specialized to your task. All it means is that eventually someone will figure out how to do it, and when they do the up-front cost may be billions of dollars - a cost that only one player will ever be able to afford, especially if they keep all their optimizations secret. Bad choice unless you think you can switch to PoS in time, but that&#x27;s a bad idea for a completely separate set of reasons.<p>4. Centralized dev team with obvious conflicts of interest and no scruples about interfering with the networks operation to get stuff done. If a government decides to compromise when Ethereum, you could get pretty far by compromising just three people (Lubin, Wood, Buterin). Bitcoin has no such group, the devs are an amorphous blob who all suspect eachother of being CIA and would never accept a proposal merely because of the name of the submitter.<p>5. General support for hard forks. If you wanted to get a bad change into bitcoin, you&#x27;d mostly need to hard fork. The community actively resists hardforks. Change is very hard, but at least that means bad change is also very hard.<p>6. Really sketchy blockchain download. You trust a hash from a miner and then start downloading blocks after that. This means the miner can easily cheat you. Also means you can get started a lot faster, but it&#x27;s a big security problem.<p>7. Really bad scalability. Much worse than Bitcoin&#x27;s​. The EVM is very expensive, and a simple transaction is going to tax you computer a lot more than on Bitcoin. Doing 1M txns per day will probably not be possible for most nodes, and Eth is within an order of magnitude of hitting. Eth also doesn&#x27;t have a flagship application yet, but all of the current ones under construction do not play nice with the scaling constraints. BTC is struggling to do payments. How will will eth cope when it&#x27;s doing:<p>Payments<p>Prediction markets<p>Name resolution<p>Content attribution<p>And who knows what else<p>Scalability is a security concern, because when the shit hits the fan you are going to have a bunch of incumbents pulling every which way to make scaling work. Eth has already made massive compromises to keep up with their current load. It&#x27;s going to get worse. My guess is that eth will continue to favor scaling over security, and they will end up in a 12 full nodes worldwide type of situation. That&#x27;s very very very much worse than Bitcoin&#x27;s situation of 12 miners.<p>8. In general, eth culture just doesn&#x27;t consider security. They think blockchains are largely magic shields that do all the hard work for you, and despite being bitten a bunch of times already they continue prioritizing innovation. Fine, but you asked why I think bitcoin is more secure, and a culture of mistrust and slow adoption goes a long way to achieving security.<p>I could probably find another 10 things to talk about but I&#x27;ll stop here. Ethereum has selling points over Bitcoin, but they are not security​ or decentralization by a long shot."

It then somehow seems to conclude that this was all Germany’s fault instead of being the fault of the people in those peripheral countries with ‘economic implosion, rising inequality and widespread corruption’.<p>The article does mention wage suppression in the beginning but does not give a good argument why the wage suppression as observed in Germany since the early 2000&#x27;s is a bad thing -- if wages are inflated and you need to compete with China for manufacturing, then you can either scrap your manufacturing or suppress wages, there’s not that much of an alternative there.<p>My sibling comment arguing that the largest low-wage sector in the EU is somehow inherently bad is also misguided: if the alternative is much higher unemployment, low-wage jobs are still preferable to no jobs, <i>especially</i> if they come with the usual social security mechanism, as is increasingly the case again."

BTC also completely runs the economy of the DarkNet.<p>I believe all cryptocurrencies are somewhat propped up by speculation, but BTC is still the preferred currency for the vast majority of people using cryptocurrencies for the actual exchange of goods and services. That&#x27;s how BTC derives its value (+ speculation, but very few people are willing to speculate at $1500 USD per coin).<p>As for the other cryptocurrencies, I would say that a lot of their value comes from people wishing to get in on the next &quot;BTC&quot; for $20-$80&#x2F;coin."

Structures were usually super expensive, and resources (or, in some versions, units themselves) were acquired only by owning those control points. No allied victories.<p>Once the balance was dialed in (lots of maps had nation-specific special units and stuff, which made it tough), it could create some of the most interesting, dynamic UMS games I ever played. Sometimes they&#x27;d go literally hours. Early land grabs followed by huge back-and-forths, usually only limited by the sprite limit (my own maps avoided sprite-y units like Carriers, Goliaths, and Valkyries because of it; lots of Marines and Firebats, trying to make them feel like Diplomacy &quot;armies&quot; that could plausibly bounce off one another).<p>The only games I can recall that were more fun were Last Man Standing Regicide (&quot;Shimo-style&quot;) games in Age of Empires II."

However, there are some limitations -- see my other reply.<p>(Constructing Protobuf objects, meanwhile, will usually be pretty much identical to POCS, since that&#x27;s essentially what Protobuf objects are.)<p>There is a common myth that Cap&#x27;n Proto &quot;just moves the serialization work to object-build time&quot;, but ultimately does the same amount of work. This is not true: Although you could describe Cap&#x27;n Proto as &quot;doing the serialization at object build time&quot;, the work involved is not significantly different from building a regular in-memory object."

comment,14262552,,,1493873789,,supremesaboteur,"A few months ago there was a story about starting an ISP on Hacker News [1] and the comments section was about how hard it is to start one.

Google can afford to lose some money and perhaps it could improve the ISP competition in the US.<p>Also reading about the general history of the Internet, even though initial work was done by DARPA, it did not become the world wide network until commercial interests ( and free market capitalism ) took over [2].

comment,14262528,,,1493873300,,Cymen,"There is a whole movement around this called Software Craftsmanship.

The one I&#x27;m most familiar with is 8th Light which started in Chicago but is now in Los Angeles, London, and New York City too.<p>Their approach is more spend 5-9 months having the apprentice do mostly directed self-study, then a kind of final project and other work and, if they pass, an offer of employment. It&#x27;s a really interesting model that seems to have worked well for them -- they attract developers from both traditional backgrounds and non-traditional.<p>They have a page that goes into what apprenticeship means to them here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;8thlight.com&#x2F;apprenticeship&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;8thlight.com&#x2F;apprenticeship&#x2F;</a>"

comment,14262522,,,1493873136,,Taek,"Bitcoin has by far the greatest amount of research and intellectual effort driving it, and it&#x27;s far from a static protocol. It doesn&#x27;t need to have gotten everything perfect, it needs to change just quickly (or slowly) enough to retain its core value proposition vs. other cryptocurrencies.<p>Maybe it will get replaced, maybe not. But there&#x27;s no question to me that Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized, most secure, safest option of all the cryptocurrencies, including the nasty miner situation happening right now.<p>Ethereum is in second place, but the dev team has worked hard to maintain full control over the direction of the protocol, including frequent hardforks and promise of future hardforks.<p>Ethereum offers a lot that Bitcoin does not, but if the valuation were to pass Bitcoin&#x27;s I think it would be fair to state that it&#x27;s because the market has chosen to prefer low security, low decentralisation, high (yet unrealized) innovation potential over a decentralized payment system.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a bad thing for bitcoin, and I also wouldn&#x27;t consider Bitcoin dead or misplaced if it gets passed by ethereum​ in market cap. The decentralization is what is meaningful to me, and I don&#x27;t know anything else remotely close."

comment,14262507,,,1493872871,,pfooti,"Another thing to look at is nativescript. It is more or less an angular-based analog to react native.<p>I used react native to build a prototype (so thin experience here, it was just a prototype to compare between ionic, react native, and nativescript). It was okay, but felt a lot less complete and polished than ionic. There is some platform-specific stuff and the tooling isn&#x27;t nearly as much fun. The ionic CLI is great. It made me a bit sad that I no longer need my hand-tooled complicated gulp scripts for express dev server, live reload, live rebuilds, and so on, but on the other hand, things work great out of the box. Tooling isn&#x27;t nearly as good with react native or nativescript.<p>Also, the react native layouts are only mostly html. As in, there&#x27;s some stuff that doesn&#x27;t translate well. A well-laid-out react app could get ported across, sure, and react native will get you 90% of the way there, but the last 10% is a bit tricky. Flexbox, for example, isn&#x27;t fully supported (or wasn&#x27;t six months ago, life comes at you fast).<p>Ultimately, they&#x27;re all worth a look, and I think the &quot;which one should we use?&quot; question is best answered by trying them all out and seeing what best fits your needs."

comment,14262348,,,1493870432,,FullMtlAlcoholc,"&gt;Valve basically own a significant fraction of its success to community: CS (based on modder produce) Dota2 (bought from a modder); these 2 are their big revenue sources.<p>I simply do not understand this. Moders created an entirely new genre and basically brought Competitive Gaming to the masses, yet Blz won&#x27;t allow modding on Overwatch. I&#x27;ve had discussions with people who support this and their rationale basically boils down to (1) they don&#x27;t want to fracture the userbase and (2) they love the design and don&#x27;t want to upset it. Both are ill founded. The userbase is in the millions and mods would get ppl like me to play again. Also, any graphical mods can simply run on my local machine, exactly like DotA2.<p>The game engine itself is superb and possibly hanfles&#x2F;plays better than any other FPS with maybe Destiny being the only competition. 
There is no doubt modders would create a superior gaming experience. Learn from Bethesda"

The idea is to verify the a product-market fit for a solution before you sink in all the expenses, basically on a smaller scale. So far I have not found a fundamentally different approach other than small cost reductions like not using a polished steel tool etc."

comment,14262318,,,1493869852,,ajwin,I see the problem being that if net neutrality disappears it gives the internet companies good reason to slow down the internet generally so that the content providers need to purchase the speed ups. Investment in general network throughput will reduce profit from fast lane sales and so big companies will reduce investment in their networks outside of fast lanes. Cost flows down the tree. We are already paying for the internet... does it make sense to pay twice? This is why I think no consumer should be for the axing of the net neutrality rules. In general this is bad for everyone. Its like creating an energy market... It leads to people reducing generation capacity and prices sky rocketing while service&#x2F;quality reduces. Good for the ownership class bad for humanity.

comment,14262099,,,1493867038,,gfodor,"One thing that I think can get lost is that to &quot;Get into VR&quot; if you are already a great software engineer you may not need to learn anything new, just find a place to work where you can immediately apply the skills you already have, towards a VR-oriented product. From there, look for opportunities to develop VR-specific skills like the ones mentioned in this article.<p>For example, at our company (AltspaceVR) we have a <i>huge</i> need for engineers of all stripes, not just the types of folks you&#x27;d normally think of for what is traditionally thought of as a &quot;game&quot; (this term, too, is probably about to become very stale.) It&#x27;s a huge challenge for us to get great engineers who are not in the games industry to realize that working in this space, depending on the application, can be much like hopping, say, from a web app to a mobile app. Are there new skills to learn? Yes, tons. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you are starting at ground zero nor that your current skills aren&#x27;t going to highly valued and critical to an organization&#x27;s success.<p>We need people to help build our backend systems (Rails, Kafka, etc), manage ops (Ansible, Datadog, AWS), create deployment tools, build UI (React, but rendered in VR!), work on our mobile app (React Native), build analytics pipelines, the list goes on. In fact I&#x27;d argue if you are looking at an organization that doesn&#x27;t understand the need for such a wide spectrum engineering talent to deliver a great application, you should be careful!<p>Basically for VR companies who are working on <i>applications</i> that will leverage VR, the &quot;VR-specific&quot; slice of the engineering work is probably a lot smaller than you&#x27;d expect, just like for companies developing mobile applications, the &quot;mobile specific&quot; part of engineering work is only a part of the effort.<p>In other words, don&#x27;t think you can&#x27;t get into this field just because you aren&#x27;t a graphics geek.<p>(Oh yeah, we&#x27;re hiring :) <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;altvr.com&#x2F;careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;altvr.com&#x2F;careers</a>)"

There is talk of reducing benefits, which is causing a situation much like a run on banks to occur.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few proposed solutions such as having the state of Texas help pay, to pillaging funds from DART (public transit), to tax increases.<p>It is a complete mess, and PR must be in such a bad position. In Dallas&#x27; case, it is obviously corruption that caused the problem, with no penalty, and the only recourse is to penalize those that did not cause the problem.

I don&#x27;t think you can recover the password of a google account through its own gmail inbox.<p>Although I guess if you had a circular recovery chain of this google account depending on a different email that depended on this google account, the attacker could use your email to recover the other email then use the other email to recover this google account. So it might be wise to change the passwords to everything."
comment,14261958,,,1493864842,,zkms,"People with a better understanding of the LTE protocols than I do -- is it possible to make an LTE relay (like this &quot;magic box&quot;) but without any cooperation from the network operator (so no access to any cryptographic keys&#x2F;secrets and no special&#x2F;internal access to the operator&#x27;s network)?<p>I know that to avoid self-interference, the relay needs to either implement frequency separation between its link to the real eNB and its link to the UEs it serves, or implement time separation. AIUI, time separation gets done by (for DL) not transmitting to real eNB when needing to listen to UE and (for UL) by not transmitting to UE when needing to listen to eNB. I think this gets more complicated when DL and UL are in the same band (TDD LTE).<p>Since I have no access to any key material, I cannot read anything that&#x27;s encrypted and I cannot modify anything that&#x27;ll get verified cryptographically or gets used as an input to a KDF (changes in KDF inputs will lead to different keys on the UE than the network expects). Given this limitation, is it possible to either:<p>1. Demodulate signals from the real eNB (on its DL band), replace any reference to the real DL band (in the master&#x2F;system information blocks) with our DL band, and radiate that <i>on a different DL band</i> to the UE -- and do the same transform with the UL bands. Is it possible to fool the UE this way? Is the UARFCN used as a KDF input or talked about over some signalling radio bearer in RRC &#x2F; NAS messages (which afaict, is encrypted and thus inaccessible)?<p>2. Is it possible to intercept&#x2F;consistently modify&#x2F;pass-on scheduling requests &#x2F; resource grants for both UL and DL without breaking anything? Are scheduling requests &#x2F; resource grants ever encrypted or otherwise protected by cryptography? Does anything above that layer actually know&#x2F;care about the precise scheduling? Would this be a feasible method to ensure that there&#x27;s no self-interference at the relay (by telling the UE to radiate on UL at a different time than the relay will radiate on UL to the eNB, and similarly for DL)?"

Apple showed this pretty obviously, but I think many companies would have most of their software engineers quit before accepting such a request, even if it was a direct order. The government cannot order you personally to write software, that&#x27;s blatant first amendment violations, even if they figure out a way to order a company to do so. When politicians see one of their largest corporations disappearing over night, and the associated loss of world power and tax revenue, from engineers quitting vs a police force trying to force things like this... I think there will be some reconsidering that would happen."

These underlying structures are complex and intertwined with one another.<p>When the average person comes out and votes, &quot;Why should I pay for other&#x27;s health problems?&quot;...it sounds fair at a local level. At a societal level, it&#x27;s a major problem.<p>Most voters are not going to vote at a societal level."

Centralized food markets with price controls always creates shortage. It&#x27;s simple economics.<p>If your economic system can&#x27;t efficiently feed people, more complex industries will be even harder. Not to mention building new industries.<p>The failures of their socialist experiment go far deeper than simply a non diversified industry. The drop in the petro industry showed immediately how fragile the massive spending schemes and nationalization was.<p>As Thomas Sowell said (paraphrasing), the problem with redistribution is that you can only take someone&#x27;s money&#x2F;property once, you can&#x27;t take their ability to continually produce goods. So when that well dries up the cracks in the system become apparent.<p>The wikipedia article on the Venezuelan economy is a good read about the risks of centralized planned economies."

The type of activity that I see isn&#x27;t close to what would be considered an extreme-worst case scenario in the industry.<p>Assuming the right economic incentives these groups are over time able to duplicate about any behavior that would be seen by a typical customer.  For example, they can effectively remote desktop into a device and create a sleeper account and then come back to the exact same device a week later once the probation period has expired and execute a larger attack.<p>Also it is hard to fully understand that markets where labor isn&#x27;t scarce fundamentally organize themselves differently.  For example one recent attack that I&#x27;d see involved multiple attempts from multiple IP addresses and multiple devices all within seconds of each other and using the same credit card for registration.  For a while I marveled at the technical skills that would be required to orchestrate such an attack until I realized that it likely was likely a dozen people in a room sharing the same credit card number and launching the attack in a coordinated fashion.  Low tech, but extremely effective when labor is cheap."

about building schools. With all due respect
[to Hewlett-Packard’s e-inclusion efforts], it’s
not about curriculum or content. It’s about leveraging
the children themselves.<p>&gt;David Cavallo, OLPC’s chief education architect,
says, “We’re hoping that these
countries won’t just make up ground
but will jump into a new educational
environment.”<p>The OLPC people thought they were going to cause a literal, actual revolution in learning. Didn&#x27;t happen."

comment,14261541,,,1493858392,,Arnavion,"&quot;The Jealous Reporter&quot; section is entirely about this. Start from &quot;But the judges and the experts could not tell the tapes apart.&quot;<p>In particular:<p>&gt;The reporter who had gotten the exclusive story had been convinced at the time that Mick Ali knew the secret, but the reporter could not pass his conviction on to the judges in court or to the television audiences either.<p>&gt;Mick Ali had achieved his real objective. He wanted, in fact, to show that it is possible to convince without revealing, and so without unveiling his secret."
comment,14261538,,,1493858372,,luckydude,"What he said.   And some more details: all of those pictures (and all of my pictures to date) are jpeg right off the camera.  No post processing, no HDR (which is why I&#x27;m proud of that fog picture.  That&#x27;s a freaking jpeg shot straight into the sun and I&#x27;ve got details in the shadows).<p>And the hawk stuff is usually a 600mm f4 lens.  A touch different than a 56mm equiv.  And one of those was on a 7D II, so 1.6x crop factor, so 960mm equiv.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll probably buy that phone because the best camera is the one you have and you always have your phone.  But it&#x27;s never gonna replace that 200mm f2.0 lens with that yummy yummy bokeh.  I&#x27;ll happily be the dinosaur that is carrying around that heavy stuff as long as I can lift it.  Makes me happy."

Everyone that I know pointed me to this new drug, it&#x27;s called Sovaldi... it is a drug that treats Hepatitis C, which is caused by a virus, and the disease itself goes to work on your liver, it inflames it, it scars it, it can cause liver cancer, cirrhosis, it can be fatal, and for the longest time the treatments that they had weren&#x27;t that great or they just had wretched side effects, and along comes Sovaldi.  It&#x27;s one pill, twelve weeks, you take it with some other antiviral meds, it&#x27;s a super simple treatment option, and the side effects are very minimal.  It was kind of like the wonder drug.  So a lot of doctors start to prescribe it.  In the first half of 2013 70,000 people in the United States were treated, and it had a 95% rate of cure, in other words the virus was erradicated... but this drug costs $1000 dollars a pill, for one pill that I take one a day...&quot;</i><p>Now imagine how much a cure for aging would cost.<p>[1] - <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radiolab.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;what-year-life-worth&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radiolab.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;what-year-life-worth&#x2F;</a>"

comment,14261355,,,1493856119,,gumby,"&gt; What shapes our legal systems the most IMO is the idea of guilt and punishment.<p>That may true today, but that simplistic model waxes and wanes with the times.<p>Notice how prisons departments, in particular those formed in the late 19th century on the east coast of the US, are often called &quot;department of <i>corrections</i>&quot; and the jails &quot;<i>penitentiaries</i>&quot;.  During a reformist period the idea is that the criminal would have time to reflect on their crime (be penitent) and correct their error.  It reflects a more hopeful, less manichean view of society.<p>The gradual abolition of the death penalty happened at the end of such a period; it&#x27;s revival in the US happened as a more binary world view returned.<p>Victorian England was definitely hard core on the &quot;punish&quot; side, even punishing the poor, but did abandon some of the more extreme ideology (e.g. dropping the practice of trying and hanging animals that killed humans).<p>I actually think your characterization is not quite correct: I think what&#x27;s reflected is a re-emergence of the idea of the christian idea of original sin: certain people are inherently bad and deserve punishment; thus whatever they do can be taken as an excuse to exact justice (and even have them finance it!) while others are deserving of &quot;charity&quot; (i.e. being judged by a more generous standard)"

comment,14261283,,,1493855416,,grandalf,"&gt; We should try to think of some concrete steps to resist this. It feels like we have to try, since there&#x27;s so much at stake.<p>Great point.  One idea I had recently is to start an organization in the same spirit as Open AI called <i>OpenSurveillance</i> that builds and releases all sorts of useful tools for thwarting surveillance efforts or acting as an adversary to an entity with pervasive surveillance power (generally speaking, corrupt regimes around the world).<p>I think it would entail a combination of social&#x2F;operational and technological tools, and would be useful for defensive and offensive efforts.<p>When OpenAI releases a state of the art facial recognition algorithm, it becomes obvious how the technology might be used for good or for evil. The same goal would apply.<p>Perhaps one utility conducts an analysis of public social media data to determine the best strategy for bribing or compromising an adversary.  Another could explain how to use a HackRF YARDStick One to track the movement of an adversary via tire air pressure sensors.  Another might utilize an infra-red camera to determine which entrances and exits of a building are slow to close and could offer time to sneak in.<p>Still other tools might be a user-friendly rootkit installer for easy installation on a spouse or boss&#x27;s device, etc., or maybe a program that trains a fleet of drones to follow a person all day, causes vehicle engine failure, etc.<p>The basic idea would be to highlight enough about reality so that the security (and privacy) implications of the policies can be weighed accurately by the public.  By putting all the tools in one place and releasing polished, thoughtful products, the organization would help the public understand the privacy&#x2F;security tradeoffs much better.<p>Basically a modern Anarchist&#x27;s Cookbook for the surveillance age.<p>Disclaimer:  It is not the intent of this post to discourage people to break laws, simply to use their vote and influence to peacefully change laws."

&quot;Does Medicare Pay For Long Term Care?<p>NO.  After a 3 day hospital stay, Medicare pays 100% of the cost, but only for the first 20 days of skilled nursing care. For days 21 through 100, you are responsible for a co-payment.  As of this date, the daily co-pay rate is $148 per day.<p>But it gets worse:  After 100 days of care in a nursing home, Medicare stops paying altogether, and you are responsible for all future costs, unless there is a new 3 day qualifying hospital stay (which then re-sets the 100 day clock).<p>You also need to be aware that Medicare does not pay for “custodial care.”  If you or a loved one are in need of custodial care, it must be paid for either by writing a check, by private long-term care insurance, or by Medi-Cal.&quot;<p>I am not going to bother providing you with links because you are obviously not reading anything.  If you are truly interested in understanding the issues you need to spend half a day googling around to build a better image of what reality looks like.<p>Also, my wife is a doctor.  She, among other things, has dealt with precisely the segment &quot;served&quot; by all of these programs for at least ten years.  She has left that practice.  And so have tons of doctors.  This is the other side of the equation.<p>These programs work for some but, on the aggregate, they are a disaster.  It is impossible for doctors to provide good care.  Patients are getting screwed right and left.  My wife would easily see a dozen patients a week for free because there was no possible way to justify doing it under these programs.<p>The vast majority of people are extremely ignorant of the realities in US health care.<p>Anyhow, that&#x27;s the end of it.

Just because you know have encryption doesn&#x27;t mean that has changed. Similar to how the NSA didn&#x27;t suddenly stop doing signal intelligence just because they allegedly &quot;lost the crypto wars&quot;.<p>&gt; Nobody would reasonably argue that extreme surveillance measures, patriot act, etc., is necessary to stop the vast majority of crimes from occurring, so why is it so easy for seemingly serious&#x2F;intelligent people to think this nonsense is reasonable?<p>It&#x27;s a presumably a &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; and &quot;nobody got fired for choosing more surveillance&quot; kind of a thing.<p>&gt; Terrorism is a political word to describe political enemies of the state, yet the patriot act and surveillance machinery has been used in enforcement of many other kinds of (less serious) crime.<p>Terrorism is just the ultimate argument of people in the establishment.

Also, I think that if this (Electron-based apps) keeps getting the type of attention it has been getting (people who are used to web technologies using it for native apps), it will push on Google and hardware manufacturers to start optimizing this stuff more and more. If eventually Electron apps run blazing fast and take miniscule amounts of CPU (not to mention CPUs will continue to get better and faster and more efficient), wouldn&#x27;t it be better for everyone?

comment,14261118,,,1493853532,,kirrent,"This isn&#x27;t a very useful comparison. For one, according to their FCC application SpaceX is planning on launching satellites with a mass of less than 400kg. For comparison, SES-10, a communications satellite SpaceX launched recently, had a mass of around 5300kg. Secondly, they&#x27;re planning on deploying them to an altitude of 1000km. Again, for comparison, SES-10 went to geostationary orbit, which is a reasonably common communications satellite orbit, at 36000km altitude, though the Falcon 9 only had to push it into GTO, which still takes quite a lot of energy.<p>Finally, the plan is obviously contingent on bringing launch costs further down and realising economies of scale in the satellite manufacture. I&#x27;m not sure if they can do it, but being able to launch at least 10, and maybe even as many as 20 at once makes a large difference."

With these satellites orbiting ~30-34x closer to Earth, the satellites would need to have significantly less mass if they were going to not have their orbital distance not degrade too quickly. I don&#x27;t know what the expected lifespan of these satellites will be, but I assume they will eventually burn up in the atmosphere."

comment,14261016,,,1493852609,,grandalf,"From his perspective as the head of the FBI whose job it is to achieve outcomes within the law, of course Comey advocates encryption backdoors. He would likely also advocate allowing the FBI to suspend the bill of rights for any suspect during the duration of an investigation, and he&#x27;d quite likely prefer that the FBI be legally allowed to torture suspects if extreme techniques were viewed as likely to result in useful information.  To law enforcement, the rights of a suspect are a barrier to many convictions.<p>How did we get to this point?   Nobody would reasonably argue that extreme surveillance measures, patriot act, etc., is necessary to stop the vast majority of crimes from occurring, so why is it so easy for seemingly serious&#x2F;intelligent people to think this nonsense is reasonable?<p>Members of our government are so indoctrinated about stopping &quot;terrorism&quot; that they have lost all sense of perspective.  Terrorism is a political word to describe political enemies of the state, yet the patriot act and surveillance machinery has been used in enforcement of many other kinds of (less serious) crime.<p>I am surprised anyone can still use the word &quot;terrorism&quot; with a straight face anymore after it&#x27;s become so clear that there is no large existential threat (merely the occasional zealot who acts out due to his&#x2F;her own mental health issues).

comment,14260908,,,1493851674,,grandalf,"When issues of local government financial problems come up, I think it&#x27;s important to remember that local governments are typically not able to undertake deficit spending the way the Federal government is.<p>If the US Federal government were prevented from running a budget deficit, we&#x27;d likely see a lot more solvency issues and financial failures of many sub-organizations within government due to bad budgeting. It would also be a lot harder for our leaders to start wars or get away with sloppy cost estimates of their grandiose ideas.<p>My argument is not that government should be small, simply that its spending should reflect its income and the results of its spending should be easily correlated with their cost.<p>Since the Federal government takes the lion&#x27;s share of income taxes, local governments are constrained in their ability to generate income. Yet for most people, local governments provide the vast majority of the useful government services they enjoy.<p>So while it may seem that the Federal government is comparatively stable and responsible, the reality is that it&#x27;s simply far less accountable to anyone and is able to use that lack of accountability to launder its reputation.  States (or local governments) do not have the same luxury."

comment,14260857,,,1493851157,,lf275,"Most governments don&#x27;t receive loans with adjustable rates, but they plan their budgets with the expectation that they can refinance their debt once their loans mature. Most governments have regular debt maturities that they must meet, and they would be in big trouble if they can&#x27;t refinance those loans.<p>It is also important to separate local governments from the sovereign federal government. The federal government is allowed to print money to cover its debts, which dramatically reduces the concern among creditors that it may default. Local governments have no such option, however; they can only address their deficit by reducing spending or raising taxes. Both options are politically unpopular (hence why most politicians do nothing and pass the buck to their successors), and may be counterproductive because the local citizens can just pack up and move if taxes are increased, or if public services deteriorate.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that the most attractive way to raise government revenue is to actually attract more productive citizens to move there and increase the tax base (aka how California managed to dig itself out of its immediate financial hole). However, this is obviously very difficult to achieve in practice."

comment,14260617,,,1493849123,,palakchokshi,I think he missed the point about TV ad budget not moving to the likes of Netflix or Amazon. The reason it hasn&#x27;t moved is not because the audience is limited but because the companies in question don&#x27;t want to pollute their viewers&#x27; experience with Ads. Compare that to YouTube which is free and does have Ads.<p>Viewing habits are shifting but so is public opinion on Ads. The future of Ads on these internet TV sites is going to be the same as it was for traditional TV albeit a bit more targeted. Instead of TV networks controlling the viewing data in the future internet TV services will control it.<p>so the potential of a startup to take advantage of that data is going to be minimal since it will be guarded like gold.

comment,14260605,,,1493849036,,anigbrowl,"Two (heavily loaded) questions.<p>First: <i>what you do with a debt is to you pay it off</i><p>Why? not all debts are created equal. Some contracts are unconscionable, and there&#x27;s a related question of why people should be obligated on contracts that were negotiated on their behalf but in bad faith. I&#x27;m not saying that describes all of Puerto Rico&#x27;s debts, but bad faith contracts are common enough that that they shouldn&#x27;t just be passively accepted.<p>Of course I know this has been litigated a lot already and I don&#x27;t expect you to start over that whole process from the beginning, but I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical of blanket moral assertions like this.<p>Second: I presume that, like most places, there are a lot of poor but more-or-less honest people who know little of complex business and governance affairs but are heavily impacted by them, to their economic detriment; and I presume further that there are rather fewer people who are expert at conducting such affairs, and have enriched themselves through this knowledge without having provided equitable value in return to those they have been dealing with.<p>Has anyone explored the idea of prosecuting the latter group and confiscating ill-gotten gains? While doing so risks infringing upon cherished concepts of property rights and due process if not conducted correctly, bankruptcy is a singular event that results from some breakdown or conceptual weakness of The Rules, and in collective contexts it seems only natural that the pain of bankruptcy should be distributed in approximate proportion to the pleasure that preceded the bankruptcy.<p>After all, one of the practical benefits of wealth is the ability to spend a lot of resources on placing procedural barriers between your wealth and anyone else who might want to make a claim upon it, whereas poor people are generally limited to hoping their door is strong enough to keep out wolves. The degree of legal or physical security you can afford is not necessarily correlated with the validity of one&#x27;s moral claim on the property in question."

comment,14260599,,,1493849001,,lf275,"It&#x27;s not an ethical failure because most of the participants understand that it is high risk&#x2F;reward. That is why most start-up firms offer equity to their employees, and it is almost impossible for a new startup to borrow debt from banks (unless its personally guaranteed, or extremely expensive) before it has gained traction with its business model.<p>On the other hand, governments are perceived to be reliable borrowers, so they can receive low interest rate loans and are expected to repay their debt. There is not really a way for governments to issue equity like companies, so if governments become lackadaisical about paying their debts, then we should expect their loans to become much more expensive as well, and this could aggravate the financial distress of  many high indebted public entities that are already struggling to pay the bills."

comment,14260536,,,1493848558,,VLM,"The problem with that is large scale economic forces.  Sometimes there is not much opportunity &quot;supply&quot; so the price of an asset is wildly bid upward and it seems immoral to not permit the owners to keep their windfall.  However fundamentally everyone&#x27;s about the same on average so the bidding process is really a selection system to award the asset and the obligation to fund the loan payment stream to the least financially responsible &quot;winner&quot;.  There&#x27;s some economic term for this along the lines of auction winners dilemma.  The guy who lost out in the bidding last place because he was only willing to pay $200K is ironically the guy most likely to pay the bank back its $200K whereas the &quot;winner&quot; who bid $400K to win is incredibly likely to default.  Then add a bunch of social engineering such that we all earn equal chance at loans from a bank, and the inevitable result of a system with a pinched supply is the only people earning assets are the people very comfy with screwing the bank and people not willing to screw the bank are going to be eternal renters or homeless or otherwise asset free.  So supply weakness freezes the people most likely to pay the bank back out of the economy.  Then when it collapses, get the government to bail them out because who can imagine modern life without banks taking their cut?<p>Just saying, bubbles &#x2F; relative lack of supply times are a really bad time to be a moral and ethical purchaser.  You&#x27;re either not gonna win and a crook will win, or you&#x27;ll have to become that crook who willfully screws the bank.<p>Meanwhile centrally controlled low interest rates mean money is sloshing looking for any return, any.  Everything higher return got financialized.  So loan money is going to be aggressively thrown at those willing to take out large loans and pretend they&#x27;ll pay back.  A flood in the money supply due to low interest rates gets the same result in the long run as a pinch in worthwhile asset supply."

Democratic also (but not only) refers to the rule of law, separation of powers, branches of government,  bicameral legislative branch, independent judiciary, and  associated checks and balances.<p>&gt; what&#x27;s happening in India sounds more like the gradual march of bureaucracy and its exploitation by interested parties rather than a will or even whim of the majority of voters.<p>Voters are a) whimsical because of and b) manipulable thru appeals to blind emotions (e.g. fear and hope).  The antidote is a thoughtful electorate.  This requires an educated society but more importantly a highly ethical society.<p>And so I believe what&#x27;s happening in India is a program based on the realization that you can&#x27;t have individual liberty and collective democracy without personal responsibility and civic accountability.  There is and will be resentment - so until it becomes a way of life some broad coercive measures are being used to enforce policy.  You can call this illiberal or authoritarian - or you can call it pragmatic.  The key for it to be perceived as pragmatic is for the central government to swiftly take down any internal corruption. It will reinforce the integrity of such coercive measures and amplify the ethos of &quot;accountability&quot;.<p>p.s. an ideal&#x2F;utopian liberal democracy might be a fiction but so are all of our aspirations"

Default is an option specifically written into every debt contract out there. There should be no more shame in choosing to default as there would be for choosing to exercise a stock option that causes your counterparty lose all his money. Lenders reap a huge premium for doing nothing but assuming the risk of default. If there was zero risk there should be zero premium.<p>No surprise that it&#x27;s mainly bankers pushing the &quot;it&#x27;s immoral to default&quot; line."

There is plenty of free and low-cost software out there to help with designing such rockets (and more than a few books).<p>Lastly - if you want - you can even make your own engines from easily sourced materials (sugar rocket engines are easily made using powdered sugar and tree stump remover, for instance, stuffed&#x2F;poured into paper tubes or PVC pipe). You can find plenty of information on the internet too about these designs.<p>So - instead of building a non-flying pretend rocket - build a flying real one, strap a gopro to it, and launch!"

comment,14260008,,,1493845054,,scythe,"&gt;Part of Thomas&#x27;s dissent seems based in the fact that Nelson and Madden had been convicted, so at that point in time the state was entitled to those fees, and that the fees went into the public pool. The later overturn of convictions didn&#x27;t change the fact that the state was at one point entitled.<p>I think it&#x27;s an interesting argument. But I think you also have to consider why the money is considered to be &quot;in the public pool&quot;, and whose interests are at stake when it is. It is clearly in the defendant&#x27;s interest that the money is still considered a taking as long as he is alive. It is only in the state&#x27;s interest in the event that the defendant is exonerated or in the case that the money must be tracked explicitly. It is an observational fact that some convicts will be exonerated.<p>It seems therefore that the interest of the state must outweigh the interests of exonerated defendants in order for us to assume the money can be considered <i>only</i> as part of the public pool after it is taken. When we ask whether it is a <i>compelling</i> interest that the state be able to retain money from vacated convictions or that all convicted money be tracked, it seems that this would be the case only if the state&#x27;s financial status were dependent on money obtained from criminal convictions. Such a state would seem to resemble pre-civilized governments and it is this assumption that I reject with due horror. The state must not be an organism dependent on judicial takings."

comment,14259996,,,1493844982,,reasonattlm,"It isn&#x27;t news to the audience I usually talk to that the California Life Company, or Calico for short, Google&#x27;s venture into aging research, is secretive. Outside of the staff, few people can do more than read the tea leaves regarding what exactly they are up to. The high level summary is that Google is channeling a large amount of funding into some sort of long-term development plan for therapeutics to treat aging as a medical condition. Over the past few years Calico has made sizable development deals with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and hired some of the most noteworthy names in the aging research community. It is usual for biotechnology and drug development companies to be fairly secretive in their early stages, for reasons that largely relate to investment regulations. At some point they have to talk about what they are doing, however, given that the goal is clinical trials, customers, and revenue.<p>It may be the case that Calico is simply following the standard biotechnology startup game plan over a longer time frame and with more funding than is usually the case, including the secrecy portion of that plan, but by now most of those interested in faster progress and beneficial upheaval in the research community have written off Calico as a venture unlikely to make any meaningful difference [1] [2]. Given who has been hired to lead it, and given the deals made, the most likely scenario is that Calico is the second coming of the Ellison Medical Foundation. By that I mean an organization that is essentially running more of the same research funded at the National Institute on Aging, with a poor or absent focus on clinical translation, and constrained in goals to the paradigm of drug development to slightly slow the progression of aging. In this area you will find things like calorie restriction mimetics, pharmaceutical enhancement of autophagy, and so forth. The past twenty years of research have made it clear that it is very hard and very expensive to produce even marginally effective and reliable drugs capable of slowing aging through the adjustment of metabolic processes. Yet this is exactly what most research groups continue to try.<p>There is an alternative approach. Instead of altering the poorly understood intersection between metabolism and aging in an attempt to slow the damage of aging, instead periodically repair the quite well cataloged list of fundamental cell and tissue damage that causes aging. This approach is exemplified by senescent cell clearance - a way to extend healthy life and turn back symptoms of aging and age-related disease that is already showing itself more robust and useful than any of the present drug candidates aimed at altering the operation of metabolism to slow aging. Senescent cell clearance as a way to reverse aging has been pushed by the SENS rejuvenation research advocates for more than 15 years [3], with good evidence as support. Yet over that span of time the majority of the research community rejected damage repair in favor of focusing on efforts to slow aging, efforts that have not succeeded in producing useful therapeutics with sizable results on human health.<p>That rejection was clearly not sound. Once efforts started in earnest on development of methods of senescent cell clearance, it required only the past few years to robustly demonstrate its effectiveness as a rejuvenation therapy [4]. It is gathering ever more attention now - but not from Calico, so far as we know, and not from the majority of the research community that continues to work on slowing aging through adjustment of metabolism, an approach to aging as a medical condition that is demonstrably marginal and expensive. The funding used to bring senescent cell clearance up to its present point of proven success is a tiny fraction of what has been spent on so far futile efforts to produce calorie restriction mimetic drugs [5] that would, even if realized, be far less effective and far less useful to patients.<p>On the whole I think Calico is most likely a larger than usual example of the primary problem in aging research: the dominance of initiatives that put their funds towards complex, lengthy, and uncertain projects that even in the best of circumstances are only capable of producing poor outcomes for patients. In short, the problem is an unwillingness to pursue the repair and rejuvenation approach that is demonstrably more effective than the adjusting metabolism to slow aging approach. Excessive secrecy is a minor quibble in comparison.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;603087&#x2F;googles-long-strange-life-span-trip&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;603087&#x2F;googles-long-stran...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mendelspod.com&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;brian-kennedy-and-aubrey-de-grey-their-converging-approaches-aging-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mendelspod.com&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;brian-kennedy-and-aubrey-de-g...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sens.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sens.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;introduction-to-sens-research</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dx.doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;nature16932"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dx.doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;nature16932</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2008&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;720_million_worth_of_sirtuin_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2008&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;720...</a>"

comment,14259966,,,1493844842,,jerf,"&quot;it change the equilibrium for future generations of lenders and borrowers such that an inefficiently low amount of lending goes on?&quot;<p>Well, one of the questions is whether the modern definition of &quot;efficient amount of lending&quot; is in fact the correct value. If we&#x27;re undervaluing the risk of a fat tail of defaults, and worse, correlated defaults, then the true &quot;efficient amount of lending&quot; may in fact be less than it is today, even much less.<p>Ten years ago, I could have said that if you looked around, it seemed like a there were an awful lot of entities carrying debt loads that they couldn&#x27;t possible discharge and default seemed inevitable. Of course, I would have been poopooed and had the claim dismissed because, basically, &quot;debt is good for the economy&quot;. Now we live in a world where at least some of those debts have indeed caused catastrophe; Greece is still reeling, the stresses that financial crisis put on the EU are still echoing, Puerto Rico is now declaring bankruptcy, and the &quot;financial crisis&quot; that we have still really not &quot;recovered&quot; from was 100% driven by debt and the slicing and dicing thereto. In light of that, take another fresh look around at the sheer staggering number of entities in massive and probably unsustainable amounts of debt right now, and in light of the fact that it is clearly not impossible for them to default after all... what happens next?<p>Furthermore, this sort of implicitly presumes that &quot;lending&quot; is the only possible method for attaining the goals, but there are other possibilities, such as selling equity stakes. Selling equity stakes are not equivalent to lending, which indeed is part of the point, and fully exploring the second-order consequences would be on the order of a PhD thesis or beyond, but at least equity-based systems don&#x27;t have the catastrophic collapse that debt-based systems do due to the lack of leverage. In an equity system, an entity can lose its shirt, but if it does, that&#x27;s that and it&#x27;s all done. In a debt-based system, an entity can lose <i>more</i> than its shirt.<p>And, you know, human society has discovered more than once that debt-based systems are attractive nuisances where the long-term dangers strongly outweigh the short-term gains. I hesitate to directly apply the lessons of the past because a lot of things have changed about the financial world in the last hundred years... but that doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the modern world won&#x27;t in fact dig itself in <i>even deeper</i> than any of the ancient civilizations did, with much greater skill, and consuming all the slack in the system before the collapse far more effectively than the ancient world could ever have dreamed of."

In the various referendums, the majority generally goes for status quo, followed by statehood, followed by independence. In 2012, the referendum was more or less connived to produce a vote for statehood (it was structured as two questions, the first &quot;status quo or not&quot; and the second &quot;state, free association, or complete independence&quot;). There&#x27;s apparently another referendum scheduled in a month, but I&#x27;ve not found any polling on what the likelihood of success for statehood is in that referendum."

Was there any need for such divisiveness?  What did they hope to gain?<p>The special interest groups will move into Facebook. They will shut down anything they don&#x27;t like and allow everything (no matter how intolerant) that aligns with their political agenda.  Use &quot;domestic violence&quot; as an example by searching that term at Google. Almost all publications ignore worldwide government stats that show huge numbers of female perpetrators.  Almost all media outlets say domestic violence is something only males do and only females are victims of, in spite of overwhelming evidence this is false.  That&#x27;s an example of non neutrality by a special interest group.  It&#x27;s lead to a starvation of funding and support for one sex. It&#x27;s lead to animosity.<p>Do you think Facebook will be impartial in their moderation?  The special interest groups will apply extreme pressure and the result will be extreme views."
comment,14259846,,,1493844000,,geofft,"Thank you! I think this analysis is simplistic and has a lot of room for questions, but it is an analysis and it is data-supported, and I respect that. (And I don&#x27;t think that citing these facts is sexist in any way.)<p>One line of argument occurs to me: my understanding is that the breakdown of incoming freshmen at top colleges (by which I mean the sorts of colleges Facebook tries very hard to recruit from) is very gender-balanced, much more so than would be implied by the normal distributions you cite. This raises two questions:<p>1. Are these colleges selecting students for some reason other than general intelligence (whether this is &quot;political correctness&quot; or &quot;intelligence isn&#x27;t everything&quot; is irrelevant to this question), and if so, can we measure the IQ of men and women at these colleges and find a significant difference? Even if men and women <i>as a whole</i> have different IQ distributions, I would initially assume men and women <i>at top colleges</i> to have comparable IQ distributions (because that&#x27;s what college admissions should select for), but I can believe that this is not true.<p>2. How much is raw general intelligence useful for software engineering compared to the pedigree of having attended one of these top schools? I would assume that being in the 95th percentile of intelligence and having a degree from one of these schools is more likely to lead to success than being in the 98th percentile and not, but, again, I can very easily be convinced otherwise."

I remember searching going backwards from the time that we introduced the changeset concept, there either 6 or 9 hits in over 2 decades of Usenet posts.

Perhaps this is a result of too many irons in the fire - he&#x27;s also a historian and graphic arts - but it has a good deal to do with his being a recluse and his relatively humble social origins, in my view, which perspective is fundamental to his writing.

comment,14259711,,,1493843157,,jononor,"Re &#x27;factory worker&#x27;. When I studied, I worked part-time in a shop selling bicycles. One of my main tasks was assembling &amp; tuning the bicycles (they come flatpacked). I recall that on my first day (as a 14 year old with no prior experience), I could only complete one bike, with another one in progress. The teaching was mostly &#x27;here are the tools, tell us when done&#x2F;stuck&#x27;. A couple years, maybe 1000 hours of experience later, I would average around 3 bikes per hour. So, a factor 12-15 speedup.
This was basically as fast as the guys who had been doing it 20-30 years full-time. I stayed basically at that level until I stopped at 6 years. Note, this was no sweatshop, just a pretty active and successful self-owned store.<p>It is possible that those that assemble Ikea furniture for a living have 10x over a typical Ikea-buyer."

comment,14259702,,,1493843042,,CWuestefeld,"I&#x27;d have said the opposite - that Thomas et al are closer to getting it right (although nobody seems to quite get all the way).<p>I&#x27;m guessing that you&#x27;re not making any distinction between negative rights (which is what the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Constitution deal with) versus the more modern idea of positive right.<p>Negative rights are those where the government is constrained from interfering with you; freedom of speech and the right to keep and bear arms are obvious examples of this.<p>Positive rights are those where we say that a person has an right to GET a thing, and so the government must be obligated to provide it. The Constitution does <i>not</i> guarantee any of this [1].<p>In that context, it seems correct to view 9A as saying that there exist additional unenumerated <i>negative</i> rights. But trying to do so with positive rights eventually gets into trouble, because there&#x27;s no clear ceiling on <i>how much</i> of something is due to each person.<p>So for example, there&#x27;s a thing going around Facebook with Jimmy Kimmel about healthcare, which has everyone saying that no one should never need to consider finances when their child is sick. This is plainly false in the general case, because it would imply infinite resources. In the real world, there will always be a point at which we must say &quot;no more&quot;.<p>IMHO, given that the Constitution was written in the context of the Enlightenment idea of negative rights, and positive rights hadn&#x27;t been part of the discussion; together with the fact that the limits of positive rights are thus left completely undefined, I&#x27;m quite OK with the Court deciding to keep a tight leash on that.<p>[1] Although I suppose the right to an attorney when accused is kinda fuzzy. But it doesn&#x27;t suffer from the problem of open-ended obligations that I discuss later."

You say «Email notifications can sometimes ruin your focus and hamper your creativity», but I would say the best way to stay focused is to consult mails only when decided.<p>&gt; 1. Which Emails are important and need a reply<p>Google Inbox is really smart and knows how to classify mails by category without any training (Travel, Shopping, Finance, Social Network, Notifications, Forums, Promotion), and for each category you can choose if A) you want to get notifications when you receive them, and B) If they should be shown grouped in the inbox. Nowadays, if I get a notification for a mail, it means that the mail is of interest. I don&#x27;t receive anymore notifications for forums answers, promotions mails or notifications, neither on my computer nor my phone.<p>&gt; 2. Which sent Emails require follow ups and what is the best time for a follow up.<p>Google Inbox let you use your inbox as a TODO list, where you can mark mails (or groups, as above) as done, which has the same effect has archiving it. Aside the &quot;mark as done&quot; feature, there is also a &quot;snooze until&quot; feature that let you in one click snooze the mail (hide it from inbox) until Tomorrow, This weekend, Next week, a given date, or even a place (looks awesome, I never saw it actually). You can also &quot;pin&quot; mails so they stay on top of your inbox.<p>&gt; 3. Which contacts are important to you and which ones are drifting away and need to be reconnected with<p>I don&#x27;t need this feature from my inbox, but maybe some people do.<p>So for me Google Inbox mostly solves the same problems, except it is free and you get all bonus points from using Google: Automatically detecting flights and travels mails, showing these info directly in the inbox, easy visualization of mail attachments, Android application of Google Inbox, etc. I don&#x27;t know if you already tried Google Inbox, but if not you should, it is important to know your main concurrent.<p>My goal is not to be rude, I&#x27;m trying to help you by showing that Google Inbox solves already most of your problems, and people using it will notice that, whatever ways you turn your arguments. Maybe you should direct your arguments more on the «same features as Google, but without Google» side? Some people have concern about Google having all their data, it may be working, but this is just some thoughts that may be helping you. I wish you good luck for your project, I hope you will make it succeed :-)"

comment,14259492,,,1493841801,,anigbrowl,"I&#x27;m aware of those factors, but there&#x27;s a balancing of legitimate interests. I disagree with your notion of active harm because the degree of self-censorship I engage is my choice.<p>Suppose I wish to immanentize the eschaton, and step one of this plan is the overthrow of the United States&#x27; government. Obviously the government as an entity has an interest in not being overthrown, so if I announce that goal and try to recruit people to it it&#x27;s going to watch me increasingly closely in proportion to the degree of my activism.<p>Well, you say, doesn&#x27;t that have a chilling effect? Maybe. it depends very much on the nature of my eschatology.<p>Perhaps I am a very peaceful person and my brilliant plan is to persuade everyone who wants to to meditate for 15 minutes a day at noon, thereby raising everyone&#x27;s consciousness so effectively that everyone behaves angelically and the need for government evaporates. Unlikely, but fundamentally harmless. You&#x27;re going to have a hard time finding any jury that will convict me for suggesting that people sit still and calm their thoughts for a few minutes every day, but only if they feel like it.<p>Suppose on the other hand that I&#x27;m a miserable old bastard and my plan is to build an army, storm every state capitol, kill 2&#x2F;3 of the population, and then rule with an iron fist while bathing in the blood of virgins every day of the week, and that I have a cadre of trusted lieutenants and a vast trove of resources to get my project off the ground. Most people would prefer not to participate for reasons that I hope are obvious, and so operational security dictates that I be very covert indeed.<p>Obviously, the bulk of political activity takes place in the center between these similarly unlikely extremes. Equally obviously, extremism exists and some of that extremism manifests as threats rather than opportunities. It is, inarguably, the government&#x27;s job to protect people from reasonably foreseeable threats, and gathering information on the environment is an unavoidable necessity in the pursuit of that end.<p>I don&#x27;t feel my liberty to be compromised by this, primarily because I have no plans to extralegally reduce anyone else&#x27;s liberties. Is it possible that corrupt individuals, factions, or whole institutions within government might recognize that I am a peaceable person, but decide to make my life miserable anyway? Yes, of course it is.<p>But that is a risk I must accept as it is a basic problem of human relations. My personal philosophy on such matters is basically a Stoic one, that I am primarily accountable to myself, and even if my liberty or life should be threatened by others, what maters above all else is my relationship with my own conscience. There is no way to legislate moral goodness; people can observe the letter of the law but still have evil intentions towards others and even act upon those (indeed I&#x27;d say that describes how a large part of the USA functions right now).<p>Adding more laws to constrain government from doing things that <i>might</i> be used for evil is not the answer. First, such laws are easily circumvented. Second, laws are easily suspended, by fiat or by consensus, in times of emergency, and the belief that they won&#x27;t be is facile. Third, such laws would impinge upon legitimate actions taken in pursuit of legitimate objectives, ie the detection of threats. Fourth, given the existence of other powerful nations with powerful intelligence-gathering capabilities, for a country&#x27;s government to put itself at an informational disadvantage relative to others is to put the citizenry at a strategic disadvantage, which is to endanger them, which irresponsible given government&#x27;s obligation to protect.<p>It&#x27;s foolish to only consider one side of an argument or to only prosecute one&#x27;s own interests. Natural, but foolish. I think policing is badly corrupted in many jurisdictions, but a policing power is an essential role of government that has been instituted because it works better than the alternative. I loathe war and militarism, but a country that dismantles its armed forces in the name of peace makes itself vulnerable to invasion by less altruistic nations, to the detriment of its residents. I don&#x27;t enjoy fighting, but I am good at it and will defend myself if someone attacks me rather than allowing them to use me as a punching bag. Likewise, I come to the aid of others if I happen upon a situation where I see another being abused.<p>No offense, but I think the notion that governments should refrain from any sort of pre-emptive intelligence collection is ridiculous, and I would no more support it than I would walk around an unfamiliar neighborhood with blinkers on to avoid seeing anything that might upset me. I feel that your and others&#x27; insistence that government abstain from any sort of intelligence gathering is equivalent to trying to solve health problems through prayer, or trying to prevent unwanted pregnancy and venereal disease by telling people not to have sex. It&#x27;s neither practical nor sensible. Just as adulthood involves making complex and often unpleasant decisions about one&#x27;s person and relations with other persons, citizenship requires making complex and difficult decisions about the pragmatic balance between orthogonal legitimate interests."

comment,14259486,,,1493841758,,openasocket,"I don&#x27;t think cryptocurrency helps. When we&#x27;re talking about regulation, we&#x27;re talking about tax and tax evasion, right? They don&#x27;t need to be able to trace the source and destination of all financial transactions. They just need to notice the guy who&#x27;s reporting to the IRS he&#x27;s working at minimum wage is driving around in a brand new sports car. Which is the sort of thing that will show up during a random audit. So the problem with using cryptocurrency for unregulated or illicit things is the same for cash: you need to launder your money. So you make a small business that sells stuff using a cryptocurrency, and inflate the profits with your dirty cryptocurrency. But then during an audit you have to show your reported income is legitimate, with proper sales receipts and such. And then we&#x27;ve entered the exciting, fast-paced world of forensic accounting! It&#x27;s all pretty much the same story as a cash-based business."

I&#x27;ve never heard of someone needing a Facebook account for credit and any employer asking for your Facebook profile is a huge red flag.<p>Here[1]. Saying &quot;wasted&quot; as a status update can affect a credit score. And even if it isn&#x27;t disclosed, employers, and other entities, may use your Facebook activity. This is a totally valid issue. So, yes, Facebook does matter, whether you like it to or not. It isn&#x27;t just a toy, and you can&#x27;t just stop using it, without it potentially harming you. I think it&#x27;s totally unfair, but people now have to consider their online presence when hunting for a job.<p>And they don&#x27;t have to ask for your Facebook account specifically. Companies like ru4.com can tie your financial identity to your social media identity[2].

Sometimes locking the health value will freeze a game though as developers use a cheap refill animation on leveling up or beating a boss, and you end up with the animation getting stuck as the emulator keeps resetting the value.<p>I have never owned one, but i think gamesharks and others work similarly."

comment,14259339,,,1493840778,,khedoros1,"Maybe it&#x27;s more like the weirder people are pushed away from things they find awkward. They&#x27;re pushed to the easiest alternative. Social cues come into play; males are cued that technology is acceptable for them, females are cued that it isn&#x27;t. More transgendered people than cisgendered people may not identify with those gender-based social cues, and disregard them.<p>What are those social cues? I don&#x27;t know, in general. In my case, my father used the computer much more than my mother did. He built and maintained it. &quot;Computer people&quot; in the late 80s and early 90s were almost all male. My grandfather taught me, but not my sister, about electronics and soldering. My sister certainly played computer and video games, but not nearly as much as me or my brother."

comment,14259303,,,1493840497,,drostie,"To be a bit playful, there is a sort of &quot;Magic: the Gathering&quot; version of this dissent, if it helps people.<p>So a Conviction is basically a type of enchantment which says you have 3 fewer life points and trouble getting a job. Now someone managed to cast Reverse Conviction, which exiles one conviction -- it&#x27;s not even in the graveyard, as much as legally possible it&#x27;s like it never happened, with the only exception being double-jeopardy laws etc. And the question is whether you get those life points back.<p>According to the majority opinion, having your life points converted into tokens on the State Government card was <i>part of the ongoing enchantment</i>, and so this ended when the enchantment ended: they should be converted back.<p>According to Clarence Thomas, it was an <i>instant effect</i> that happened when the enchantment was cast, and the ongoing effects were the other parts of the enchantment. So when it was cast, <i>that</i> was the time when you were &quot;deprived&quot; of your life points; it&#x27;s not an &quot;ongoing deprivation&quot; but a single event which happened in time. You don&#x27;t get them back unless another card in play says you do.<p>(A more full analogy would also include the fact that there is this Exoneration Act card which says &quot;(3) Take a conviction token from the State Government and gain a life point. You may not do this if there is an enchantment which creates these tokens either on you or in the graveyard,&quot; and a house rule called Due Process which says that you cannot be deprived of life points without some card in the field of play saying so. )"

comment,14259123,,,1493839178,,anigbrowl,"Edit: forgot to say that no, this won&#x27;t have a direct bearing on civil asset forfeiture of the kind you describe, because that only takes place where the identity of the property owner is unknown. The result in terms of not allowing the state to take money from people whose criminal convictions are overturned is great though.<p>--<p>The idea is not asinine, it&#x27;s perfectly rational.<p>Cops do a drug bust and all the criminals flee. (I&#x27;m personally opposed to drug prohibition but it&#x27;s the law and the easiest example so I&#x27;m going with that for simplicity&#x27;s sake.)<p>At the scene: 3 bricks of cocaine and $1m dollars. Cocaine is contraband so the cops don&#x27;t need permission to take it, they can just help themselves to a few fat rails and then throw the rest in a furnace, resell it, or whatever.<p>What about the million bucks? It&#x27;s property. there might even be a legitimate reason for it to be there (eg suppose it had just been stolen from a bank but the cops had yet to connect the bank robbery with the drug deal). The cops can&#x27;t just take it, because if that was allowed then cops could just help themselves to any property they see and how would people ever know what happened to it? OK, so there must be some sort of process to document their taking possession of it until said possession is successfully challenged. That&#x27;s a court&#x27;s job.<p>On one side, the state entity that employs the cops. On the other...who? The (presumed) drug dealers fled so it&#x27;s not obvious who the other side of the case should be. American law is built from the ground up around adversarial argument between parties with conflicting interests, so for administrative convenience we&#x27;d like to have the case be &#x27;Someone v. someone else&#x27; like every other legal case. If we don&#x27;t know who, let&#x27;s treat the unclaimed property as its own entity until someone says different. Hence &#x27;State of Jurisdiction v. $1 million.&#x27;<p>Practically speaking, this works fine most of the time. If you keep up with legal case news, in any port city you&#x27;ll see a lot of cases like &#x27;US Customs v. 1000 leather handbags&#x27; - sometimes because the handbags in question are knockoffs, sometimes because the paperwork got lost and a shipment ended up in the wrong place, to be later claimed by the rightful owner with documentation.<p>Asset seizure by police has been abused to hell and back, and I have no hesitation in saying that many police officers and institutions are corrupt. But the legal mechanism for classifying abandoned property is not the problem. That&#x27;s a purely administrative convenience that is entirely neutral in nature. If you didn&#x27;t have it, then cops would just label the money as &#x27;evidence&#x27;, it would disappear, and the problem would be worse because there wouldn&#x27;t even be a paper trail to follow."

I hear the suburbs are OK, but that doesn&#x27;t exactly make me want to live someplace.<p>Basically, AFAICT, Detroit sounds like someplace that would be OK if all you wanted was to live in the suburbs and never leave your house, and you have zero interest in outdoor activities, and don&#x27;t care about going to nice restaurants downtown.  The crime downtown is terrible, there&#x27;s huge stretches of abandoned neighborhoods, the winters are horribly cold; I honestly don&#x27;t know why anyone would want to live there.  The location surely made sense a century ago back when shipping on the Great Lakes was a big thing and the location was sensible for manufacturing and shipping reasons, but those reasons are all gone now."

His Heidegger class was also great, and there he also introduced us to Maurice Merleau-Ponty. I loved his lectures and he was also a nice guy... a lot nicer and more approachable than his also famous colleague John Searle."

For example, if you don&#x27;t approve or deny within a few seconds, I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the transaction times out.<p>This would be fine for in-person transactions, where you can approve it on your phone, but for transactions you aren&#x27;t expecting (e.g. recurring monthly subscriptions) it seems like you&#x27;d need some notice -- or a long timeout period."

Automatically distribute paychecks or other income into different accounts (some to retirement, some to savings, some to checking, w&#x2F;e...); this behavior could change based on the current distribution of your money too, so if your &quot;emergency fund&quot; got really low you could automatically spend more of your income replenishing it.<p>3. Deny unwanted transactions and tightly control your own fraud detection (SMS confirmation for every purchase out of your zip code, confirmations for purchases from new places, you name it...).<p>4. Automate the creation and destruction of virtual cards to minimize danger of online purchases or to make sure that &quot;free trial&quot; never starts charging you.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s tons of other awesome ideas, but I want <i>all</i> of these quite badly."

In my experience, the only way to get any sort of legs out of a high-end purchase is to buy the top of the line. Unless you&#x27;re buying right before a major product release, my experience has been that you end up spending less year over year than if you try to commoditize.<p>But I took the person I was replying to to be asking about getting in as a developer, considering the blog post is about getting in as a developer, and considering this site is full of developers. $2000 has been very consistently the price one pays for &quot;top of the line PC with parts that aren&#x27;t going to shit the bed&quot;. You should not cheap out on a development PC for VR. You&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of experimenting and running up against performance limits during development. You should have some headroom to avoid giving yourself a headache for the day.<p>But go ahead. Buy a Radeon GPU.

If you cannot follow the control flow from your logs, you need to improve your logging, because you will also need to debug production problems that do not produce a literal error object.<p>And if you want more causality than you can get out of your logging, consider upgrading from logging to tracing. I contribute to <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentracing.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentracing.io</a> so naturally that’s the tracing API I would suggest you look at.<p>2. Do not do anything with panics except recover from them or exit.<p>If you have a panic that you cannot recover from (and in general, that should be all of them), then it means your application is in a unknowable state. While Go is not as unsafe as C, any and all state in your program could be bad, and it is completely unclear what is still working and what is not. Nothing you do at this point is safe. For the love of god, do not hang your application and prevent it from exiting by trying to send a Slack message.  Your goal should be to restart your program from a fresh clean state as quickly as possible, not to tie it up on the way out. Let the program exit and have an external monitoring program, whose state is NOT corrupted because its in a separate process, do all of the triage and reporting."

I think if you looked at the time and money spent in mobile headsets vs heavyweight systems it would tell a different story than sales figures. Better to make a few people love you then lots of people just sorta like you, and all that YC jazz.<p>2. I&#x27;m extremely susceptible to motion sickness and I&#x27;ve been trying most of the latest content so I think I&#x27;m a good canary to see if VR actually makes you sick anymore. I do think there are some perception problems that are lingering around longer than I thought they would, and this is a consumer awareness problem that as you say, will take some time to solve. Luckily I think its largely a moot point because everybody that tries good content realizes that it doesn&#x27;t always make you sick and that they need to have one as soon as they can afford it.<p>3. I bet every future Oculus Rift and Vive generation will be lighter than they are today. Making a bet that a piece of consumer technology will get heavier and larger as time increases is generally an ill-advised move."

comment,14258694,,,1493836325,,throwawayind1,"Warning - rant ahead.<p>Aadhar is expensive, intrusive and ultimately futile for the stated objectives. 
More than $1.5B have been spent on it with more being allocated every budget. For context Mangalyan&#x27;s budget was $74M.
I haven&#x27;t been able to find how much it has helped save. There is no cost&#x2F;benefit analysis.<p>It was started as a way to ensure proper delivery of subsidised services to the poor, it has since enhanced its scope
to encompass <i>all</i> government services. One needs it for 
1) getting a sim card, 
2) filing tax returns
3) train journey(for seniors but won&#x27;t be surprised if it soon becomes mandatory for everyone)
4) school admissions - really kids cannot be enrolled in school without Aadhar<p>with proposals to use the biometrics for 
5) domestic air travel
6) biometric enabled POS
7) replace debit&#x2F;credit cards<p>Somehow this will magically solve all our problems and make us a developed nation by virtue of
using a biometric enabled digital tracking service.<p>For a nation of bilion people, even a faboulous error rate of 0.01% will affect 10M people.
People responsible for it claim it is <i>secure</i> and <i>hackproof</i>. I am having a hard time trying to decipher if this is ignorance, incompetence or malice or all three mixed in.<p>The current goverment is drunk on power. Obvious comparisons  with previous dictatorial regimes gets laughed at.
But the signs are there to see - rampant sycophancy to the PM, increased social intolerance, conflict escalation in&#x2F;with Kashmir&#x2F;Pakistan, arbitrary decisions like demonetization, moving the financial year to Jan-Dec.<p>For a supposedly non-corrupt government, the sly introduction of clause to remove cap on corporate donations
to political parties in the Finance bill is blatant hypocrisy to say the least.<p>For anyone who thinks demonetization was good, just review the government narrative on why it was needed.
First it was black money, then terrorist funding&#x2F;fake notes, then digitization. The very people who lost their 
businesses&#x2F;livelihood due to demonetization support the PM and think it was good. When asked why, no idea. Ignorance is strength.<p>Almost all modern governments are guilty to some extent, but this government has totally embraced the INGSOC principles and has mastered the art of doublethink.
And the scary thing is, they have succeeded at it. People just dismiss the privacy and surveillance implications of Aadhar as hypothetical scenarios.<p>Anybody who criticizes the government is unpatriotic and a traitor."

comment,14258619,,,1493835941,,smacktoward,"I&#x27;m not a VR developer, but from an outside perspective it actually looks like there are a few different crises.<p>1) <i>Developers</i> seem to be interested in heavyweight VR systems like Vive and Rift, while <i>users</i> (based on sales figures, anyway) seem to be interested in inexpensive, cordless systems like GearVR and Cardboard. Which leads to the awkward situation where all the innovative software is coming out for hardware that very few users actually own. (And then that market gets segmented even further -- with Rift development now orienting around Rift + Touch, for instance, which leaves users without Touch behind.)<p>2) &quot;It hasn&#x27;t made <i>me</i> sick in over a year!&quot; is not an answer to concerns about VR making people sick that is going to get people to rush out and buy hardware. Once a product has developed a rep for making people sick (not <i>everybody</i>, of course, but all it takes is <i>enough</i> people), it can take a long, long time to shake that rep off.<p>3) There&#x27;s a fundamental problem that nobody in this generation of VR has been able to really solve yet, which is <i>making a headset that is comfortable to wear for long periods.</i> Even simpler solutions like GearVR are heavy enough that you feel their weight after wearing them for 30 minutes or more, and with developers pushing the platform towards bigger&#x2F;deeper experiences, the trend in hardware doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll be running primarily towards weight reduction. This could lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of pushing the tech further and further away from a mass audience, as VR enthusiasts (i.e. people who don&#x27;t mind the weight of existing hardware) demand higher-resolution experiences, which leads to hardware companies pursuing more power instead of less weight, which leads to products that only sell to VR enthusiasts, who demand higher-resolution experiences, etc. Something similar to this happened to the market for flight simulations in the &#x27;90s, which resulted in one of the main categories of entertainment software evolving into a tiny niche market of interest only to obsessives.<p>None of which is to say that VR is doomed, or that these things are in reality as serious as they appear to be to an outsider. But I would say there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical that VR will become a big, mass-market hit, at least this go-around."

comment,14258571,,,1493835655,,ianbicking,"A long time ago there was a theory about using Guile (the GNU Scheme) as a general interpreter for languages using partial evaluation: you write an interpreter for a language in Scheme, use a given program as input, and run an optimizer over the program.  This turns your interpreter into a compiler.  I played around with the concept (making a Tcl interpreter), and it even kind of worked, often creating reasonably readable output.<p>Prepack looks like the same kind of optimizer – it could be a fun task to write an interpreter and see if this can turn it into a compiler&#x2F;transpiler."

Please email resumes to hiring@alar.net
We are looking for experienced Scala back-end-focused engineers to help design and build out our SaaS product for trucking companies. We’re taking logistics data from various real-time sources to enable our customers to increase efficiency and provide lead generation by connecting them with other trucking companies. We’re onto something big but to get there we’re working through complex problems in a complex and often old-fashioned problem domain. We’re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.
BACK-END POSITION
This isn’t a run-of-the-mill MVC app and requires solving performance and scalability problems in distributed systems using data combined from many sources, several of which are real-time sources including GPS data. Because of this complexity, we&#x27;re limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow or those who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don&#x27;t apply unless you can demonstrate one, if not both, of these.
Back-end stack: Our product is built on Scala, Postgresql, Event Sourcing using Apache Beam atop Google Data Flow, Akka, and the Scala Play framework. Our front-end is predominantly AngularJS."

comment,14258493,,,1493835189,,hwillis,"&gt;The above claim is exactly what made me skeptical: the greater availability of something reduces its price, so 50% of the price of a new one just doesn&#x27;t sound right, unless there&#x27;s some identified other immense need for them: the number of &quot;used&quot; batteries available to the market would be huge if the number of the buyers of the electric cars would significantly increase.<p>On the one hand there is something to your intuition: 50% is a near-maximum price that basically assumes people will be buying batteries for the grid&#x2F;home.  This could be for solar, or people could want stationary batteries at home to keep a quick top-up charge for their car.  Alternately companies could buy extra batteries to top up their electric fleet, or to supplement solar, or to take advantage of off-peak demand.<p>On the other hand the actual resale price is basically irrelevant.  The scrap price of a car is a few hundred dollars, so a battery would have to fall to like 5% of it&#x27;s own value to not be worth recycling.  At that price you wouldn&#x27;t be able to sell the things fast enough.<p>The volume isn&#x27;t a real problem.  There&#x27;s a 20+ year lag time before enough cars are being recycled to make this an issue.  IF used battery supply ever exceeds demand -very unlikely, given the always falling cost of solar- there is pleeeeeenty of time for recycling to start.  The short and long term problems are very different.  The absorption mechanisms that seem insufficient at high volume are a bridge to the recycling that seems immature.<p>&gt;That can only pull down the price of the used ones and increase the price of the new ones. The real question is where the ultimate prices would be, considering these effects.<p>It would pull down the price of used and other secondary batteries.  Normally this would increase the price of a new commodity, but batteries are supply-constrained and their price is set by the number we can make.  It would <i>also</i> pull down the price of new batteries, since they would have fewer buyers at the higher price point.  More likely the lower demand would have no effect at all.<p>&gt;Also, Tesla claims that their lithium batteries last extremely long, that is so if the battery&#x27;s not completely discharged, but every lithium battery in every notebook I have had was the first to die or degrade very fast, even if I surely never &quot;deep&quot; discharged it. And it&#x27;s so small compared to the ones in the car. So there is some significant difference somewhere between what&#x27;s claimed and what I&#x27;ve personally experienced.<p>I dearly love this stuff, and explaining it (I&#x27;m an electrical engineer).  There are a bunch of reasons for the difference!  The biggest one is actually heat- your laptop gets super hot in use and uses the batteries as a heat sink, but an electric car very carefully cools its battery (unless it&#x27;s a Leaf).  A battery at 60C can drop to 60% of its original capacity after just 3 months.  This kills laptops dead after just a few years even if you keep them plugged in every second you own them.<p>The second biggest is depth of charge.  The average daily drive is around 30 miles, or 10-20% of an electric car&#x27;s battery.  Most trips are just short errands or commutes, not long drives.  You may not deep discharge your laptop, but a battery will do 5,000 cycles if you discharge it to 85%, and 1,000 if you discharge it to 50%.  The best results are with normal discharges under 20%, which nobody does with a laptop but almost every single electric car does.  A &lt;10% DoD will last for tens of thousands of cycles.<p>I really can&#x27;t overstate how dramatic the difference is.  Batteries as we currently use them are <i>very</i> badly mistreated, and when they are kept in &lt;90 F conditions they last 2-3 times longer.  When used lightly they last 3-4x longer.  Both situations happen naturally in a car.  Even in very hot climates the hot days never get anywhere near to the temperatures in a laptop or phone.<p>&gt;And what&#x27;s the market for the used up consumer electronics lithium batteries?<p>Currently more lithium is used to make ceramic glazes than batteries.  Collecting and reselling the hundreds of different kinds of batteries from junked laptops is a healthy, profitable business in Asian countries.  There simply aren&#x27;t enough batteries to warrant real recycling though."

The paradigm battles don&#x27;t have to be: we can run all sorts of paradigms in the same VM, with data executing as code.  This means that you can <i>decompose</i> expressions to see where they came from (e.g. the steps in a state machine that yielded an evaluation result).  If you believe (as I do) that invisibility-by-default is one of the greatest pain points in the history of computing, then these sorts of approaches are essential.<p>The problem with doing that is that some things will be slower than they would in &quot;native&quot; JS.  I&#x27;ve been proceeding anyway and thinking that could be dealt with later.  So I&#x27;m bookmarking this, because it attacks that exact problem: runtime-compilation of generated AST&#x27;s.<p>The name is a little unfortunate, in that respect, though, especially since it will make people think it&#x27;s a build tool like Webpack.  Webpack is for dead fish.  This is incomparably more powerful.<p><i>edit</i> so to answer your original question, this would piggyback on the optimizations of the VM (V8 or SpiderMonkey, or whatever), taking for granted that JS which is not needlessly verbose (as generated code must sometimes be), can be run nearly optimally."

No numbers I can find about data transfer, lifecycle operations, multi-region approaches, data durability, or any of the things that AWS handles for us.<p>I&#x27;m highly skeptical for two reasons. The first is that this stuff is hard, and AWS hasn&#x27;t been particularly gouging people with their pricing model for storage.<p>The second is looking at the historic on-prem storage market. Generally if you didn&#x27;t go with the top 3-5 storage vendors, you could expect your vendor to get acquired by one of them, and then immediately EOL whatever you had bought from them, as a few of their features were integrated into the acquirer&#x27;s offering.<p>We&#x27;ll see how it goes, but storage is one of those areas where I&#x27;m very slow to adopt new technologies or vendors; mistakes here generally show up catastrophically."

comment,14258235,,,1493833723,,cookiecaper,"Yeah, I agree. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m getting at; in the physical world, there is a bright line between &quot;an invention&quot; and &quot;a copy&quot;. You buy a reproduction of an invention, or a physical reproduction of a copyrighted work, and that reproduction is a discrete unit owned by the purchaser and not really subject to the limitations of IP (only insofar as the fundamental components are directly copied to deprive the inventor&#x2F;author of the proceeds).<p>In cyberspace, many things that <i>should</i> be considered &quot;inventions&quot; for IP purposes, and thus subject to the much more limited extent of patent protection and for which each individual unit is an unprotected entity, are instead considered &quot;new copies&quot; of a copyrighted work, under which substantially more aggressive licensing restrictions are typical, and under which the definition of things like &quot;infringement&quot; and &quot;derivative&quot; are much more restrictive.<p>A software program should be an invention under patent law, and its copies should be considered discrete physical units. The code itself may be copyrighted, just as the plans for an invention may be, but the produced binaries probably should not be. Rather, they are units of the invention regulated as normal goods.<p>This has become even harder as we have gone to mostly-digital software distribution. You used to be able to easily resell software if you had a CD. Now you can&#x27;t even do that (which, by the way, is no small motive for the companies; it completely obliterates the secondary market for software).<p>IANAL"

We will draw what we mean when words become difficult. We will riff on those ideas in a real-time simulation. And with the mind-set or combination of services, it may as well be, or could actually become, a physical reality.<p>If you&#x27;ve seen any of his more recent, HTML5-based demos (he has completely switched off of Java) involving visually-oriented, live-programmable environments with physics baked-in, it&#x27;s almost completely targeted at this dream of communication.

comment,14258208,,,1493833584,,sfRattan,"Democracy has become an empty word.<p>It never reflected modern systems of government (neither those that come close to respect for individual liberties nor those that do not) and its adjective form <i>democratic</i> really only refers to the processes of appointing leadership. A better word for the sort of thing happening here in America and (it would seem) in India might be anti-liberal, but then that word has political baggage of its own in the United States, and a similarly distorted meaning. Perhaps &#x27;illiberal-democracy,&#x27; as a liberal democracy implies a republic with at least semi-democratic election to leadership underpinned by a lowest common denominator of shared values: peace as an ideal, individual liberty, some property rights, and an amount of cultural openness or tolerance.<p>In the United States, we&#x27;ve seen Trump rise in the wake of two waves of Republican success in the low turnout midterms of 2010 and 2014 and after even earlier stratagems to control State governments and thereby all the redistricting following the 2010 census (to jam a proverbial foot in the door of every valuable Congressional election until 2020). All very Late-Roman-Republic maneuvering and none of it &#x27;democratic.&#x27;<p>Of course, if we had a more directly democratic system things would likely have been even uglier, independent of who came out on top. When 51% of people get their hands on the power tap, they like how it feels, and not in a good way for the other 49%. Though, I suspect from your comment you might agree. Feel free to snark at me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>&gt; This is what democracy looks like - the enforcement of the will of the majority.<p>Change &#x27;will&#x27; to &#x27;whims&#x27; and we&#x27;re on pretty much the same page. Though what&#x27;s happening in India sounds more like the gradual march of bureaucracy and its exploitation by interested parties rather than a will or even whim of the majority of voters."

comment,14258034,,,1493832638,,jamescostian,"The examples are very far from the JS I see and read, but this is definitely a very useful tool. It seems like gcc -Olevel. It would be interesting to incorporate some sort of tailoring for JS engines into this, like how a compiler might try to make x86-specific optimizations. For example, if you know your target audience mostly runs Chrome (or if the code is to be run by node), you might apply optimizations to change the code to be more performant on V8 (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;petkaantonov&#x2F;bluebird&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Optimization-killers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;petkaantonov&#x2F;bluebird&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Optimization-k...</a> for example).<p>I love it and can&#x27;t wait to use it on some projects!"

comment,14257917,,,1493832047,,malandrew,"I&#x27;m all for measuring discrimination. What I expressed concern with is measuring the <i>perception</i> of discrimination which is fraught with all sorts of biases.<p>In fact, just today there was another front page story today that got flagged that is perfectly demonstrative of this problem:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14252978"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14252978</a><p>The headline is inflammatory and suggests falsely that they&#x27;ve measured something that &quot;objectively&quot; proves discrimination is happening and I&#x27;m sure people shared it and upvoted it based on the title alone because it confirms their biases about discrimination being all-pervasive. However a closer examination of the study shows that <i>once you account for differences in level of the engineer</i> that there is in fact no difference. I see this all the time. Anecdotally, the majority of studies and articles claiming discrimination and using data fall prey to the base rate fallacy and misinterpret the results to show discrimination where none exists or where it it is small enough to not be measurable.<p>I am not disputing that discrimination exists, but it would be prudent to stop crying wolf all the time. In 2017, I have seen remarkably few &quot;smoking guns&quot; relative to the amount of noise we see. What I have seen is an increase in how everything is distorted to maximum effect by people with an agenda to say discrimination is the cause of all the problems."

comment,14257893,,,1493831896,,AnimalMuppet,"OK, I assumed that by &quot;sustain&quot; you meant &quot;subsistence&quot;.  I agree that the capitalist won&#x27;t pay more than needed to retain the worker.<p>&gt; But the worker only works for the capitalist class on pain of death or destitution. If this isn&#x27;t forced, I&#x27;m not sure what is.<p>Well, in the early days of capitalism, when working for the capitalist class had the alternative of staying in subsistence farming, many people chose the factories <i>because it was better than the &quot;freedom&quot; of subsistence farming</i>.  That wasn&#x27;t forced - there was a real alternative at the time, and in fact the alternative was the default.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s still wage labour though...<p>OK, if I wanted to start my own business, I could do that, too.  I&#x27;m still not forced into wage labor.<p>&gt; and you&#x27;re still having your own labour decided its use by someone else. You don&#x27;t have to be your own manager, the point is that you should have free association to choose who you want to work for and what you want to do, rather than a much more limited choice which restricts your true capabilities and creativity to merely what drives profits.<p>Well, I could work on what I wanted, rather than on what drives profits.  That would be really cool.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t take that choice, because I&#x27;d starve - which is your point.  But I would say, <i>why should I be able to?</i>  Sure, it would be nice if the world gave me a living while I do what I want.  But why should I expect it to?  If I want to engage in the economy at all, say as an owner of my own business, I have to care about what people want to buy; I can&#x27;t just do what I want.  Why should I be surprised if it&#x27;s the same when I work for someone else?<p>&gt; Automation usually means that the capitalist has been able to buy machinery which performs the same job with a lower socially necessary labour time than a worker. This means that one or more workers are replaced by such machinery, as the value of their labour is only some fraction of what it was before (going along with Marx&#x27;s theory of value anyway).<p>I think you&#x27;re looking at this backwards.  Look at it from the point of view of the society, not from the point of view of one worker, and think in terms of <i>spending</i> people rather than <i>employing</i> them.<p>Societies used to have one third of their people working on farms.  Now they have maybe 3% of their people working on farms.  That gives an extra 30% of people that can do something else that helps the society.  What do they do?  Well, some of them make the tractors and combines that make it so the society can feed itself with many fewer people, and some make cars and refrigerators and washing machines, and some make computers, and some program them.  The whole society is <i>far</i> better off than it was when a third of the people worked on farms.<p>Now, automation can still be a problem for individual workers, or even for a fairly large number of workers at one time.  Arguably, this is where we are now.  But even with that, I don&#x27;t think that automation is a net loss."

When you&#x27;re not on the same page with what the government does, you retire and let someone else who believes in the solution, implement it and then pay the piper.<p>In Greece, I know of NO politician in 50 years, who retired promptly when his views and gov&#x27;s views stopped being aligned.<p>So regarding Greece, that&#x27;s a huge deal and gives him alone more credibility that the last 10 Greek governments put together."

But it&#x27;s not an ironclad rule, and it shouldn&#x27;t be trotted out as an argument anytime someone tries to improve existing tools. In this case:<p>- I&#x27;d say I need to look up any option flags or commands I use less than 15x&#x2F;week<p>- Even the most professional 10x developer will spend a significant amount of his time with such commands, making this feedback useful<p>- The shell is essentially a REPL, but most people forgo most of its potential because the language isn&#x27;t core to our work, and somewhat hideous.

The homemade camel soup was made from dried camel meat seasoned with a wild herb (maybe some kind of allium-related weed?) the host collected while tending his livestock and packed into jars with salt. (Perhaps it pickled a little?) Another dish at a small restaurant was stir-fried horse meat with garlic shoots.<p>I did eat sheep brains, scooped out of a whole cooked sheep&#x27;s head sawed in half.

So, like, evidence collected generally remains property of the owner, and people can recollect it, but if fines or fees are paid or assets are seized, it assigns the property rights of something to the state, it&#x27;s no longer the individual&#x27;s property and hence they have no right to get it back... even if they were found innocent later of a court case.<p>EDIT: cookiecaper&#x27;s read on it is probably better than mine, go read that."

It starts on page 25 of the PDF.  It is deep in procedure.<p>It ends with the summary:<p><i>No one disputes that if petitioners had never been convicted, Colorado could not have required them to pay the money at issue. And no one disputes that Colorado cannot require petitioners to pay any additional costs, fees, or restitution now that their convictions have been invalidated. It does not follow, however, that petitioners have a property right in the money they paid pursuant to their then-valid convictions, which now belongs to the State and the victims under Colorado law. The Court today announces that petitioners have a right to an automatic refund because the State has “no legal right” to that money. Ante, at 8, n. 11. But, intuitive and rhetorical appeal aside, it does not seriously attempt to ground that conclusion in state or federal law. If petitioners’ supposed right to an automatic refund arises under Colorado law, then the Colorado Supreme Court remains free on remand to clarify whether that right in fact exists. If it arises under substantive due process, then the Court’s procedural due process analysis misses the point.</i><p><i>I respectfully dissent.</i><p>I&#x27;m personally glad it went the way it did, but I&#x27;m really not a law type to figure out if it went that way in a good way."

comment,14257659,,,1493830734,,praneshp,"My wife and I have entered the US twice since President Trump came took charge. We&#x27;re Indians, I&#x27;m on H1b and wife&#x27;s on F1. The second time was a breeze, the agent was in a great mood and we just chatted about how she loves my company&#x27;s product while she did her stuff.<p>The first time was more difficult, because I said something (technically correct) about my documents that confused her (understandably) for a while, so she had to lookup some extra stuff. She also asked my wife a lot of questions, because she was under the (wrong) impression that her school was blacklisted. That was seriously incompetent IMO, but she apologized after her supervisor (or some other superior) explained things to her. She also marked that we needed to go through customs, which the first time I&#x27;ve had to do that in almost 10 entries. I chalked this as a negative experience because of the customs thing, we felt she did that just to inconvenience us in some way. I cannot link this in anyway to President Trump, however.<p>Both times, we were one of the first people to be off the plane&#x27;s economy section, but the wait before we got to the counter was 1+ hour. SFO is ridiculous.<p>My worst experience came when entering during President Obama&#x27;s tenure (but nothing to do with his policy) in 2016. The agent went through my entire 9-year old passport, asked me why I had visited country X in 20YY, why I lied to my visa officer back when I got a F1, etc (that I&#x27;d go back home after studies. I did not lie, I happened to get a job and the employer happened to want to apply for a H1. I did not even know back then that there was a real or fake &quot;shortage&quot; in tech workers).<p>Hopefully more anecdata helps. If you&#x27;re on the fence about visiting the US as a tourist I hope you end up deciding to come!"

It is expensive to ship parts from Hamburg, but because the Mobile workers are not unionized, Airbus can hire fewer of them and pay them lower wages.&quot;<p>I think that&#x27;s the money quote of the article.

If a Medicaid member owns a home and sells it or takes out a second mortgage or comes into money (inheritance, etc.) the government takes a bite right there and then AND kicks the person out of Medicaid because now they have money.<p>I hope you take the time to read the various links I provided and come to understand your situation isn&#x27;t typical and that it is true that Medicaid is not medical insurance.<p>If an insurance company had estate recovery clauses in their insurance policies they would be brought up on fraud charges instantly and most of their management would end-up in jail.

<i>With this ruling the Nelson decision may set an important precedent to rain in another abusive civil proceeding called civil forfeiture. The parallels are striking. Through civil forfeiture, law enforcement can confiscate and keep cash, cars in real estate without securing a criminal conviction or filing charges against the owner. Perversely under civil forfeiture, even those not found guilty in criminal court can still forfeit their property in civil court, since the latter has a lower standard of proof.</i><p>So hopefully they are correct and we&#x27;ll see a reexamination of asset forfeiture sooner than later.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawgonnit.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;02&#x2F;supreme-court-rejects-guilty-until-proven-innocent&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawgonnit.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;02&#x2F;supreme-court-rejects-guilt...</a>"

I&#x27;d suggest you become familiar with Amdahl&#x27;s law<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you are trying to say here. Are you going back to saying computers aren&#x27;t getting faster and then trying to say that moore&#x27;s law is therefore dead when we&#x27;ve already established that it was never about speed?<p>Also what is your point about Amdahl&#x27;s law? I work with lock free concurrency all day every day and if you are trying to say that more cores doesn&#x27;t mean more speed because of Amdahl&#x27;s law, that is pretty shaky ground to say the least. For some reason people seem to assume that if the software they use isn&#x27;t using multiple threads effectively that it must be impossible. This is FAR from the case.  Most programmers don&#x27;t know how to work with concurrency and most software is trapped in legacy architectures that make parallel computations become painful changes.<p>&gt; But Moore&#x27;s law is an enabler of more sophisticated processor architecture.<p>Again, this tangential and not even really true.

What exactly do you think is more difficult about this in node than in other languages or frameworks?  Is there something you would recommend as a better alternative?<p>As much as I like developing in C for fun, it&#x27;s not a good pragmatic choice (unsafe, verbose, you don&#x27;t need direct memory access to build an application like this one).  Nor is bash, unless you think archaic syntax, primitive control flow, and a lack of modern language features are good things.  If you&#x27;d suggest something like Python, it&#x27;s basically exactly the same as node in terms of how high level it is, but (anecdotally) the package ecosystem is much richer in node and npm is easier to use than pip.<p>It&#x27;s almost like people think because JavaScript started in browsers it should stay there and any other use case is somehow wrong or a hack.  But ECMAScript is an open scripting language standard and has absolutely nothing to do with the DOM, or alert()s, or onclicks.<p>I write a lot of Java and C++ for pragmatic, work-related reasons, but if I need to write a command line application quickly I&#x27;ll always come back to node.  It&#x27;s just so damn fast to develop with, and nearly everything I need is one npm install away."

The value of competition and watching someone so much more skilled than you could ever be play a sport at the absolute top-level.<p>I&#x27;m not disabled, transgendered, or anything else. Just a socially awkward red-head who spent most of my elementary and middle school years either embarrassing myself or wishing I wasn&#x27;t so goddamned awkward.<p>In and after high-school, that all changed.

comment,14257455,,,1493829704,,kentonv,"The classes generated by Cap&#x27;n Proto and Protobuf are 100% public and are limited to the exact structures supported by the respective languages. That means that if you decide one day that your state needs to include, say, a queue, or if you want to encapsulate some of your state to give a cleaner API to callers, you can&#x27;t, unless you go all the way and wrap everything. Inevitably if you&#x27;ve been building up your internal APIs in terms of protobuf&#x2F;capnp types all along then you&#x27;re going to be resistant to rewriting it and will instead probably come up with some ugly hack instead, and over time these hacks will pile up.<p>With that said, using protobufs for internal state is not an uncommon practice and if you don&#x27;t care about cleanliness and just want to pound out some code quickly, sometimes it can work well.<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto has an additional disadvantage here in that its zero-copy nature requires arena allocation, in order to make sure all the objects are allocated contiguously so that they can be written out all at once. This actually make allocation memory for Cap&#x27;n Proto object much faster than for native objects -- but you can&#x27;t delete anything except by deleting the entire message. So if you have a data structure that is gradually gaining and losing sub-objects over time, in Cap&#x27;n Proto you&#x27;ll see a memory leak, as the old objects aren&#x27;t freed up. You can work around this by occasionally copying the entire data structure into a new message and deleting the old one -- essentially &quot;garbage collecting&quot;. But it&#x27;s rather inconvenient.<p>This is actually one reason I want to extend the Cap&#x27;n Proto C++ API to generate POCS (Plain Old C Structs) for each type, in addition to the current zero-copy readers&#x2F;builders. You could use the POCS for in-memory state that you mutate over time, then you could dump it into a message when needed (requiring one copy, but it should still be faster than protobuf encoding).<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org&#x2F;roadmap.html#c-capn-proto-api-features"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org&#x2F;roadmap.html#c-capn-proto-api-features</a>"

comment,14257341,,,1493829104,,csours,"A more pertinent question is: What can be automated in a cost effective manner?<p>People from outside manufacturing look at automation like it&#x27;s a holy grail - and it can be in some applications - but it has to make sense.<p>Step 1 of the evaluation would be to look at how much it costs to have a human do those operations now. This should be relatively easy.<p>Step 2 would evaluate what process changes are needed to enable robots to perform the operations. A robot cannot handle the material to be assembled in the same way a human can, so often a human (or other automated system) &quot;stages&quot; material for a robot. Robots do not work well on moving pieces, so you may have to stop other operations for the robot, impacting efficiency. Robotic vision systems need to be set up and debugged, unlike human vision systems (which have typically had 20 years or so of self-programming)<p>For automation to work well, the whole process chain has to be designed for automation.<p>Step 3 would look at the raw cost of robotic components and programming, which is relatively easy.<p>Step 4 would then evaluate the value add per operation of the robotic system.<p>All in all, humans make excellent robots most of the time, as they come with Two Six-Axis arms with multi-articulated effectors (hands), and a sophisticated 3D vision system. Humans have an on-board, self-sustaining power system, and are very mobile. Some humans are even self-diagnosing and self-improving!<p>Try a Human Today!"

Just because they billed $250,000 doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what it cost or even that they ever expected to actually receive $250,000.<p>Besides, apparently the goal of universal healthcare was to allow everybody to still receive the &quot;$250,000&quot; cancer treatment that they were getting before universal healthcare.  This suggests that both with and without universal healthcare, the cancer treatment was being provided, so not having universal healthcare did not actually create another cost.<p>This isn&#x27;t trivial nitpicking: the ACA was sold as something that would reduce costs.  This was mostly false.  The real aim of the ACA was to raid the pockets of more people.  Before, there was a &quot;$250,000 cancer treatment&quot; and the insured paid for it with a &quot;$17 ibuprofen.&quot;  The true objective of the ACA was to keep the &quot;$250,000 cancer treatment&quot; but instead pay for it by raiding the pockets of young, healthy people who previously did not have insurance.<p>It turns out that raiding the pockets of young, healthy people is not so politically popular.  They didn&#x27;t have insurance for a reason--it&#x27;s expensive!  Their unemployment and student debt is already high, and they already have to pay for old people through Social Security and Medicare tax.  Yet the ACA wanted to use those young people, who would pay premiums, use little health care, and thus help pay for more &quot;$250,000 cancer treatments&quot;.<p>Now this political dishonesty is blowing back, as the insurance markets are under strain because the young healthies still aren&#x27;t getting insurance to help pay for the cancer treatments that others get."

It was possible for people to share videos before the internet.  E.g. you could have submitted a description of your video to a printed catalogue, and if people wanted to watch it they&#x27;d contact you via the catalogue, so you could send them a copy on VHS.  What youtube and the internet does is makes it so much easier -- so much more efficient -- that it makes it practical, and the scale enables all sorts of new things to crop up on top of it."

It has native OSX text selection&#x2F;manipulation, great (if a little wonky) autocomplete, easier directory browsing, the ability able to click to add files to git commits, notifications when long processes finish and several other nice touches.<p>The typical hacker news user probably isn&#x27;t going to love this. It&#x27;s certainly not as performant, and probably a slower workflow if you&#x27;re someone that prefers to never let your hands leave the keyboard.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s definitely not ready for full time. I ended up switching back to terminal for now, but I keep watching this closely."

Though i offered to pay 2.5% buyer broker commission most realtors were selling hard to be seller broker instead of taking advantage of the buyer broker commission.<p>So i offered the following:
&quot;Besides giving me the listing price also give me estimated lowest sell price.

comment,14257251,,,1493828691,,chubot,"OK, good to know about D.<p>As far as zero cost, my understanding is that D is still trying to get rid of GC from the standard library.<p>And I&#x27;m explaining why I think Rust is having a hard time getting adoption.  It makes an effort to be compatible with C, but not with C++.  But really C++ is its &quot;competitor&quot;, not C.<p>And C++ has the network &#x2F; lock-in effect I described.  All languages have a network effect to some degree (libraries, documentation), but I think the situation with C++ is especially acute.<p>Also, I would say that safety and zero-cost abstractions are the goal of Rust.  Those two goals conflict somewhat -- e.g. in the decision over bounds checking.  Although I guess you can say that without bounds checking you have no abstraction; you just have a pile of buggy code at zero cost :)"

comment,14257239,,,1493828648,,alphapapa,"&gt; I guess I&#x27;m just more cycnical (possibly pragmatic) than you, because IMO it is &quot;apples to apples&quot;. I believe that the US was captured by corporations long before Trump made it to office, and the only way to sway corporate opinion is to hit them in the wallet.<p>Corporate power is indeed an issue, but I feel like you are changing the subject here.<p>&gt; Sadly, as a foreigner, what I purchase is the most effective way to be heard.<p>I don&#x27;t think your theory is logically coherent here.  If you desire to punish the corporations which you say have captured the U.S., then which candidate was elected President is irrelevant.  More than that, although Trump is an entrepreneur and far wealthier than Clinton, he is also far more independent than Clinton, far less in the pocket of the mega corporations.  On this concern you should favor Trump over Clinton.<p>&gt; Besides, how successful is a business that blames potential customers for not buying their products? &quot;We&#x27;re gonna bomb them until they buy our cars dammit!&quot;<p>Sorry, I don&#x27;t understand your point here.<p>&gt; I also disagree with you about why Trump was elected. I hear this condescension argument all the time but I think it&#x27;s total BS. I suspect it&#x27;s more about jobless (white) men and is a much harder (and real) problem to solve than simply being polite.<p>Well, you&#x27;re entitled to your opinion, but as a non-foreigner, I think you are completely wrong.  In fact, your &quot;jobless (white) men&quot; line is merely repeating the leftist media&#x27;s racist, sexist propaganda.  Note that it is, by definition, racist and sexist.  It&#x27;s inherently condescending, but here you are protesting that condescension had nothing to do with it.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing that you seem to be uncritically accepting this belief.  It doesn&#x27;t even cohere with the data: Trump received many votes from non-whites, non-males, and the employed.  The votes were split primarily along geographic lines!  But don&#x27;t let that stop you from blaming angry old white men for all the problems in the world.  Obviously, if it weren&#x27;t for them, everything would be great..."

What percentage of families starting out with two young kids are able to buy Tesla&#x27;s top models?<p>Model 3 (or Chevy Bolt) price sticker is reasonably within the range of currently best-selling sedans (Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic). If the electricity costs are $0 (public infrastructure and Tesla supercharger network), the 5-year total cost of ownership figures start adding up in favor of electric vehicles. Another variable is service costs - those oil changes can add up, whereas an electric vehicle can reasonably go without a service center visit for a year or more (Tesla&#x27;s 12-month service consists of washer fluid top-off, wiper replacement and battery replacement for key fob <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teslarati.com&#x2F;what-goes-into-tesla-model-s-annual-service&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teslarati.com&#x2F;what-goes-into-tesla-model-s-annual...</a> )<p>So while the initial price sticker might be higher, TCO figures favor electric for most people."

He was very naive, as his book somewhat admits, about how EU politics work (and to some extent about Greek politics as well, where he assumed Tsipras was on the same page as he was).<p>Stathis Kouvelakis, a member of Syriza&#x27;s Left Platform faction that later split from the party, had this criticism [1] about both Varoufakis and his successor Tsakalotos (another economics professor), which I think has some truth to it:<p><i>Tsakalotos said he was very disappointed by the low level of the discussion. In the interview to the New Statesman, Varoufakis says very similar things about his own experience, although his style is clearly more confrontational than Tsakalotos&#x27;s. From this it is quite clear that these people were expecting the confrontation with the EU to happen along the lines of an academic conference when you go with a nice paper and you expect a kind of nice counter-paper to be presented. I think this is telling about what the Left is about today. The Left is filled with lots of people who are well-meaning, but who are totally impotent on the field of real politics.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jacobinmag.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;tsipras-varoufakis-kouvelakis-syriza-euro-debt&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jacobinmag.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;tsipras-varoufakis-kouvel...</a>"

comment,14257107,,,1493828050,,azeirah,"&gt; Why would I want to do all this myself?<p>My bank doesn&#x27;t have this, so that&#x27;s one reason.<p>Another would be that a third-party could write the code that performs the analysis, you should be able to just download (or purchase, I suppose) their script and use it, so you don&#x27;t have to do it yourself anyway. This also means it becomes possible to have competition within this space, right now, you can only ever use your bank&#x27;s analysis tools, if they&#x27;re great, fine whatever good for you. But for some people it&#x27;ll have limitations one way or another. Competition is not a bad thing.<p>Besides, it can be fun to look at your financial data with your programming tools. It&#x27;s an interesting data set to play around with, analysis, data visualization, budgeting, even if just for learning."

comment,14256975,,,1493827511,,paulmd,"Massdrop is branded around group buys of <i>premium</i> goods, not batches of random crap off Alibaba.  I think they would see high quantities of listings as spam&#x2F;polluting their listings&#x2F;damaging their brand.<p>Traditionally that sort of stuff just happens in a thread on a forum somewhere - but I have to imagine that there&#x27;s a pretty significant incidence of non-paying users or organizers who get in over their heads, so perhaps there is a niche there for basically organizing <i>private</i> group buys as well, that are advertised through another medium apart from Massdrop&#x27;s storefront.<p>Hot take here but since you brought them up:  I think Massdrop has their own branding problems.  I used to do them quite a bit but have stopped at this point because the discounts are just not good enough to justify waiting 6 weeks to get my item (and I&#x27;ve had some items that were delayed out to more than 3 months from drop completion to delivery).  I now make it a policy to compare against Amazon or the retailer directly - and since you have to wait a month through Massdrop you might as well compare against Seeedstudio and the other source vendors directly.<p>Usually the discount is pretty insignificant ($5-10) so 
I don&#x27;t do it unless they are truly unique items that just can&#x27;t be had elsewhere.  And often those unique drops are limited to ridiculously low unit quantities and they&#x27;re sold out before I can even order.<p>Not sure how quantity limits make sense on <i>pre-orders</i>, which is supposedly what Massdrop is doing.  Is there only enough plastic left in China for 20 sets of crappy vacuum-formed keycaps or something?<p>It&#x27;s a really nice model for Massdrop since they don&#x27;t have to worry about fronting the money for inventory and waiting a month for the items to show up - their customers will gladly do that.  But they&#x27;re still very much taking the profit regardless of the fact that the customer is the one fronting the money - so it ends up being a terrible deal for the customer."

comment,14256894,,,1493827092,,neom," I&#x27;ve been through a few startups and in all of them I&#x27;ve been within the first 15 or so employees, some of them took on hundreds of millions in VC funding. I regret instances where we took on too much funding, or in instances we took on funding without a good investment strategy for the capital we raised. In the startup I am running today we have taken on about $1.5MM from Samsung, Fontinalis, Story Ventures and a few others, before we did that, we put together a detailed plan of what we wanted to do 2017, and how much it would cost for us to do that, then we went out and sold enough of the company to hire the folks we needed to get to our next proof point. We lightly padded (6 months) additional runway incase we had trouble. We also discussed with our investors why we wanted to prove what we wanted to prove with the money they gave us, how much time the money would give us, and how much more money they would have to give us if we&#x27;re either a) wrong or b) spot another opportunity."

So I don&#x27;t agonize over the retirement part.<p>And one of my guys, as we were winding it down, said something really nice: he pointed out that yeah, we didn&#x27;t get to the retirement part, everyone got to work from home.  He got to be there with his kids, watching them grow up.  His best friend is out the door at 6am, 1.5 hour commute, rarely makes it back in time for dinner.

comment,14256879,,,1493826999,,okdana,"Intuitively i&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s something to do with the way children are &#x27;socialised&#x27;.<p>It seems very common for children living as boys to immerse themselves in video games and computers if they&#x27;re dealing with social isolation or anxiety&#x2F;depression. It&#x27;s almost actively encouraged for them to do so — their parents and teachers treat it as normal, most of their male class mates dabble in it, and when i was growing up in the &#x27;90s at least video games and computers were depicted almost <i>exclusively</i> as the realm of boys. For trans people in particular i imagine the (semi-)anonymous community aspect also offers some degree of freedom of expression&#x2F;identity that they often don&#x27;t have in real life.<p>Children living as girls are not encouraged to get into games and computers to anywhere near the same degree, and for historical reasons they don&#x27;t really have anyone to look to as an example or role model in that space.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that all of the trans women i&#x27;ve heard of who had supportive parents and were able to start living as girls early on aren&#x27;t really interested in games or computers. Admittedly, it&#x27;s a very very small sample size filtered through the lens of what the mass media consider interesting — Jazz Jennings, that girl from Germany, and a few others — but it&#x27;s a pattern i&#x27;ve seen anyway."

comment,14256873,,,1493826950,,jaredklewis,"&gt; Do you even believe that people have right to defend themselves, or should they let the crime unfold and then let the law take its due course?<p>I don&#x27;t think it is simple as that. To be sure, guns might provide positive outcomes in some situations. But does that benefit outweigh their downsides. Downsides like deaths caused by accidents with firearms. Downsides like mass shootings that would be difficult to accommolish without easy access to firearms.<p>As for the benefits, how often do firearms prevent homicide? It&#x27;s a hard thing to measure. I&#x27;m skeptical they prevent much at all.<p>For one thing the type of &quot;gang&quot; style homicide you are imaging is not a very common variety. In 2011, the FBI only identified 11.7 percent of homicides as being carried out by a stranger to the victim. Just by the numbers, getting killed by your spouse or coworker is more likely. I imagine the protective benefit of firearms is far less in these situations.<p>Another point is that even carrying a firearm isn&#x27;t protection against an unexpected attack."

comment,14256843,,,1493826813,,acqq,"&gt; A battery is &quot;used&quot; when it&#x27;s maximum capacity is 80% of it&#x27;s original capacity. The only problem is that it&#x27;s much heavier for it&#x27;s capacity- 25-50% heavier. For permanent storage that isn&#x27;t a problem. Their value could easily be 50% of the original price or more<p>The above claim is exactly what made me skeptical: the greater availability of something reduces its price, so 50% of the price of a new one just doesn&#x27;t sound right, unless there&#x27;s some identified other immense need for them: the number of &quot;used&quot; batteries available to the market would be huge if the number of the buyers of the electric cars would significantly increase. That can only pull down the price of the used ones and increase the price of the new ones. The real question is where the ultimate prices would be, considering these effects.<p>Also, Tesla claims that their lithium batteries last extremely long, that is so if the battery&#x27;s not completely discharged, but every lithium battery in every notebook I have had was the first to die or degrade very fast, even if I surely never &quot;deep&quot; discharged it. And it&#x27;s so small compared to the ones in the car. So there is some significant difference somewhere between what&#x27;s claimed and what I&#x27;ve personally experienced.<p>And what&#x27;s the market for the used up consumer electronics lithium batteries?<p>Also in 2013 Musk&#x27;s company claimed the Model S makes 176g CO2 per mile, controlling their claim gives &quot;346g per mile - more than the 312g per mile the EPA says the Toyota Highlander emits.&quot;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seekingalpha.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;1430161-in-summary-the-tesla-model-s-is-a-dirty-car"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seekingalpha.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;1430161-in-summary-the-tesl...</a><p>My main argument stays -- there&#x27;s no reason to believe Musk, and every for an independent careful control of his claims."

comment,14256837,,,1493826782,,jaegerpicker,"You are partly right about the need to manager deer populations but the key problem is that the cat is out of the bag, in regards to sprawl and large predators. The basic fact is that we are never going to reverse that unless there is sweeping and catastrophic changes to society. Also that leaves a HUGE reason to manage deer populations, hunting itself. Many people use hunting to supplement their normal meat supply and without some form of Government management wildlife would be quickly destroyed. See the American Bison as an example, though just one of many."

comment,14256675,,,1493826010,,thomnottom,"I was curious about the NSAID number. Doing some quick research I came across this quote:<p>&quot;Mortality reported with NSAID use is generally linked to NSAID-associated GI bleeding, and the reported incidence is quite variable. Much of the literature reports 16,500 deaths annually as a result of NSAID-induced GI bleeding. However, it is important to put this number into perspective. This estimate was published in a 1999 observational study evaluating data from the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System (ARAMIS).5 The database captured 19 NSAID-related GI bleeding deaths; the authors then extrapolated this number to the overall US population with arthritis. The 16,500 deaths has been considered overestimated or inaccurate because it was based on a small number of actual deaths and extrapolated inappropriately.6,7 A much smaller number was reported by Tarone and colleagues.7 They reported 3,200 deaths annually as a result of NSAID-induced GI bleeding based on US mortality data reported in the 1990s.&quot;<p>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t access the sources right now.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.practicalpainmanagement.com&#x2F;treatments&#x2F;pharmacological&#x2F;opioids&#x2F;ask-expert-do-nsaids-cause-more-deaths-opioids"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.practicalpainmanagement.com&#x2F;treatments&#x2F;pharmacol...</a>"

It&#x27;s almost exactly the same pattern of thought that people racism is (but without victims).<p>She didn&#x27;t really have a good system for describing what made food (or by extension, people) good, and instead of just living with some uncertainty, her brain created a bunch of rules that correlated with her enjoyment. Then she lazily conflated that with an honest to god definition of good food (people), and used that to exclude just about everything else as uncivilized.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the author of this article would consider this the underlying cause of the problem, and I agree that he comes off as a bit whiny, but I think he&#x27;s noticing a real problem.

The other thing is that the Democrats over-relied on minority voters as a key base, which didn&#x27;t work out for a variety of reasons.<p>I think strategically they missed the fact the ethnic voting requires an ethnic candidate. They also missed that certain key platform positions alienate ethnic factions of their voting base.

The incentives were just so aligned that I think a lot of people might have had their private misgivings, but held their nose and went ahead.<p>Apart from the AAA rating, government bonds also had a very low risk rating in the Basel accords (Basel I, and Basel II that just came into effect during the global financial crisis 2008).<p>Basically, the Basel accords specify a minimum capital adequacy ratio, that is a certain minimum capital level to support given risk weighted assets. (Capital in the bank context basically refers to equity - i.e. funding that can absorb losses without the bank going bankrupt due to debt obligations they cannot fulfil.)<p>Now, the risk weight for government bonds is zero!

Someone noted in the comments here, that there have been countless attempts at solving this &quot;shared runtime for cross-platform apps&quot; idea, apparently with a still unsatisfactory history.<p>Reading through the thread does give me hope, since the discussion is on-going after 2+ years, which means people are interested in an efficient solution. Seeing the HN crowd go at this Electron topic again and again, always with a kind of emotional &quot;turbulence&quot;, implies that this is a worthy problem to solve.<p>I like that one of the recent suggestions is to &quot;split the Electron&quot;, to accommodate bindings with theoretically any language."

SD3 was a huge game on a cramped cartridge, and the Japanese version -- already benefiting from the density of kanji text -- employed a custom compression system that would have made it practically impossible for a localized version of the game to fit within the confines of the ROM without the removal of massive chunks of content. The simple fact is that SD3 was likely never intended for localization, because the process would have been impossible.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamespite.net&#x2F;toastywiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Games&#x2F;G637-SecretOfEvermore"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamespite.net&#x2F;toastywiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Games&#x2F;G637-Sec...</a>"

2. Ford (or Ferrari, if you are well off)<p>Ability to kill is limited by your imagination only. I don&#x27;t want to help, but do the exercise yourself, sit down for five minutes with a goal of hurting a faceless non-existent person and count how many ways you can come up with. Whether the tool is designed for that purpose has nothing to do with it.<p>&gt; I think you should be required to go through initial training, safely store your firearms, and go through refresher training every 2 years. At minimum.<p>Real life, legal, gun needs are more urgent in nature than that. In gang infested areas, one could go through an event during evening grocery shopping run that would make that person buy a gun.<p>Your &quot;Let me feel good with there being a 2 week gun training course&quot; is actually stopping a real life person from protecting themselves in a real life situation.<p>I am fine with the course being a highly recommended thing that people should attend, but it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>required</i> qualification for a gun purchase.<p>Guns are much much easy to operate than planes. Yes, safety is important but self-preservation is even more important.<p>I have seen this lately, existing gun owners are quite fine with new ardent restrictions on new purchases. If we say, everyone must deposit guns at armory first, take a course and then pick up their guns from armory, then we would get an immediate push back from existing gun owners. I got mine, now others should be thoroughly checked before they get their. I don&#x27;t think that is fair to someone who needs a gun for personal safety immediately. Personal safety situations can&#x27;t be planned for unfortunately, it creeps up on you when you least expect it. Last thing you want is some &quot;let me feel good and righteous&quot; has trimmed your rights to bear arms."

Curious who doesn&#x27;t want to grapple with an evidence-based look at bias in a tech leader.<p>Given that the engineer-lead study found this impact when controlling for seniority at FB while the suit-lead one didn&#x27;t for rank, it certainly raises the question of why women have a lower rank for a given seniority.

comment,14256207,,,1493823484,,geofft,"OK. I&#x27;d argue that software engineering and <i>especially</i> senior software engineering (architecture, designing APIs and interfaces, reading and writing documentation, team management) is better correlated with verbal and social aptitude than with mathematical and logical aptitude. Being able to get a tricky sorting algorithm right is the sort of thing a junior engineer is more likely to do than a senior engineer; when the senior engineer does it, they also tend to need to <i>explain to others</i> why the algorithm is right.<p>Of course this is just my belief, as a member of the industry, and not a scientifically-researched conclusion.<p>So, again, I&#x27;m curious to see evidence of why women&#x27;s aptitude is poorly correlated with the specific industry of software engineering. (I would even buy, based on your argument, that women&#x27;s aptitude is poorly correlated with academic computer science, but that&#x27;s a very different field.)"

comment,14256174,,,1493823257,,fittingin,"I was amused to visit Capitol Reef National Park and enjoy a tour of a small canyon where a boardwalk lets you see the names of some 19th century folk carved into a cliff face. Along the way were signs warning you of the criminal prosecution that would result if you carved your own name into the cliff.<p>I have seen significant preservation efforts regarding a name scratched on a hillside near the Grand Canyon. The author was still living down the street from me, but the scratching was 50 years old.<p>The abandoned houses across town are blight, but the one in Yosemite is a national treasure. My child&#x27;s mud hut is a safety hazard, but the one up the cliff is a sacred Anasazi artifact.<p>On the other hand, I have seen a small local wilderness area turn from a fun spot for a family Easter egg hunt to a regional ATV attraction so crowded the local Boy Scouts could no longer camp there.<p>Balancing the past, present, and future is always a subjective thing. When the BLM actually does its job, it does land management. But that is a hard job. It is often easier to just close everything down and not let anyone in. That is not management. But when pressure on a wilderness grows from a couple hundred visitors a year to a couple hundred visitors a day, a policy of &quot;anything goes&quot; is also not management. Management can be expensive.<p>The people in the best position to observe and propose solutions are always local. But BLM struggles to build local partnerships. They try to manage through a multi-layered bureaucracy that ultimately makes decisions from Washington, D.C. The result can often look like the United Airlines video--constructing and enforcing a policy in a manner that doesn&#x27;t fit the local situation. There are any number of ideas that could get the job done cheaper and with more sensibility."

I&#x27;m not sure how things like betting on horse races works, though.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t, but it can be slightly harder for a 16-17 year old to get a fake ID without alerting their parents."

comment,14256045,,,1493822498,,coldcode,"Every country has this issue. In this global universe we live in all &quot;native&quot; foods merge with local culture to produce something new. For example &quot;Mexican&quot; food in various parts of the US is nothing like the food I ate when I worked in Mexico, yet even there regional differences are almost as different. Even &quot;Chinese&quot; food is wildly different dependent on where you are from in China. I grew up eating &quot;German&quot; food that is only barely like any restaurant I&#x27;ve seen in the US, and nothin like what you find in Germany today because it came from my parent&#x27;s remembering what they ate as kids and my grandmother&#x27;s what she learned from her mother. Food is not a static item and never has been. Trying to say the food you remember or eat is &quot;yours&quot; to talk about is sort of ignoring that it is a very personal concept as well as rooted in time and place."

But taking the drunk drivers off the streets or shutting down premises that systematically serve alcohol to kids, is not a bad idea"

comment,14256021,,,1493822354,,hwillis,"&gt;How are the environmental effects ofthe production of the huge batteries, their disposal or recycling evaluated.<p>Very easily.  Batteries are very simple and have about a dozen input materials, usually from single sources.  They are some of the most easily analyzed products in the world.  There&#x27;s a steel jacket with a plastic gasket, a cathode material (in Teslas this comprises lithium, nickel, cobalt and aluminum), an electrolyte mixture (common, safe liquids like ethylene carbonate or dimethyl carbonate), a separator (one of many common plastics), and an anode mixture (around 55%&#x2F;45% natural and synthetic graphite, possibly with a few percent silicon).  Every one of those materials is extremely common, readily available, and highly recycled or recyclable.  Almost all steel and aluminum is recycled, and plastic can easily be recycled.  The electrolytes are just small carbonates, used in a ton of industries.  Nickel is the biggest threat by far- per pound cobalt is slightly worse, but there is 5.3x[1] as much nickel in a battery.<p>If we switched to 100% electric cars using Tesla sized batteries, they still wouldn&#x27;t use as much nickel as the stainless steel industry does.  There is no comparing the byproduct during manufacture.  Lithium battery production is just great.<p>For recycling the worry is solely that the nickel and cobalt will leech from broken batteries into the water supply.  This doesn&#x27;t happen with stainless steel because well, it&#x27;s stainless.  Luckily nickel and cobalt are also the most valuable part of the battery, and are quite valuable to recover through shredding and incineration.  The scrap value of nickel alone in the battery is more than the scrap value of steel in the car, so recycling is virtually guaranteed.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve seen only some very dishonest ones like &quot;once the batteries are not usable in cars we&#x27;ll sell them&quot; where the worth of the used batteries was immensely overblown.<p>Are you sure you have your facts right?  A battery is &quot;used&quot; when it&#x27;s maximum capacity is 80% of it&#x27;s original capacity.  It continues working long after and can even degrade slower.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s much heavier for it&#x27;s capacity- 25-50% heavier.  For permanent storage that isn&#x27;t a problem.  Their value could easily be 50% of the original price or more, for well kept batteries- recycling wouldn&#x27;t even be an issue in that case.  At that price buying used batteries would be almost as cheap as buying gasoline for generators.<p>[1]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;neicorporation.com&#x2F;specs&#x2F;NANOMYTE_BE-45_NCA_Spec_Sheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;neicorporation.com&#x2F;specs&#x2F;NANOMYTE_BE-45_NCA_Spec_Shee...</a>"

comment,14255952,,,1493821866,,Aqueous,"The Russian strategy to interfere in our election to bring about the result that occurred and that they wanted to occur clearly involved many parallel strategies operating in tandem, including targeted social media advertising in swing states, but also including possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and foreign agents, some of whose interactions were captured in foreign surveillance.<p>The surveillance gives us the best chance of stopping something similar in the future. First it does so by letting us know that collusion was happening.
Second, because the Obama administration made the surveillance public, the national security apparatus is in a political position to investigate this independently even though our country is under control of a new regime, due to political safeguards put in place designed to protect the independence of our law enforcement apparatus. Not even Nixon could get around being investigated by his own Justice Department. I&#x27;m not saying this will happen (Trump is a corrupt individual, after all), but knowing about collusion thanks to surveillance puts it in a better position to happen."

The NSA does a whole lot more than monitoring suspected terrorists, even if it a hot topic right now, that is a strange point to bring up.<p>2. I have not read the specifics on this case yet (media seems to still like using &quot;IC is the boogeyman!&quot; slant), but more generally, it is important for there to be a hard line against domestic surveillance of US Persons versus standard foreign intelligence collection. Warrantless domestic collection would be too easy to abuse and more importantly may raise constitutional issues.<p>I am unsure about this case though, probably will need to dig through source material. The linked article is unclear on if this data is minimized (anonymized) or not, as my understanding is that US Person information must be anonymized under all normal circumstances (and additionally USPI cannot be directly queried without a warrant).

- Electron doesn&#x27;t support mobile so I don&#x27;t understand this comment. Their are lib for python on mobile good, bad, or evil I don&#x27;t know. It isn&#x27;t just a lack of DOM related performance issues it is also V8 performance issues, chromium performance issues, and electron performance issues. When you stack a engine on top of a engine on top of another engine you can&#x27;t expect to achieve awesome speeds. And if you are making a desktop app why would you even care about making a website of that app?<p>&gt;Java
Again if you are making a desktop app why would you also need a website performing the same task? React Native is for mobile apps electron is for desktop apps so I don&#x27;t understand why you are bring this up as well.<p>Electron exist same reason nodejs exist webbies to scare to learn another language. JS isn&#x27;t bad, but how people use it makes it bad. I should actually say programmers are to scare or lazy to learn alternative solutions to a problem. It is simpler to use what you already know then to try something else. What does electron bring to the table? A way for someone that know JS, css, and html to produce a cross platform desktop app that is it. You don&#x27;t gain performance, security, and it isn&#x27;t the only cross platform solution like Java once was. People use to use Java only because it was the only cross platform solution. It had horrible memory leaks and all sorts of issues that still plague it to today. Yet it was the only cross platform desktop solution of its time. That is why electron is seen as useless to me I know how to program in c, c++, c#, JS, and elixir. I would probably learn python stack if I wanted a cross platform solution to a desktop app."

comment,14255649,,,1493819885,,ChefDenominator,"At least on the South Bay, I think that drivers are more impatient because the cities have failed to do anything real to improve traffic. They focus on highly visible things, like a new overpass or adding a lane to an onramp, or something of this nature.<p>Then they&#x27;ll spend something like $1 billion on a new library or town hall or $100 million on a rec center or whatever.<p>Meanwhile, the actual road infrastructure cannot support the incredible increase on net new job creation. This makes for traffic jams, everywhere, so people become impatient and increases the number of irrational decisions they make.<p>I live in the hills, several miles down a very narrow, curvy country road. Nobody goes less than 10 mph above the speed limit, which is genuinely unsafe on this road. They do it because traffic is much lighter than the rest of their commute, and they just want to get home. Of course, they&#x27;re only shaving somewhere around 28 seconds of travel time off of their total commute while increasing the probability of a deadly encounter with a hapless bicyclist who ignorantly thinks they are riding on a quiet, back-country road.<p>I am quite certain that the cost of adding a separate bicycle&#x2F;pedestrian path is quite high, as it would require bulldozing parts of moderate sized hills, and compared with the fanfare of a new police station or city hall, a new bicycle lane for some back road just doesn&#x27;t compare.<p>However, knowing the residents of this back road and the town in general, I&#x27;m quite certain such a path would generate a lot of real use and potentially save lives.

He should have tracked down a current seller and interviewed them.<p>Prices have dropped in the past 10 years which I assume means increased competition. It would be interesting to hear how that has affected the business. I&#x27;m also curious about the techniques they use. When I was selling IDs 13 years ago it was teslin, PVC card printers, and Alps printers. I assume the Alps printers are no longer used since they went out of production in 2003 or 2004.<p>A lot of IDs are <i>still</i> fairly easy to replicate.

The remaining 6 operations are there to move around data, including requests to push data down the cache memory hierarchy.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons why the performance of AMD&#x27;s Bulldozer and Piledriver lines scaled practically linearly up to the core count in spite of each floating point unit being shared between a pair of CPU cores.<p>Consequently, HPC research tends to be focused on strategies to minimize the amount of data being moved around, as well as minimizing cache misses, or to take advantage of technology with higher throughput, such as GPGPU.  As AMD&#x27;s Ryzen offer greater throughtput, performance also increases."

comment,14255454,,,1493818195,,will_walker,"The process depicted in the video is a variant of Stereolithography a process by which photopolymer is solidified by exposure to directed UV light. The video depicts the authors using a commercial 3D printer created by Digital Wax Systems. Reading the paper, it appears that they mixed in amorphous silica to the resin and ran the printer successfully. Few details are given on their test rig.<p>This approach has been applied successfully to create ceramics in the past, and doesn&#x27;t seem particularly novel to me. Companies such as ADMATEK are already commercializing this technology.<p>Weaknesses of this approach are that the end part needs high temperature sintering to remove the photopolymer from the part, and will not yield the same material properties as monolithic glass. Significant shrinkage can be expected and the sintering process means that you are limited in the thickness of the parts that can be designed.<p>All in all, this is a nice note, but isn&#x27;t fundamentally introducing a revolution in the 3D printing space."

comment,14255409,,,1493817862,,jetti,"If it only handles web browsers currently then I think it will be a hard sell. The use I see of this would be in settings that companies don&#x27;t trust their employees (call center monitoring comes to mind). That being said, they would most likely be tracking HTTP traffic already so they would be able to tell what sites the employees were visiting. If you could parse out other applications I could see it being a hit."

comment,14255337,,,1493817282,,halfeatenpie,"Haha yeah...<p>Singapore is a big problem.  The network there is so fragmented.  Last I checked, Singtel owns a large portion of Singapore&#x27;s networks but won&#x27;t peer with certain ISPs or anyone peering with certain ISPs.  This meant a Singapore user trying to communicate with a Singapore server sometimes needs to be routed through Hong Kong or another exchange before returning back to Singapore.<p>Don&#x27;t forget SoftLayer&#x27;s network in Asia.  It&#x27;s a real hit or miss on residential ISPs.  One time a client of ours in Seoul on SK was being routed through Japan to hit SoftLayer Hong Kong.  What is usually 40ms latency from Seoul to Hong Kong turned into 90ms of latency with a higher chance of packet loss during peak hours (for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with Asia network, all countries are connected via submarine cables which really makes it expensive to expand bandwidth between countries.  During peak internet usage you really can sometimes experience the packet loss unless you pay more.  Expect higher operation costs in Asia especially since many central IX countries are currently experiencing power shortages)."

The AAA was culpable negligence by Moodys, S&amp;P, Fitch rating agencies. Ignoring the credit quality implication of the discount built into the market price of the GGBs was culpable negligence on the part of the treasurers at the French and German banks.

Close those thousand accounts and they will create a thousand more at the same rate you close them.<p>Add velocity controls for the IP address and you&#x27;ll get a thousand sign ups from a thousand IPs. Limit it by device and you&#x27;ll see a thousand devices. Flag the images using a perceptual hash and the images will come back superimposed on random pictures of food.<p>At some point you find that your accounts are now traded as a commodity on underground markets at various prices by teams that specialize in creating accounts, aging them and selling them for x cents. Add enough restrictions to new accounts and you&#x27;ll find existing shops being taken over and flooded with listings.<p>And do all of this while still having an &quot;effortless&quot; signup  experience for new legitimate vendors."
comment,14255175,,,1493815665,,6d6b73,"I think 30% by 2030 is overly pessimistic. I&#x27;m simply guessing but since average age of the car on the road in the US is about 10 years, cars bought today will be off the roads by 2027. In ten years it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that every car manufacturer will have an electric car in every category for a price comparable to regular ICE. Considering environmental and health benefits of electric cars, together with factors like prices of gas, increase in power produced by solar panels etc it does not make sense to think that most people would decide to get the worse option (ICE).
I think by 2030 90% cars sold will be electric."

comment,14255136,,,1493815204,,MrGrillet,"I enjoyed this talk and took away something slightly different to others on the talk...<p>For me, what was clear is that they listened to feedback and took action relatively quickly. I remember when they first launched the Blackberry version and emailing the team about bugs - I think I got a response the following day and they clearly implemented something by the following release.<p>It wasn&#x27;t about being devoted to a vision of a particular product they were passionate about. They saw a market&#x2F; problem and solved it using their technical ability.<p>Yes, they had a lot of luck on their side - being in the market early enough to gain the visibility. Also, people naturally promoted the app so they didn&#x27;t need to spend much on marketing. Other apps that came after it, weren&#x27;t so lucky. Being well connected and having cash to provide initial runway probably made this easier for him than it would be for most but I think it&#x27;s fair to say he built up his rep at Yahoo - which probably helped when he needed to raise cash."

I was.<p>My wife&#x27;s extended family is really into hunting so I ended up taking a gun safety course to get my hunting license. A LOT of gun safety is preached there. Don&#x27;t brandish your weapons or your prey publicly; keep them to yourself. Always assume a gun is loaded. When carrying a loaded gun, hold it a certain way. When walking with a loaded gun, don&#x27;t point more than 15-20 degrees in either direction if someone is standing next to you. Lock your guns separately from your ammo. And so on.<p>There are a lot of environmentalists (preservationists?) working for the state in this field as well. Managing deer population levels, preventing forest fires, not littering, that kind of thing.<p>So while I was a bit surprised to see a &#x27;red state&#x27; kind of company advocating for federal control of these lands, I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t have been.

Sometimes you need an autoclaves, sometimes not. Things like point loads would need to be designed out as much as possible.<p>Likely because of large existing investments, politics and path dependence, the new airliners built differently will have come from somewhere else.<p>Airbus itself did disrupt the market with composites back in the day with their first plane, and they have a multi megawatt class electric ones in the works, so who knows, maybe they can renew?"

comment,14255079,,,1493814544,,OliverJones,"I&#x27;m an EV customer, in a cold climate, far from the Tesla factory and the smooth roads of the Bay Area in California USA. So I&#x27;ve had some experience of the reality of working with this new tech.<p>Let&#x27;s do the future-perfect exercise. Let&#x27;s imagine looking backward from a point in history when 90% of new vehicle sales (by unit) are EVs.<p>What happened in those years?
1) power cells (the component parts of batteries) became genuine microelectronic parts with fine structure in their insides -- deep submillimeter gaps between anodes and cathodes.  That understanding about their manufacture put their cost-per-watt on a Moore&#x27;s Law kind of curve about nine years ago.<p>2) vehicles routinely get field upgrades to their battery packs.<p>3) there&#x27;s major competition between battery remanufacturing plants and stationary power storage makers for the used battery packs, complete with spam and robocalls begging for the old batteries.<p>4) the power grid companies, in every US state except Wyoming, have now integrated their distribution systems so there&#x27;s distributed control over time-shiftable load. In other words, EVs have grid smarts in them and charge when the spot price per kWh is lowest in their neighborhood. It&#x27;s an auctioning service.<p>5) in Wyoming there&#x27;s a pirate electricity auctioning service available via encrypted wireless and Tor to work around the pro-coal lobby&#x27;s laws.<p>6) truck stops, everywhere except Wyoming, now have megawatt-level charging facilities. Trucks don&#x27;t use I-80 to get across the Continental Divide any more.<p>7) Public housing projects have been compellled to offer EV charging. Apartments without EV charging facilities are now considered substandard. Their slumlords have to discount them at least $200 per month (in 2017) dollars to find tenants.<p>8) An open standard -- called &quot;STREETNET&quot; -- for vehicle-to-vehicle communication has developed with multiple communication channels. An important channel is modulation in brake-light and running-light intensity.  That means a vehicle can announce its status to the vehicle behind it.<p>9) STREETNET has virtually eliminated compression-wave congestion on limited access highways, by helping drivers and autodrive systems see the big picture and synchronize their speeds and acceleration.<p>10) Commuter rail is all electric and autodriving, and has been for five years."

That seems somewhat extreme.<p>Yes, there was a budget crunch after this, but the same budget crunch was felt in similar states without tax policy changes, most likely driven by lingering impacts of the great recession and changes in federal tax policy.<p>Al Franken had a great line about media bias in Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. He said everyone thinks the media is biased towards right or left when it&#x27;s really just biased towards calamity and sensationalism.<p>Cato is right-wing, but the rest of the world is trying to sell you papers.

It might easily be the topping off you need to comfortably reach your destination (or a fast charger!)
And if we&#x27;re talking about a fast charger, that can mean 62 miles added in 10 minutes - we&#x27;re quickly getting into not-at-all-useless ranges.<p>Agreed it kind of sucks for a full recharge though.

Better solutions already exist. Terminal emulators are an already solved problem. What terminal emulator problem will be solved that hasn&#x27;t already been solved by urxvt, KiTTY, Serial, or any of the other Electron based terminals like Magnesium or Hyper?<p>That&#x27;s not to say people shouldn&#x27;t try as there are many reasons to do so.

This is indeed exactly a case where search <i>is</i> necessary, because the pruning applied by this concrete constraint solver is <i>not</i> strong enough to deduce the unique solution. If we only post the constraints, we get:<p><pre><code>    ?- knuth(a, Rows),
       sudoku(Rows),
       maplist(portray_clause, Rows).
    [1, _, _, _, _, 6, _, 8, _].
    [5, _, 8, 7, 2, 1, 4, _, 6].
    [_, 6, _, 3, 8, _, 2, _, 1].
    [8, 4, _, _, _, 3, _, _, 5].
    [_, _, 5, _, 6, _, 8, _, _].
    [6, _, _, 8, _, _, _, 4, 2].
    [3, _, 6, _, 4, 8, _, 2, _].
    [4, _, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, _, 8].
    [_, 8, _, 5, _, _, _, _, 4].

</code></pre>
However, it is exactly as you say: Even assigning a <i>single</i> variable a concrete value automatically enforces the solution by constraint propagation alone:<p><pre><code>    ?- knuth(a, Rows),
       sudoku(Rows),
       Rows = [[_,Var|_]|_],
       indomain(Var),
       maplist(portray_clause, Rows).
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
    [5, 9, 8, 7, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6].
    [7, 6, 4, 3, 8, 9, 2, 5, 1].
    [8, 4, 2, 1, 9, 3, 6, 7, 5].
    [9, 7, 5, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 3].
    [6, 3, 1, 8, 7, 5, 9, 4, 2].
    [3, 1, 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 2, 7].
    [4, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9, 8].
    [2, 8, 9, 5, 1, 7, 3, 6, 4].
</code></pre>
Note though the general point: A sufficiently strong constraint solver <i>could have</i> deduced the unique solution even without trying any concrete value, exclusively by reasoning about the posted constraints with sufficient sophistication! This concrete solver can&#x27;t, due to the particular trade-off between efficiency and pruning strength that was chosen by the implementor, and so search must settle the remaining part.<p>One of the other puzzles is:<p><pre><code>    knuth(d, [[1,_,3,_,5,6,_,8,9],
              [6,8,_,3,_,9,1,_,5],
              [_,9,5,1,8,_,6,3,_],
              [3,_,8,9,6,_,_,5,1],
              [_,1,9,5,_,8,3,6,_],
              [5,6,_,_,3,1,9,_,8],
              [_,5,6,_,9,3,8,1,_],
              [8,_,1,6,_,5,_,9,3],
              [9,3,_,8,1,_,5,_,6]]).
</code></pre>
In this case, the solution is not unique. We can use the constraint solver to <i>count</i> the number of admissible solutions, again using search:<p><pre><code>    ?- knuth(d, Rows),
       sudoku(Rows),
       findall(., maplist(labeling([ff]), Rows), Ls),
       length(Ls, L).
</code></pre>
Yielding: L = 12.<p>This indeed shows that search is necessary <i>in general</i> also when applying constraint programming. Still, no such search is applied in the posted article. In the example contained in the article, the constraints alone suffice to determine the unique solution. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine whether this is the case for <i>all</i> 4x4 Sudoku puzzles."

We know that most startups fail, that means GDX (the subject of the article) will probably fail, so all the negativity is really just a statement of the bleeding obvious.<p>There is a big chicken-and-egg issue here, in that they need to get a large number of users on the site in order to make it somewhat self-sustaining. That pretty much seems to be what is happening now - yes, this is a PR puff piece, that means they&#x27;re serious about growing the site.<p>If there&#x27;s an interesting enough niche, people will come to this. I remember seeing boxrec.com in the very early days; it was still a server under someone&#x27;s desk and had a handful of users - but the guy who set it up knows boxing inside out. We don&#x27;t know the background of this family, but I don&#x27;t think this is just a &quot;let&#x27;s set up a social network!&quot; hail mary.<p>The play-by-play looks genuinely interesting, and we know people want to talk sports in real time. They use Twitter for this (poorly), and Facebook, but it&#x27;s not a venue for hard-core sports fans. If they can bring together detailed play-by-play across a variety of sports, and enable people to talk about it together, and maybe bring in streaming &#x2F; commentary (maybe this is phase 2), this is a very interesting proposition. Building that kind of audience would be massively difficult of course, but also clearly very valuable. Bet-in-play is <i>huge</i>, and that&#x27;s just one aspect.<p>I wish them luck.

comment,14254899,,,1493812294,,alphapapa,"It&#x27;s interesting that you cite the NIPCC report, but then downplay it as merely political and circumstantial.  And since it has a petition, it must be biased, or much moreso than the IPCC report.<p>Yet, scanning through the 135-page NIPCC report, I see plenty of &quot;diagrams and explanations of the science,&quot; which you noted in the IPCC report.  Why, then, do you dismiss it out-of-hand?<p>&gt; Now I don&#x27;t follow the political debate on whether the IPCC is biased by funding or some other supposed disincentives for scientists to report truthfully.<p>This is my entire point.  It is absolutely crucial.  You can ignore it if you want, but you are missing the full picture, and therefore cannot accurately assess the claims of both sides.<p>&gt; On the other hand I do see that there is less obvious evidence of political bias from reading the published reports.<p>I guess you meant &quot;the published IPCC reports.&quot;  I should think that, if any group wanted to push their political view under the guise of science, they would certainly take care to make their reports appear apolitical.  Making your judgment based solely on their own word would be like a judge asking a defendent, &quot;Did you do it?  No?  Okay, you&#x27;re free to go.&quot;  You have to corroborate outside evidence to make a reasonable judgment.<p>&gt; If someone wanted to understand the science it is fairly clear to me the IPCC report would be a much better starting point than the NIPCC report.<p>Again, the NIPCC report appears to explain much science as well, so it seems unreasonable for you to dismiss it while holding to the IPCC report.<p>&gt; There are significant financial incentives for people who stand to lose from climate change mitigation, for example in the oil industry, to fund people to investigate the case against climate change.<p>You&#x27;re right.  And by the same token, there are significant financial incentives for people who stand to lose from <i>not</i> engaging in mitigation.  These range from individual climatologists who have built their entire careers on studying the &quot;crisis&quot; of CAGW (if it were determined that there were no risk, what would their careers have accomplished?  What would they do next?), to corporations selling &quot;green&quot; energy products and carbon credits, to politicians who are using &quot;climate change&quot; to effect their political goals.  For example, Christine Figueres, UN executive of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, recently stated:<p><i>This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.  This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.</i><p>Her stated goal here is not to mitigate the potential risks of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (which might or might not necessarily entail changing the fundamental economic model of the world), but to transform the world&#x27;s economic model.  This is explicitly a <i>political goal</i>, not a scientific one.  The cart (politics) is leading the horse (science).<p>&gt; I would expect if the scientific case was highly suspect as you&#x27;d say that people would have funded equally convincing scientific reports on the other side.  The fact that I haven&#x27;t been able to find such reports suggests to me that there is not a convincing case against the science to be made.<p>This depends entirely on how much effort you have put into finding them and your criteria for &quot;equally convincing.&quot;  In fact, many scientists <i>have</i> found such convincing reports--as you yourself noted, at least 9,000 PhD-holding scientists, and about 21,000 non-PhD-holding scientists, who, by your own admission, are more qualified to judge than you.  Therefore, how can you so easily dismiss one side of the argument?<p>I appreciate your being reasonable in the discussion.  Thanks."

But CMYK would be more useful because the commonly used CMYK spaces can represent a color gamut that&#x27;s closer to the range of shades in the actual paints, whereas the commonly used RGB spaces are too limited. (A regular color printer can print a substantial range of colors that are aliased when represented in sRGB, i.e. you can&#x27;t distinguish them on screen unless the preview is adjusted to compensate.

One of the factors we decided to go for a European car this time (we had a Ford Focus before) is that we&#x27;d like to support Trump America as little as possible.<p>What an exciting new world we live in, in which, before we do any kind of business or trade with a company which has a presence in a foreign country, we must consider all of the policies of that country&#x27;s current, democratically elected leader--and if we don&#x27;t agree with them, we refuse to do any business with that company, thereby attempting to punish the citizens of that country for exercising their right to democratic self-rule.  How dare they have a different opinion.  We&#x27;ll buy local instead.  That&#x27;ll teach &#x27;em to disagree with us.<p>What a sad state of affairs our world will be in if we all stop doing business with those who don&#x27;t agree with us on everything.

Possibly it will push some of the existing terminal emulator projects to add new features, or someone will fork one of them.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s nice to have options, and it&#x27;s nice to see innovation, and if Electron makes it easier to innovate we should be glad of that."
comment,14254584,,,1493809045,,frgtpsswrdlame,I&#x27;ve never much considered accelerationism to be a practical concern but Kansas makes me wonder if perhaps it&#x27;s the way forward. So many tax cuts and now people are voting out extreme Republicans for more moderates and voting for more taxes. Brownback still has the veto which is holding things back a bit but the state has moved left.

They&#x27;ve sold their house and cars, but still need somewhere to live, they&#x27;ll still need to travel and of course eat.<p>Additional costs could be through marketing, not sure if they&#x27;re doing paid ads?

story,14254563,Are you sure you know what Saas marketing is?,1,1493808857,,Boroccoman,"Even those who are not interested in marketing and sales come up with Saas, cloud marketing or software on demand. But a few of us understand the conception of Saas business. Often I am asked this question – what area is you involved in, what is a branch of your activity?  And when I try to explain it sometimes (or even very often) people cannot understand me. 
In this regard I wondered – what if not only my mansion is uninformed about this sphere of business. I&#x27;ve try to search some information, but all I can see searching the internet were obscure formulations and unclear definitions. So my company decided to give light on this question. Even if you are aware of Saas marketing - do you know differences between outbound and offline marketing? Why can too many leads affect your business badly? Why marketing and advertising are not synonyms?  Get interested?:) This article is waiting for you)

I&#x27;m a full-stack web developer with experience in building SaaS services in couple of startups, Chartio in San Francisco and Smartly.io in Helsinki. Since 09&#x2F;2015 I&#x27;ve been a community manager in an entrepreneurship community &#x2F; coworking space helping young entrepreneurs to get started and network.<p>I have a wide perspective on product development from both the technical side (I can code and build stuff, been doing that since I was 11 or 12) and the business&#x2F;customer side (from seeing dozens of startups get started and working in small startups myself). Analytics and data is really close to my heart and working as a data engineer would be awesome.<p>I&#x27;m also a good community manager. My background there is in non-profits such as Rails Girls and my current work at Boost Turku. I also run a tech meetup Turku &lt;3 Frontend for local developers that has gathered over 300 people in a bit over a year to the community.<p>Learn more about me at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hirejuhis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hirejuhis.com</a> and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hamatti.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hamatti.org</a>.

comment,14254539,,,1493808457,,na85,"You appear to be suggesting we forgive the project for its poor memory footprint because Electron was used as a sort of rapid prototyping tool to get v1.0 out the door.<p>I think you know just as well as everyone else that this project&#x27;s use of Electron is unlikely to be an interim measure. It will (probably) always be a resource hog, just like Chrome will (probably) always be a resource hog.  That&#x27;s a conscious choice that is here for the duration.<p>Using Electron may have accelerated the process but let&#x27;s not pretend that the author is going to rewrite it in something more performant once a little traction is gained."

That way the decision to be compelled to provide authentication will rest on people not being interrogated in an airport."

comment,14254371,,,1493806372,,ageofwant,Its perfectly reasonable to stick with a conclusion once you reached it. You don&#x27;t stick your penis in the blender every time you walk through the kitchen to check whether or not its still as unpleasant as before. At some time you may actually commit to accepting the evidence. Having a open mind should not stop you from learning.

We need to allow bikes on the shoulders of highways. (Got a ticket as a kid)<p>3. Personally, although I hate regulations, I would like to see all public buildings, and any new, or remodeled commercial buildings be required to provide showers for all employees whom bike to work.  They would get an extra 10 minutes before clocking in.<p>4.  Ride a mountian bike in the city.  Don&#x27;t ride a road bike, unless you&#x27;re very skilled.  I&#x27;ve seen so many guys go down.  Bike messengers never seem to get hit, or have much trouble, but they are professional bikers--sorry, but they are, and I know some drive crazy.<p>5.  Give a state credit to all employees whom bike to work. (I don&#x27;t know how you could verify it.)<p>6.  I put my bike in my truck, and drive to San Fransisco daily.  I try to park for free, and bike from there.  I only use old bikes.  The nice ones are stolen.  It&#x27;s not great, but you get used to the routine.  Oh yea, since there a huge problem with cvechicles break-ins, take every thing of value out of the vechicle.  Open the glove compartment.  Put a kill switch in vechicle.  And pray your vechicle is there when you get back.  I sometimes leave the door open--just too many broken windows for a radio."

comment,14254353,,,1493806203,,i336_,"FWIW, I&#x27;ve compiled Chromium (which took a while because the build needed more RAM and swapped) and accidentally left random scripts erroneously chewing 100% CPU for hours (woops) on Contabo&#x27;s $9 offering (6GB RAM, couple cores, 500GB disk, 100Mbps). Never heard a peep from Management™.<p>Performance is mildly all over the shop - eg, some days packages might install in under a second, other days pacman stalls for 30s+ &quot;resolving dependencies&quot;, and then a further 2-3+ minutes regenerating the manpage cache or whatever it&#x27;s doing - but, you can peg both cores, and they don&#x27;t seem to care. So there&#x27;s that.<p>It&#x27;s in Germany, and ramp-up time to US servers takes a couple seconds (eg, pulling data from the US will take a moment or two to wind up to ~12MB&#x2F;s). Similarly, latency is mildly high.<p>A big plus: it&#x27;s just QEMU and they give you access to the KVM VNC console. You can kill iptables when it goes rogue! You can disable SSH!<p>Oh - a tidbit to remember: they do mention that if you use &gt;60Mbps for 6 hours+ they kill your link, but I learned from some friends what that means in practice: your connection goes to 10Mbps for the rest of the month.<p>Not a shill, just mentioning what I learned from using a friend&#x27;s instance for a couple months. Would be interested to hear about any negative experiences people have had so I can file those away too.<p>---<p>Another option: online.net have dediboxes based on Atom C2350s with 4GB RAM, 1TB and 1Gbps networking, for €8.99&#x2F;mo (+€20.00 setup).<p>So on the one hand you&#x27;re dealing with this sadness: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ark.intel.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;77977&#x2F;Intel-Atom-Processor-C2350-1M-Cache-1_70-GHz?q=Intel%20Atom%C2%AE%20Processor%20C2350%20(1M%20Cache,%201.70%20GHz)"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ark.intel.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;77977&#x2F;Intel-Atom-Processor-C23...</a><p>But on the other hand it&#x27;s a dedicated machine. The CPU has virtualization support (despite being 1.7GHz :D hahaha). That&#x27;s gonna translate to 100% usage sooner or later... so... that may be a potential alternative.<p>I haven&#x27;t tested this option, it would be very interesting to pit it against a Contabo VM."

comment,14254344,,,1493806108,,friendzis,"You are only scratching the surface. The real problem is not for mobile to take over, we can do it, but when to consider wifi down. It is all fun and games if your wireless network is connected to good fiber, but it is not always the case. Internet uplink may be high RTT or flaky itself, it may be low speed and someone started torrent client and video call, it may as well be the very same mobile broadband with &quot;unlimited throttled home&quot; plan, wifi AP can be connected to gateway over multiple wireless hops, etc.. Platform always has to question &quot;is it problem with remote end or uplink? is uplink 2 better than uplink 1?&quot;<p>Network switch comes with non-zero cost that all connections must be treated reset and have to be reestablished, so even if the platform monitors quality of all uplinks, we still need some uplink stickiness to avoid constant switching between uplinks in places with spotty coverage or flaky uplinks.

I&#x27;m reminded of a scene from Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;.<p>Excerpt from Chapter 17:<p>A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox&#x27;s table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips.<p>&quot;Good evening,&quot; it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, &quot;I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?&quot;<p>It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them. Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox.<p>&quot;Something off the shoulder perhaps?&quot; suggested the animal, &quot;Braised in a white wine sauce?&quot;<p>&quot;Er, your shoulder?&quot; said Arthur in a horrified whisper.<p>&quot;But naturally my shoulder, sir,&quot; mooed the animal contentedly, &quot;nobody else&#x27;s is mine to offer.&quot;<p>Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal&#x27;s shoulder appreciatively.<p>&quot;Or the rump is very good,&quot; murmured the animal. &quot;I&#x27;ve been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there&#x27;s a lot of good meat there.&quot; It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again. &quot;Or a casserole of me perhaps?&quot; it added.<p>&quot;You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?&quot; whispered Trillian to Ford.<p>&quot;Me?&quot; said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, &quot;I don&#x27;t mean anything.&quot;<p>&quot;That&#x27;s absolutely horrible,&quot; exclaimed Arthur, &quot;the most revolting thing I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot;<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the problem Earthman?&quot; said Zaphod, now transferring his attention to the animal&#x27;s enormous rump.<p>&quot;I just don&#x27;t want to eat an animal that&#x27;s standing here inviting me to,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;it&#x27;s heartless.&quot;<p>&quot;Better than eating an animal that doesn&#x27;t want to be eaten,&quot; said Zaphod.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s not the point,&quot; Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said, &quot;maybe it is the point. I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m not going to think about it now. I&#x27;ll just ... er ...&quot;<p>The Universe raged about him in its death throes. &quot;I think I&#x27;ll just have a green salad,&quot; he muttered.<p>&quot;May I urge you to consider my liver?&quot; asked the animal, &quot;it must be very rich and tender by now, I&#x27;ve been force-feeding myself for months.&quot;<p>&quot;A green salad,&quot; said Arthur emphatically.<p>&quot;A green salad?&quot; said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur.<p>&quot;Are you going to tell me,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;that I shouldn&#x27;t have green salad?&quot;<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the animal, &quot;I know many vegetables that are very clear onthat point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am.&quot; It managed a very slight bow.<p>&quot;Glass of water please,&quot; said Arthur.<p>&quot;Look,&quot; said Zaphod, &quot;we want to eat, we don&#x27;t want to make a meal of the issues.

So each passenger would have its own private space. Travel time should be much shorter due to using fast lanes and low number of bus stops. During rush hours the bus should take 5 passengers (6 with self-driving technology). Because of small size it should economic enough to use the bus only for one passenger, even in suburbs. Uber like software should be used for costs optimization, for example you could wait for the bus in front of your house or walk 500 meters closer to the main road to save $5. All needed technology already exists. No need to dig tunnels.<p>PS. In Central and Northern Europe bikes are only useful for 4 months a year.<p>PS2. I don&#x27;t want to discuss how many days per year someone can ride an e-bike to work. Some sort of public &#x2F; car transport is and will be needed.

    - largely decoupled from the vehicle
</code></pre>
This is a huge architectural change because we&#x27;re factoring environmental effects out of the vehicle, which allows for accelerated improvements without changing the car itself as well as economies of scale resulting in better environmental efficiency. Switch from coal to nuke and all currently running EVs stop emitting a lot of CO2 <i>at once</i>. Switch to wind+solar and they&#x27;re suddenly all nuke-waste-free too. The same car could change to more recyclable battery tech (swappable batteries, battery rental...) over the course of its life and become progressively cleaner. So even if it provides an increase <i>right now</i> (which it doesn&#x27;t, plus we&#x27;re just living on a huge carbon credit card anyway) it certainly won&#x27;t on the medium to long term."

When one of these foreign-binding-cells in the library actually binds a foreign protein this cell multiplies like crazy and eventually the clones secrete free floating versions of the antibodies that neutralize the protein it detected, some of these clones stick around in the bone marrow to form a long-term memory-library of previously activated antibodies.<p>There are actually two separate systems: the T cells and B cells.

The documentary is called &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Death&quot;. Actually, the whole documentary is really good:

His goal was definitely to assimilate C code, with compatibility being a high priority.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure the goal was to make C++ hard to use from other languages.  I think that just fell out of the focus on zero-cost abstractions.<p>COM seems like the right middle ground between baroque C++ interfaces and RPC&#x2F;message passing.  You write native code, but it can interoperate dynamically with components in other languages, in the same address space.  But I think it is overly tied to OOP, and that doesn&#x27;t play well with the style of Unix.<p>I wonder if it would be possible to do better, or if that ship has sailed.

comment,14253819,,,1493798200,,Sacho,"I think this article is a prime example of the things I hate about advocacy journalism.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the journalist started with a narrative in their head - the second sentence is <i>&quot;It&#x27;s a creepy concept that cues an avalanche of questions&quot;</i>. I don&#x27;t think pursuing an agenda is bad per se, but it&#x27;s not really reporting work, and I think it must follow different rules - specifically, it needs to have argumentation for its assertions, provide evidence for factual claims, and analyze alternate explanations.<p>&gt; &quot;I think we know enough about human psychology that if you can get yourself to mistreat a very lifelike, human-like thing, then it&#x27;s probably just good rehearsal to doing that to a real human,&quot; Pizarro added.<p>The quote from the &quot;expert&quot; is illustrative - it is an appeal to authority with no further investigation, no sources to back it up, etc. While that might be the standard formula for a news report, it&#x27;s not enough for an argumentative article. Is David Pizarro a leading scientist on this subject, does he have publications and research to link to? Who knows, it&#x27;s not presented in the article.<p>There&#x27;s a pathetic attempt at presenting the &quot;counter-argument&quot; but the link is to a site that is debunking it(and also advancing the same narrative) - this doesn&#x27;t give me much confidence that the counter-argument was presented fairly and not just straw-manned.<p>The proliferation of sex dolls and sex dolls brothels may be an interesting topic worthy of a discussion. &quot;The previous Mic article&quot; hints to one interesting issue: <i>&quot;When I tried to find a sex robot for straight women online, options were scarce.&quot;</i> However, it then immediately tries to shoehorn the discussion into the narrative with an &#x27;explanation&#x27;: <i>&quot;That is likely because not only is the tech industry dominated by men, but also because companies founded by men are more likely to get funding. &quot;</i> (How about the &#x27;likely&#x27; explanation that women aren&#x27;t looking for sex dolls? How would that not possibly cross your mind?)<p>This article and the ones it links to are just poorly written agenda pushing. They are what you would look for in an evangelism blog, a strongly opinionated presentation with very little research and argumentation, no thought put into alternate possibilities.<p>The big question that pops up in my mind is, &quot;of what use is this to me&quot;? I don&#x27;t know who Claire Lampen is, why I should respect and value her opinions. She doesn&#x27;t really present any serious argumentation for her position. She doesn&#x27;t even seem to be concerned with the actual consumers who are seeking out this product, just how this will &quot;negatively affect women&quot;...which reminds me of this quote from Hillary Clinton:<p><i>&quot;Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat...&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s hard to take the pleas for subscriptions from magazines and &quot;newspapers&quot; such as this one seriously. With this kind of low-effort advocacy journalism, Mic competes with every opinionated blog on the subject, and it will always come short - I can at least develop some kind of emotional connection and relationship with a blog writer by following their writings; the online &quot;news media&quot; still treats them mostly as replaceable cogs."

At least in the UK in comprehensives when I was in school (I guess I left 4-5 years ago) Microsoft absolutely dominated - every computer was Windows, and if you did a presentation it was PowerPoint, a poster it was Publisher etc etc. In fact I believe that the curriculum for most subjects involved some sort of computer skills.. which was always Microsoft stuff (or I guess computer research counts too).<p>ICT was exclusively Microsoft too. It&#x27;s so bad that when I was looking at universities for Computer Science many actively discouraged an ICT A Level and I can&#x27;t think of any that rewarded it in any way. They owned the ICT curriculum, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they literally wrote it. The closest thing to practical programming was recording VB macros. My ICT teacher told us they got major discounts from Microsoft and I imagine that goes for every similar school.<p>There is a computing curriculum but my course didn&#x27;t even offer it - which isn&#x27;t a surprise because our ICT teacher had no programming knowledge. I imagine most similar schools were in the same situation, where all they taught was Microsoft-sanctioned ICT to an exam&#x2F;curriculum that might as well have been written by Microsoft, using Microsoft software exclusively, to the extent that ICT is a negative for technical further education where it should be a boost.<p>Everyone leaving school knowing only how to use Microsoft things was obviously good for them, they controlled or might as well have the entire judgement of student&#x27;s ICT knowledge through exams, I wonder how they blew it."

comment,14253618,,,1493795045,,robinhartley94,"This is a really good point, and in the future it would be really cool to implement it on anything. However, it&#x27;s tricky to guarantee compatibility with every num pad out there, and there are several pieces of software which try and do this already but come up against numerous problems.<p>In the spirit of keeping it simple, I&#x27;m using an Arduino as the heart of it as they are simple to programme and people can hack and tweak to their own needs, rather than struggling with firmware upgrades etc.<p>I do really like your idea of making it work with a range of hardware. I&#x27;m actually going to release 4 different designs ranging from a single button right up to the 12 mechanical key version you see in the link. That way people can choose their price range. Could be as low as £15 !"

comment,14253603,,,1493794813,,mikekchar,"I don&#x27;t think it will take Toyota and Honda long to get on the bandwagon.  While they did take a wrong turn with hydrogen (and that&#x27;s blatantly obvious in Japan where the Nissan Leaf is starting to become popular), they have invested <i>really</i> heavily in electric drive train cars.  It&#x27;s not like they have to start from scratch.<p>The <i>really</i> big loser among the big boys in Japan is Mazda.  They are reportedly <i>just</i> getting into hybrid vehicles in 2019 and while they are also planning a &quot;bespoke&quot; electric vehicle, I really don&#x27;t think they are taking it seriously (could be wrong).<p>Mitsubishi has a production electric vehicle that I&#x27;ve seen from time to time in Japan.  Again, the Leaf dwarfs it in terms of popularity (at least out where I live), and I&#x27;m still not sure what to make of it.  I&#x27;ve never seen one when casually looking into a Mitsubishi showroom, and I don&#x27;t think they really see it as mainstream.  If you go to a Nissan showroom, though, the Leaf is front and centre.<p>It will be interesting to see where it goes.  I personally predict that Japan, as a nation, will go electric far before the US does.  The distances that people drive here are typically quite short because the speed limits are very low.  A lot of people would consider 100km to be quite a long drive.  I&#x27;ve also seen charging infrastructure pop up here (mostly in luxury hotels, but also in many businesses and apartment buildings -- alas not the one I live in)."

comment,14253366,,,1493790784,,Theodores,"I recently watched two episodes of &#x27;Fully Charged&#x27; on YouTube that featured real motoring journalists singing the praises of electric to the extent that I don&#x27;t think that they are really interested in old fashioned cars in quite the same way. One of the guest journalists was Rory Reid of Top Gear fame and I have since warmed to the guy and rate him (rather than think he is some Top Gear sad petrol head person). The other was the guy from the UK Channel 5 motoring show - Johnny Smith - and, again, he knows his electrics:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PDoItji6Gdo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PDoItji6Gdo</a><p>These people are important influencers and they are not making the sad &#x27;Top Gear&#x27; jokes about electric cars. Check out how the Renault electric sports car is &#x27;sold&#x27; in the above video, why would you buy a conventional hot hatch when you can have something with serious performance that is pretty handy for getting the child seat and baby gear around? These motor journalists also seem pretty pleased with the quiet, the &#x27;brrm brrm&#x27; noises are not important unless that is all a car really does, along with lame power slides around a deserted level airfield.<p>My favourite phrase learned from electric car journalism is the &#x27;guessometer&#x27; the range the car apparently says it has.<p>Electric cars are great however I think that autonomous and electric cars will make roads safe again, so pedestrians and cyclists can use the road without fear of instant death. We will be able to lower the arms race of driving around in tanks, therefore electric bikes will make a lot of sense as will pure pedal bikes. My estimate is that the liner for the front &#x27;trunk&#x27; on a Tesla weighs as much as my bicycle so there is a long way to go before I upgrade to a fancy electric car to &#x27;go greener than I am&#x27;."

comment,14253300,,,1493789695,,njarboe,"I&#x27;m not sure how it works exactly, but Google&#x27;s own cellular company, Google Fi, promotes the fact that they use WiFi when available, even for phone calls, but can switch quickly to cell when needed. Phone calls are not interrupted when switching. I especially like this setup because my cellular reception is poor at work, but I can use my employer&#x27;s WiFi to receive calls and data. Phone call clarity is better on WiFi than cellular but sometimes there is a bit of lag that reminds me of calling overseas using geosynchronous satellite connections in the 90&#x27;s.<p>Great prices also. Since I&#x27;m almost always using WiFi, the $20 a month for global unlimited text and phone calls with a $10&#x2F;gig data rate means I only spend about $25 a month for my smartphone service.

People purchase things because they decide that the benefit is worth the cost. Advertising makes people pick one brand over another when they already plan to buy something, and it helps sway someone&#x27;s decision when they&#x27;re not sure if it&#x27;s worth buying. It also brings their attention to products that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have known about.

comment,14253264,,,1493789114,,js8,"I think marcosdumay already explained it pretty well.<p>&gt; I would have described SQL as statically typed because columns are given a type when created.<p>Both statically and dynamically is a misnomer because it&#x27;s akin to something more in-between - like a dynamic language which can create, say, an empty list and declare it can only contain integers.<p>Just quickly though - I believe static typing helps productivity, because you don&#x27;t have wait for some edge case in your program (in this case infrequently invoked query, since SQL is often embedded in other language) to fail. There are other benefits, like Quickcheck.<p>I think better term (which would explain the distinction between schema creation and query compilation) would be static typechecking of queries against the schema.<p>&gt; The issue arises with multiple tables<p>In general, SQL is quite adhoc in what it lets you do, and anything more complicated you need to resolve with code generation (for example running same query over different tables). It&#x27;s very hard to reuse SQL code. That&#x27;s ugly, and functional languages offer a better solution - high-order functions. I think what I really want is to deal with schema (and other things, such as result set) as first-class types.<p>I think the language should be functional, but also total (every function will finish, no recursion allowed), to make it easy for compilers (query engines)."

comment,14253216,,,1493788401,,19eightyfour,"There&#x27;s that right. But not all stories are about the corporate world or something like that. A lot of stories are about relationships or Adventures or fictional stories completely. In The stories of our lives, representation is mixed and balanced. So I don&#x27;t think on-screen world does represent the real world... outside of extending say, inequality present in the corporate world, through narrative, to other Realms where it is not present or not as present. So I think that&#x27;s a form of bias creation and  misrepresentation that doesn&#x27;t work to promote equality... Or reality.<p>Secondly, movies are fictional worlds so they can represent whatever their creators choose them to represent. They could be representing more equally. They&#x27;re not.<p>To me the misrepresentation of reality and the bias representation of the fictional world in Hollywood movies is a really clear example of sexism.<p>Just one example and I&#x27;m a huge sci-fi fan of the Alien series and Prometheus series.

comment,14253204,,,1493788180,,thirdsun,"&gt; That + the fact that it was tied to your phone number was in my opinion genius.<p>This is an important aspect. Having accounts and contacts based on phone numbers allowed my mother and her friends to use the service in no time - those are the kind of people that don&#x27;t know their own email address (if they have one at all) and would never register for an account on their own. Phone numbers, however, is the system they already knew since using SMS."
comment,14253201,,,1493788148,,adrianmonk,"I&#x27;ve found myself in all three situations: where performance didn&#x27;t matter much and something like JSON or XML was fine, where performance mattered and a binary format was an obvious win, and one situation where serialized data needed to be as compact as possible and I could only achieve that by hand coding.<p>To me, formats like JSON or XML have one clear advantage: debugging is easier. I can fire up a decoder for a binary format, but that slows down the investigation.<p>That said, most binary formats have a schema file due to necessity of not serializing field names. That schema file makes it easy to have tools that spit out language bindings. And that reduces the tedium of actually writing code that uses (and validates) the data, so I generally prefer those formats for that reason."

What if in the distant future, terrorist groups or weird death cults like Aum Shinrikyo are able to more easily develop or obtain biological or chemical weapons that can dissipate into a large urban area quickly?</i><p>All the more reason to stop with band-aid solutions like spying on the entire world, and engage in real efforts to bring education, infrastructure, and stability to the regions most prone to creating terrorists.<p>The NSA is part of a broader picture of US military and intelligence agencies that involves selling arms without oversight, overthrowing democratically elected governments, funding rebel groups that later become terrorists, congressionally unauthorized military action, a network of unscrupulous military contractors like Blackwater and Dyncorp, relationships with brutal regimes like Saudi Arabia, and political fear-mongering and propaganda in the US and abroad to afford a thin veil of legitimacy to these activities.<p>You are scared of terrorism, and so is the other side.

comment,14253159,,,1493787440,,tedsanders,"Yes, that&#x27;s what I wanted to say. Which is why I said it.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some facts:<p>* No one in the market agrees that energy will abundant and cheap in 10 years due to solar and batteries becoming far cheaper than natural gas. Natural gas companies have not been shorted to zero. Utilities are continuing to make capital expenditures. Natural gas plants are continuing to be built. Corporations are continuing to sign long-term power purchase agreements with renewable generators that lock in prices for 20 years. Maybe everyone is suffering from a collective delusion, or maybe energy transitions take decades.<p>* The EIA projects roughly flat energy consumption out to 2040, with natural gas and renewables taking share from coal and nuclear. Hardly abundant.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;outlooks&#x2F;aeo&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;0383(2017).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;outlooks&#x2F;aeo&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;0383(2017).pdf</a><p>* For natural gas power plants, about 1&#x2F;3 of the levelized costs are capital costs.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;outlooks&#x2F;aeo&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;electricity_generation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;outlooks&#x2F;aeo&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;electricity_generation....</a><p>* There are strong dynamic effects that will slow the transition. As the penetration of solar grows, the non-solar consumption peak will move to night-time and the marginal value of solar falls by about 1&#x2F;2. Conversely, as natural gas plants shut down, their cost of fuel will fall and the value of their spinning reserve and other ancillary services will rise.<p>* Building a transmission backbone for new utility-scale solar will take decades. San Diego&#x27;s Sunrise PowerLink took 5 years of environmental review and construction, for instance:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irwaonline.org&#x2F;eweb&#x2F;upload&#x2F;web_novdec_12_SunrisePowerlink.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irwaonline.org&#x2F;eweb&#x2F;upload&#x2F;web_novdec_12_Sunrise...</a><p>* Increasing the supply of large power transformers to build out a new transmission backbone for utility-scale solar will face significant supply constraints:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energy.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;prod&#x2F;files&#x2F;Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Study%20-%20June%202012_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energy.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;prod&#x2F;files&#x2F;Large%20Power%20Transfor...</a><p>* Today no energy storage solution is economical. Probably the solution with the great hope of scale-based cost reductions is batteries. How many batteries would we need? World electricity consumption is about 50,000 GWh per day. If solar displaces natural gas, then for overnight and peak backup, we need storage on that scale.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=world+electricity+consumption+%2F365.24"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=world+electricity+consu...</a><p>* Can we hope to even approach producing 50,000 GWh of batteries within 10 years? Global annual production of batteries is around 30 GWh a year right now. There are factories under construction now to bring that up to around 100 GWh around 2020. Given that factories take years to design and build, that means we need to scale lithium production by roughly a factor of 1,000 and scale battery production roughly a factor of 1,000 and get the plans and investment lined up in the next couple years. Is Tesla ready for 1,000 Gigafactories? Absolutely not.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;li-ion-featured.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;l...</a><p>Regarding your transistor example - First, according to Wikipedia and Science magazine, the transition was gradual over the 50s and 60s:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vacuum_tube"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vacuum_tube</a><p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;return-vacuum-tube"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;return-vacuum-tube</a><p>Second, the size of vacuum tube industry was never the size of the global energy industry. Building new transistors factories can be done. But building new factories to ramp up to trillions in battery and solar cell production within a single decade is ludicrous.<p>P.S.

So it&#x27;d be very hard to share code with others because as soon as you start building abstractions your language and worldview diverges from everyone else&#x27;s version of lisp - to use a library you have to learn someone else&#x27;s mini-language.

comment,14253021,,,1493785415,,chetanahuja,"&gt; Ideally the phone would handle this in a smarter way, e.g., by monitoring the strength of both the wifi and data signals and switching to whichever is likely to have the least packet loss<p>The tradeoff here of course is battery life. The phone OS doesn&#x27;t want to switch on a second radio until absolutely necessary for obvious reasons."

My hunch is that they&#x27;ll continue to find paths to long-term and more predictable revenue to mitigate the anxiety we&#x27;re seeing with the stock. A lot of people don&#x27;t really understand what Twilio does and its value proposition within the investment community. It&#x27;s tough to sell this as a viable investment option if you don&#x27;t truly understand what the platform does.<p>I do think this is just temporary. They&#x27;ll bounce back.

comment,14252901,,,1493783490,,esm,"I think by cure they mean eradicate the virus, rather than suppress it. Most people can live relatively normal lives by keeping their viral load low, but this involves taking expensive medications every day for the rest of one&#x27;s life. The drugs are things like protease inhibitors, modified DNA bases, etc. that muck up the virus&#x27; replication machinery so that it cannot make more copies.<p>The goal of a lot of researchers is basically an HIV antimicrobial that kills the virus in the same way you might treat pneumonia, so that maintenance therapy is not needed."

comment,14252883,,,1493783227,,pnathan,"&gt; When I moved to the Bay Area, I justified the increased cost of living as the sunshine tax as well as the cost of reducing the risk of unemployment in a down economy. Even in the event of another crash specific to the tech industry, I guarantee I&#x27;d have an easier time getting another job out here compared to flyover country.<p>This is the specific reason why I have self-limited my living situation to one of the major tech centers in the US. The downside is nearly unlimited if you&#x27;re in a rural area: particularly if you have a house. You <i>must</i> be able to get a job if your company collapses, and <i>most</i> companies get shirty about remote work for people they don&#x27;t know. So you&#x27;re stuck trying to move in a hurry, to a place where you have no network.

comment,14252832,,,1493782495,,ClassyJacket,"I don&#x27;t understand your point in the slightest.<p>I don&#x27;t (usually) drink cola for the caffeine, as far as I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s just there as a legal way of getting customers chemically addicted to their product. I didn&#x27;t think many people (consciously) bought it specifically for the caffeine at all.<p>As for diet - I also don&#x27;t drink it because I want to ingest sugar. I have plenty of food energy available to me as a first world person living in 2017 and if anything, too much of it. The sugar is there purely to make the drink taste good. I didn&#x27;t think anyone else really drank it for the purposes of ingesting sugar either. In some drinks (No for Dr. Pepper, but yes for Pepsi), I find the artificial sweetener tastes perfectly acceptable.<p>I drink cola because it tastes good and satisfies thirst. Not because I want caffeine or sugar. Those two things are bad for me.<p>Since I don&#x27;t want the caffeine, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the taste of artificial sweetener, I drink caffeine-free diet cola. It still satisfies the goal of quenching thirst and tasting good.<p>What&#x27;s your argument?"

She has for a few years considered buying cheaper party supplies (plates, napkins, etc) in bulk and selling them in <i>addition</i> to her hand made crafts because customers generally need and so are going somewhere else to buy these items anyways.  This is a case where allowing mass produces items would be a win-win, as the customers could get their custom and generic items in one order (they specifically ask if they are offered), and she could make some additional money from each order.

Not to over simplify, but software is patentable if it is new, useful, and not obvious given what has been done before.<p>Once you make the software publicly available, you have one year to patent it in the U.S.  Other countries don&#x27;t grant this one-year grace period.  So, foreign patent rights depend on filing before you make the software publicly available.<p>I asked my colleague, who is a patent lawyer, his thoughts on this and he recommends just filing a full patent application, not a provisional patent application.  A provisional patent application isn&#x27;t cheap either.  And you have to file the full application within a year anyway.  So, it&#x27;s just added costs, deadlines, and administrative hassles.<p>Hope this is helpful."

Steer clear of anything that puts O2 into the air that&#x27;s anywhere near EPA approved &#x27;safe&#x27; levels (which are probably still too high).<p>Some folks use O2 generators for mould remediation when the house is unoccupied and subsequently ventilated (known as &#x27;ozone shock treatment&#x27;).

It&#x27;s one of those gems where the author is clearly just really really into air quality, and who has a very good nose for BS &#x27;science&#x27;.<p>EDIT: Oh, also, another good option to deal with some VOCs (like benzene) are certain kinds of houseplants. NASA studied this so there&#x27;s a fairly credible list of plants to choose from: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NASA_Clean_Air_Study"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NASA_Clean_Air_Study</a><p>EDIT2: Also, assuming you don&#x27;t live near a major highway or something, one of the best things you can do to improve your indoor air quality is open a few windows and blinds. EPA studies suggest indoor air quality is usually far worse than outdoor air quality. And opening blinds lets more sunlight in, which will retard mould growth. And it&#x27;s all free. Free!"

The router has to wait for everyone else to stop using the band—and then take that opportunity to tell them to all shut up for a moment—before it can say anything. And <i>it</i> has to finish what <i>it</i> was saying before it does even this, because it has guaranteed its clients it would send packets of certain lengths by certain deadlines. (Plus QOSing: as the person owning a router, you almost always want your <i>established</i> wi-fi connections to take service priority, so that your phone coming gradually into range as you get home doesn&#x27;t kill your family&#x27;s downloads.)<p>Add more antennas, and you can say more things on more channels at once. &quot;Enterprise-grade&quot; multi-antenna routers (e.g. routers in conference halls) negotiate new connections much more quickly.<p>Cell towers are essentially a <i>whole bunch</i> of antennas (or a few antennae in highly-MIMO setups, so effectively the same thing) so there&#x27;s comparatively next to no latency for sending &quot;unexpected&quot; packets to the tower.<p>(Establishing connectivity with a new cell is still hard, though, since it takes a moment for a handset to get the tower&#x27;s attention when the handset doesn&#x27;t yet know where precisely the tower <i>is</i> for MIMO-beamforming to kick in. This is ameliorated by many cellular ISPs mirroring connection state between neighbouring cells, so that when you move from one cell to another, the new tower is already &quot;expecting&quot; you.)"

She has a great reputation, and she still makes sales, but not because of Etsy.  It&#x27;s simply a store front for her where she can direct people that she finds via other avenues, such as Facebook and referrals.  I imagine part of the reason of the decline is the fact that she focuses on higher end handbags, and doesn&#x27;t try to compete on price.  I&#x27;ve told her that she&#x27;s isn&#x27;t going to compete with Asia on price, so focus on quality and custom work.<p>Not to mention the fact that Etsy has done nothing to improve the sellers experience in years.  Sure, they put out some new way to design your store front with something more custom, but practically speaking, it lacks critical features.  She literally sent a customer to the store to pay for the bag via Etsy, and the customer couldn&#x27;t find the PayPal button to pay because they didn&#x27;t offer PayPal through the custom storefront.<p>It&#x27;s really bad when your store prevents a legitimate customer from making a purchase, and that&#x27;s literally what you are selling.

I think it could easily heat up even more.<p>Theranos is a scandalous outlier. Yik Yak had no path to profitability. Have you been watching the stock market recently? AMZN, TSLA, FB, GOOGL, AAPL have all set huge all time highs."

I think you had to be fair on this - that requirement accounts for a large amount of the design compromises that make other products so poor.<p>Breaches on popular PHP forum software account for a disproportionate amount of the breaches we regularly hear about. It&#x27;s caused issues for Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and the &quot;Cosbycoin&quot; compromise is hard to forget. I can&#x27;t complain about any particular vendor because they have all had their share of issues in this space.<p>Yes, you can write good PHP - but start saying &quot;one click on any hosting plan&quot; and suddenly composer is out the door, every file is owned by the user the web servers runs as and you start pollyfilling for ancient versions. It means you can&#x27;t assume SSL will exist, it means you can&#x27;t get updates using git or any sane automation strategy, and look at how Wordpress deals with cron.<p>Wordpress is regularly lambasted for their support of ancient versions of PHP, which is something they do primarily to meet this goal.<p>In interested in what other options are out there.

I&#x27;m still getting used to doing full one-page apps in it but after being about 30 elements into development I can say I can&#x27;t go back to the world prior to this approach. Starting with the smallest atom-esk elements and then building up makes building new things faster and faster then the previous build. We&#x27;re using it to build an open source edtech platform, polymer is allowing us to open source our designed elements individually so that they can also be built on top of &#x2F; remixed.<p>webcomponents.org also is over 800 elements now and I&#x27;ve found some really good ones starting to show up from the general population outside of just google&#x27;s core polymer team which is really promising."

But the fact is that my code tends to be really close to done before I&#x27;ve even run it.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that&#x27;s sort of a technicality, though. I&#x27;ve been programming for a long time, most of my career without anything more sophisticated than a text editor. I&#x27;ve taught myself to be pretty good at running code in my head, even fairly complex code. So what I&#x27;m really doing while I&#x27;m writing code is running it in my head as I write it, and finding the unhandled edge cases and other bugs while I&#x27;m doing it. I&#x27;m also compiling the code (if applicable) which finds other bugs. So, by the time I run the code for real, most of the bugs are gone. This is all a natural part of the act of coding for me, so I see it as coding rather than running&#x2F;debugging. (I often debug in my head too; handy when you know roughly where a problem is but can&#x27;t reproduce it.)<p>I agree completely with your last paragraph; that all helps to be able to hold the execution state in your mind while you&#x27;re reading through the code."

This use value can be greater than the exchange value---a worker using a drill press is much more productive than a worker drilling holes by hand---and the excess use value allows the capital inputs to add excess value to the products, as well as the labor.<p>Marx mentions the concept of use value right before exchange value and Value in Chapter 1 of Capital; the whole formulation of Marx&#x27;s concept of the LTV takes use value into account: &quot;The labor embodied in labor power is the labor value of the means of subsistence which the worker requires to reproduce his labor power. In other words, the value of labor power is the labor value of &quot;necessary consumption&quot; used to maintain the workers. The use value of labor power is the labor which the capitalist can get out of the worker. The difference between the number of hours which the worker works and the labor value of labor power is the source of profit under capitalism.&quot;[0]<p>Not to mention that Marx probably read Smith before starting on Capital, and Smith had introduced the concept before him. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an oversight (unless he had drafted Capital without use value beforehand) as much as it is the fact that English translations of the book and decades of explanatory volumes have read Marx in a myriad of ways, all admitting that Marx simply wasn&#x27;t very good at writing. Althusser for example suggests to skip the first few chapters. There is even debate now among for example Zizek and Wolff about the different forms of value elucidated by Marx. On the whole, I don&#x27;t consider Marx&#x27;s values to be muddle-headed as Russell says, I consider them hard to understand, and I can only hope that I am understanding them semi-correctly.<p>As to the worker using the drill press, the labour embodied in the machine is coupled with the labour of the worker (who operates the machine) being transferred to the products, labour being the creator of the use value in the sheet, but its combination in totality with the press counting as the exchange value, as a portion of the total societal mass of abstract labour, reduced to unskilled labour. That&#x27;s my understanding, anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to compare use values and exchange values, though, despite the fact that they are both products of labour.<p>&quot;This common “something” cannot be either a geometrical, a chemical, or any other natural property of commodities. Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities, make them use values. But the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value. Then one use value is just as good as another, provided only it be present in sufficient quantity. Or, as old Barbon says,<p>“one sort of wares are as good as another, if the values be equal. There is no difference or distinction in things of equal value ... An hundred pounds’ worth of lead or iron, is of as great value as one hundred pounds’ worth of silver or gold.”[8]<p>As use values, commodities are, above all, of different qualities, but as exchange values they are merely different quantities, and consequently do not contain an atom of use value.&quot;[1]<p>I must admit though that I&#x27;m really quite sketchy on this. When it comes to Marx&#x27;s theory of value, I&#x27;m a novice, having only started to read up on this a couple of weeks ago. There are alternatives to Marx&#x27;s conception of the LTV, found within Post-Keynesian Economics though I haven&#x27;t read into that.<p>[0] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dreamscape.com&#x2F;rvien&#x2F;Economics&#x2F;Essays&#x2F;LTV-FAQ.html#Exploit4"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dreamscape.com&#x2F;rvien&#x2F;Economics&#x2F;Essays&#x2F;LTV-FAQ.htm...</a>

comment,14252166,,,1493772691,,ocdtrekkie,"I&#x27;m not seeing how your comment addresses my point. The neveragain.tech pledge <i>does</i> have a very vague term about &quot;misuse of data that&#x27;s illegal or unethical&quot;, but the majority of that pledge also refers very specifically to government overreach. It was in response to questions about if any of the companies would help Trump create a database of Muslims, and cites a variety of examples that all are about government abuses and overreaches that involved technology to implement.<p>While agree with the statement others have made that neveragain.tech has a <i>stronger</i> pledge, I still don&#x27;t feel it has much to do with extremely unethical practices in the companies themselves so much as insisting those companies don&#x27;t help the government with it&#x27;s unethical practices. If an employer is reading these pledges and taking note, they&#x27;re going to see that they should resist government actions to use their data, not that they should make any consideration how they use that data themselves."

comment,14252148,,,1493772528,,thinkaboutit113,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.<p>I too, am a female engineer at one of the well known companies in the Bay Area.<p>As a background, I have a masters degree in CS and am in my 5th year of working as an engineer.<p>Here&#x27;s the problems that I faced:<p>1. Not taking my opinions seriously - I experimented with this one! My manager would endlessly argue over every small opinion I had but the same opinion that my colleague would have, would get noticed and sometimes even praised. Even on silly things. I can&#x27;t get into project details but for a new project, I suggested that we try out the desktop version of Git to make transition from p4 easier. My manager was absolutely against it and asked me to setup a p4 project for the same and make it work with p4. A coworker(10 years my senior) suggested we use the same desktop version of git and we switched, no questions asked. I figured he changed his mind since both of us said it. This happened 4 times before I once, actually told my opinion to my colleague to convey to my manager and my manager complied with no questions asked. This is how I get my opinions across now. I do understand that I don&#x27;t have 10 years of experience but I can be right sometimes. And no, the same did not happen to the new guy on the team. I noticed it only when my male colleague pointed it out to me and sympathized with me on being micromanaged.
2. Growth - I cared less about growth as far as I had a decent salary to live with. I am someone who likes to work for the challenges I can solve and not for the minor salary increases or bonuses. May sound stupid but each person is different. This was fine until I realized that I wasn&#x27;t given more responsibilities because they were given only to senior engineers. Being promoted to different levels means a salary increase is a must(company rules). I definitely wanted more responsibilities. Each year it was a different story as to why I wasn&#x27;t promoted and the hardest part? Being told that I work like a senior engineer and if I do more work, I&#x27;ll get the promotion next year.
3. Being classified as the &#x27;diversity quota&#x27; - I have as much qualifications as much as the next guy, if not more. I work on side projects during the weekends and am picking up machine learning out of interest on how to incorporate it in my daily work. Being the only girl on the team, people wanting to hire me to increase their diversity numbers but not plan on assigning me good work, being treated as the female-employee-at-work to boost the company&#x27;s image alone, sucks. Imposter syndrome is real and these opinions contribute to it more.<p>I took up engineering to solve hard problems. It is sad that the culture of a company&#x2F;valley contributed to me contemplating want to quit engineering to do something where I&#x27;ll be treated right.<p>Not all problems women face have to be sexual harassment to get noticed, these workplace biases are hard to navigate. This is especially to people who diss diversity programs, there is the reason it&#x27;s in place. I&#x27;ve received so much help from women-focused diversity programs and have even helped fix a problem or two along the way.<p>Finally, on a funny end note, I&#x27;m a big hacker news fan and have noticed how passing constructive feedback that can sometimes come across as negative but useful on a system&#x2F;product&#x2F;post is fairly common here. This post is hopefully taken in the same manner and not a female-ranting-about-things comment."

The vast majority of non-rural people you have spoken to don&#x27;t do this.  Don&#x27;t lump them in with that behavior.  This anecdote is only meaningful to the most bigoted anti-country-folk person.<p>&gt; Unlike urbanites this leads to rural youth learning much younger that old people have wisdom, or at least respectably interesting stories.<p>Again, there&#x27;s no reason to believe that kids in Brooklyn or Staten Island that spent time with their grandma or uncle while their mom was at work don&#x27;t appreciate the elderly.  I think you have an idea of city folk that is shaped by young, unattached 20-somethings or upper-income transplant families without extended family.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s representative of cities made of mostly different people.  You may have surrounded yourself in a bubble during your time in the city.<p>&gt; Urbanites don&#x27;t understand because they live without beauty, somehow. No one ever daydreamed about seeing the grease trap at McDonalds back by the overflowing dumpster on a crisp winter morning. Or watching the daily migration of the homeless as the wind blows trash past them down the street. Or inhaling diesel bus fumes on a hot summer afternoon.<p>This is where you go for crass insults.  Sure, it&#x27;s easy to find ugly places in a city.  It&#x27;s harder to find them in the country.  But to claim that city folk just love Soviet architecture and don&#x27;t appreciate green plants is just absurd.  You can&#x27;t deny that looking at a skyline from a distance is beautiful.  You can&#x27;t deny that most cities do incorporate greenery in their planning, that almost all have a picturesque river&#x2F;lake&#x2F;ocean view.<p>I would rather live in a rural area with space to breathe and unspoiled beauty.  I think the rest of your post illustrated your point pretty well."

comment,14252103,,,1493771924,,lisper,"F# and all ML derivatives are an aberration because they use juxtaposition to denote function calls.  That eliminates a lot of parens but personally I find the result less readable.<p>But compare to, say, C where no one complains about the parens:<p><pre><code>    int fact(int n) {
      if (n==0) {
        return 1
      } else {
        return n*fact(n-1);
      }
    }
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s six pairs of parens.  The only reason it&#x27;s not more is because some function calls in C are disguised as operators, and those just happen to be the functions that factorial uses.  If we wanted a semantically equivalent function that handled bignums you&#x27;d have to write:<p><pre><code>    bignum fact(bignum n) {
      if (bignum_is_zero(n)) {
        return n;
      else {
        return bignum_multiply(n, fact(bignum_subtract_1(n)));
      }

Now you&#x27;ve got nine parens.  But still no one complains about C because of that."

      border: 1px solid;
      width:100mm;
      height:100mm;
    }
</code></pre>
everything but not 100mm square.<p>In Sciter Engine (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciter.com</a>) I&#x27;ve fixed this by applying three simple principles:<p>a) all logical length units are distances measured on <i>device surface</i>. Thus 100mm div rendered on screen will be 100mm when measured by the ruler put on monitor&#x27;s surface. Same is while printing on paper.<p>b) 1px is always one device pixel - so we have hairlines for example. And so dimensions of bitmap images can be expressed with their natural resolution.<p>c) 1dip logical length unit (device independent pixel) was introduced for the convenience. 1dip == 1&#x2F;96in - that is close to 1px in browsers.<p>Without all these using existing browsers for UI of desktop applications is quite questionable.<p>Even for mobiles ... main pointing device is a finger. It <i>shall</i> be the way to say: &quot;this button shall is touchable by finger - so be precisely of 0.5in measured EXACTLY on screen surface&quot;."

comment,14251821,,,1493768995,,jzwinck,"Having used both SWIG and Boost.Python professionally, I find manual work required by the latter to be 100% worthwhile and usually necessary.<p>C++ and Python are not very similar, and the result of auto-binding them typically gives up a combination of fluency and performance.<p>A simple example of the former is a C++ algorithm which writes to an output iterator. In Python this might be expressed as a generator. But none of the auto-binding tools can do this transformation.<p>As for the latter--performance--I have seen 100x performance penalties in practice when the blind lead the bind.  A good example is that in Python we have memoryview and the buffer protocol, but auto-binding tools take these no further than std::vector (if that).  A C++ API which produces a large stream of numeric data just begs to be bound using the buffer protocol or perhaps even NumPy directly. But if a C++ API produces small values really quickly, an auto-bound one will produce the same small values really slowly.<p>Some people see the writing of bindings as manual labor to be avoided. I see it as an optimization opportunity. There are huge gains available."

Everyone has biases, nobody can be neutral. But you can certainly be impartial.<p>Framing, composition are also aesthetic decisions, not just political ones, and those decisions are made both by the photographer at shooting time and picture editors at publishing time. The point is to draw the reader into the story.<p>Making corrections and alterations to digital images is not &#x27;stupid&#x27;, it is a development that has occurred over time in response to accusations and revelations of genuine manipulations and fakery. With film, large-scale changes were very hard and almost impossible to do with the original negative or positive, so elaborate printing techniques were considered to be almost entirely aesthetic and artistic. With the advent and ascent of digital darkrooms, manipulation and alteration is easier and harder to catch, therefore the appropriate approach is to respect the original pixels and not change any: the integrity of the picture can never be called into question.<p>This is a potted summary and there are certainly more nuances, complexities and subtleties than I can relate here, I also have a Masters in Photojournalism and do not appreciate the abusive tone bolted onto the previous comment."

comment,14251641,,,1493767647,,wahern,"An aside: I visited Mongolia a few years ago and learned that Mongolians almost universally dislike fish. And given that the vast majority of Mongolians were pastoral and nomadic until about 10 years ago, the many pristine lakes and streams of Mongolia are filled with ridiculously large fish. The waters are very accessible, too, because the vast majority of the land in the country is open to allow the population to freely roam and graze their livestock.<p>I&#x27;m not an avid fisherman, but anybody who is should seriously consider visiting Mongolia before it&#x27;s too late. An exceptionally brutal winter in 2009 killed many livestock and drove millions of people to the capital city. And in the past 10 years the mining industry has exploded. The population is rapidly moving away from nomadic pastoralism and toward industrialization and private property. While I&#x27;m sure most of the country will remain undeveloped for quite some time given its size, with the mining operations the waterways are likely to become increasingly suspect.<p>FWIW, it&#x27;s not that Mongolians are like some isolated tribe in the Amazon. They&#x27;re fully aware of the world and enjoy a decent literacy rate. But the Soviets kept the Mongolian economy relatively undeveloped, perhaps because the pastoral culture fit the communist ideal. With the collapse of the USSR the country stayed on the same course until about 10-15 years ago when outsiders (especially South Koreans) poured in to develop the resource extraction industries."

If you do the fundamentals of &quot;success&quot; (develop technical knowledge and skills, build social capital, work on interesting problems, etc.), you will be a success after graduating from either of these schools.<p>Second, I would focus most on where you want to live geographically both during school and after -- this will drive a lot of your happiness in life. UIUC grads will have an easier time landing jobs in the Midwest, and UVA students will generally have an easier time finding jobs along the East Coast (esp. mid-Atlantic).<p>Third, neither of these departments will hinder your intellectual development. Hands down, you yourself will be your biggest limiting factor (the big winners at good schools are folks who embrace autonomous learning). That said, I suggest you look at the research projects&#x2F;programs&#x2F;centers led by professors at each of these schools and see which ones have more projects that make you say &quot;hell yeah!&quot;. Go to that school and try to work on one or more of those projects. Figure out a way to be useful to the lead researchers ASAP and possibly start working with them now or this summer.<p>If you still can&#x27;t decide after doing the above, I will add some marginal issues for each school:<p>UVA<p>+ Scholars programs sometimes have unstated benefits like access to jobs, funding, or social contacts. This is potentially big (not sure at UVA specifically).<p>+ Priority scheduling is a big deal at big schools. Avoiding crappy profs makes school a lot more fun.<p>UIUC<p>- The state budget is in shambles, and the school has had some upper administration issues in the recent past. The school is currently not in a great place organizationally as it has been in the past.<p>- Relies a lot on international students (which is cool imho), but the students and their funding may vanish rather rapidly if the US is perceived as being hostile towards immigrants. This has the potential to create a bigger administrative mess.<p>Let me know if you have any other questions, and I will be happy to answer."

comment,14251554,,,1493766824,,laumars,"&gt; <i>SSL termination is the most latency sensitive thing in the stack</i><p>That really depends on your infrastructure and how it copes with load. Latency can be introduced in so many different areas. While some parts of the stack might operate at a much lower latency, they can quickly cause far more significant bottlenecks once throughput is increased - even just marginally. This is why load testing is so important - it&#x27;s easy to make generalised statements but it&#x27;s even easier to overlook something or poorly tune one of the numerous ratios one defines in a typical complex stack.<p>&gt; <i>Anyway my point was you can get all those features without involving heavy L7 multitenant MITMaaS.

They&#x27;ve engineered synthetic protein sensors of dsRNA that induce apoptosis on detection - this mimics the natural viral detection systems that all cells use to prevent viral infection.  The argued benefit is that this artificial protein avoids the common hacks that many viruses use to circumvent the natural detection pathways.  For this to work you have to (1) inject a ton of this foreign protein into the blood, (2) have it persist and be taken up by many cells in an organism, (3) not elicit a negative immune reaction against cells expressing this foreign beast on their MHCs (4 - for prophylaxis) have it persist long enough to provide realistic protection against future viral infection events (5) hope that the distribution of protein-transduced cells overlaps enough with the natural viral targets to provide some clinical utility.<p>The costs of trying to turn a novel therapeutic approach into a real therapy are extremely high - hundreds of millions of dollars.  I&#x27;m unaware of any approved therapy that utilizes protein transduction of cells - I also suspect existing protein transduction methods aren&#x27;t very efficient.

comment,14251416,,,1493765597,,eldavido,"I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot, and here&#x27;s my .02 on the matter.<p>If you look at politics now, there&#x27;s a decidedly anti-elitist trend. This is why Trump got elected. I felt the movie &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; portrayed the ex-Bay Area&#x2F;other &quot;creative class&quot; cities&#x27; zeitgeist really well. There are just a huge number of people struggling to get by, trying to make their mortgage payments, in tons of debt.<p>At the same time, I find Snap fascinating. Anecdotally, it seems to appeal to young people, people bored working low-end jobs, and others I wouldn&#x27;t call &quot;rich&quot;. And despite the CEO&#x27;s dumb comments about &quot;a social network for rich people&quot;, there&#x27;s a raw, back-to-basics, &quot;for normal people&quot; feel they&#x27;ve worked hard to cultivate.<p>I think that if Apple isn&#x27;t careful, they could be seen as an elitist, out-of-touch, &quot;rich person&quot; phone company. Like, &quot;this is the phone for people who drive E-Class Mercedes. I want a phone for people who drive a truck, drink Miller, and watch football&quot;. I could totally see this happening if the Asian Android manufacturers keep nipping at their heels. At some point, phones are going to hit saturation in terms of how much new functionality people care about. And I think there will be a space for a device that&#x27;s further downmarket, more affordable, and not as aspirational&#x2F;elitist as an iPhone. It would be a phone that does about 80% of what an iPhone does today, GPS, video calls, camera, good battery life, etc., but without some of the really &quot;gadgety&quot; recent stuff on the iPhone, like 3D touch.<p>I also think that if computing overall moves to more of a conversational&#x2F;message-oriented paradigm, it&#x27;s going to cause the form factor of phones to change a lot, and become more &quot;invisible&quot; in favor of simpler devices, or even a pair of headphones that talk directly to a mobile network.<p>The other thing to keep in mind, history shows incumbent tech companies aren&#x27;t &quot;replaced&quot;, they&#x27;re just outgrown by new ones. IBM is _still_ selling mainframes, just not PCs or mobile phones. So the more likely case is, some new thing comes up and has even broader appeal than Apple products. Granted, it&#x27;s hard to see how that could happen with their sales volumes, but that&#x27;s what history suggests."

comment,14251365,,,1493765240,,cortesoft,"In this example, you are better off taking the short term capital gains penalty (I did the math in a sibling comment).<p>However, your logic isn&#x27;t correct; no one is arguing that you would be better off having never purchased the stock at all versus paying short term capital gains. What we are trying to figure out is if it is worth taking LESS profit in order to pay LESS taxes. This calculation depends on how much less profit we are talking; as long as the profit lost by waiting until one year for long term capital gains to kick in is less than the difference in tax rate, it is worth it to wait.<p>You can prove that both situations are possible is easy to show. If your profit before long term kicks in is $10 and the profit after is $9.99, it is obviously better to wait until long term kicks in; you are going to pay WAY more than 1 penny per share in extra taxes. However, if the profit goes from $10 to $2 a share, it is obviously better to take the higher profit and pay the extra tax."

comment,14251281,,,1493764569,,arielweisberg,So the issue is that you can&#x27;t get an invariant TSC without Ring-0 access? I assumed AMD already had invariant TSC before Ryzen that was accessible from userspace. Certainly Intel has had that since Nehalem if I recall. It just seems an odd thing to be hard considering how important it is.<p>I never thought about it being a cycle count since I usually access via a wrapper. I guess the wrappers are converting from cycles to nanoseconds.

I put my watch on in the morning and it is automatically unlocked the next time I unlock my phone with touch id. From this point on, the pin is never required. Apple Pay is just a double click on the long button, no pin entry as you&#x27;ve imagined if the watch is unlocked, which is true unless you&#x27;ve only just put on the watch.<p>waiting for the face to light up however, is a legit complaint.

comment,14251179,,,1493763851,,RussianCow,"&gt; fish is generally pretty boring and bland<p>That depends entirely on the type and quality of the fish. The most obvious example is salmon, which has a great, unique flavor and texture if cooked properly. White fish tend to be more bland on average, but there are some that are very flavorful; for instance, ling cod is absolutely delicious grilled (or seared) with nothing more than olive oil and salt&#x2F;pepper. And then you have oily fish like herring and mackerel that are generally not cooked, but rather cured, pickled, or smoked, that are flavorful enough to be eaten on their own (but also make fantastic accompaniments in dishes like dressed herring).<p>In fact, you could say that a lot of lean cuts of beef are &quot;boring and bland&quot; as well: they don&#x27;t have a ton of flavor unless you add herbs, spices, and&#x2F;or fat.<p>(All that being said, I don&#x27;t disagree with your other points about convenience and safety.)"

comment,14250999,,,1493762152,,throw2016,Apple took the macbooks up by $200 for little reason. There was an article just a week ago that the surface book line was not doing well.<p>The obvious reason is because they are overpriced. And now they have made it even worse. This does not make much sense. Hopefully manufacturers like Asus can step up with even better quality Zenbooks and do not join this &#x27;premium&#x27; binge.<p>It seems the &#x27;premium manufacturers&#x27; see this as a non-elastic market and want to take the prices to around $2000. But is there enough differentiation in laptops beyond the screen and build quality to justify that premium. Everything else is off the shelf components and these dual core chips just don&#x27;t seem to be worth this kind of money.<p>Even &#x27;premium&#x27; phones are becoming dramatically more expensive with every refresh that are way out of sync with component prices.

comment,14250942,,,1493761658,,zigzigzag,"The issue is not necessarily hiring. There was a story on HN a while back saying how Facebook recruiters had stopped bothering to target women specifically because even though they were heavily incentivised to do so, the FB hiring committees weren&#x27;t on board with the whole positive discrimination thing so it wasn&#x27;t working.<p>However, the big tech firms do seem to have a problem with firing. I&#x27;ve heard this several times now from other people and saw it myself when I worked at Google. Hiring is never 100% accurate and so even if hiring itself is unbiased (questionable at best), without unbiased firing the quality of that segment of the worker pool goes downwards over time. Even though the engineers often truly believe in a meritocracy, HR in particular is a strongly female dominated profession and unfortunately I do suspect a &quot;sisters gotta stick together&quot; mentality because I saw within the span of a single year at Google a man get canned for merely not being particularly productive, whilst a woman who openly and repeatedly lied in meetings (and lied very badly at that), and who caused her team huge heartache due to her terrible quality work, was not only not fired but in the end promoted into management. It was widely known that women who weren&#x27;t very good or caused trouble were almost impossible to get rid of and were typically transferred around between teams rather than shown the door."

But there is value to &#x27;free&#x27; market competition; it&#x27;s a useful tool and also provides freedom, in the sense of liberty, a core value of our society. Government intimidation of businesses is almost always a bad solution to the problems; law and regulation are democratic and much more just. Infosys isn&#x27;t the first - remember the businesses whom Trump claims to have intimidated about their factory locations.<p>&gt; It&#x27;ll create market inefficiency, which will allow other promising companies to compete, which can potentially raise the quality of the end-result.<p>Fundamentally, that&#x27;s not the result of inefficiency.

You can grab any Chromebook from the rack in the back of the classroom, open it up, log in and immediately get to work on your report or whatever.<p>First of of all that&#x27;s not entirely true.  Nothing is instant.  It wakes up fast, but not instantly.  Login is fast, but not instant.  First time login is fastish but not fast or instant.<p>Windows has had Roaming User Profiles since NT, Google calling the feature &quot;cloud based&quot; is just another way of saying remote.  Since Windows 8 you could have a Microsoft Account which was a &quot;cloud based&quot; user profile and use Sky&#x2F;One Drive which is a &quot;cloud based&quot; data repository.<p>My guess is you didn&#x27;t watch the webcast?  They made special mention of the fact that with Windows 10 S they had improved the login and first login times to be much faster than your typical Windows experience.<p>&gt; I got an original Chromebook from Google I&#x2F;O years ago based on an ancient ARM chip, and it&#x27;s still perfectly usable for when my kid&#x27;s friend comes over to do homework and they need an extra box.<p>That was what they advertised here.  In Windows 10 prior to this announcement you could grant any other Microsoft Account access to login to your machine and it would download their profile and provide them access to their One Drive.  The experience isn&#x27;t as fast as on a Chromebook but it&#x27;s less than a minute.  The emphasis in this announcement was that with Windows 10 S they got it down to under 20 seconds which is Chromebook speed.<p>&gt; Windows and Mac computers will never be that easy to setup, use or maintain.<p>I would disagree.  With what they announced today, Windows 10 S is pretty damn close."

comment,14250852,,,1493760974,,mschuster91,"Because it&#x27;s usually the drug consumer him&#x2F;herself who decides what to buy and consume - and given that most of the drug sellers apparently don&#x27;t cut their products with weird stuff from rat dung to lead, fentanyl or other stuff that sometimes causes dozens of ODs (fentanyl-contaminated heroin batches are well known for this, and a plague for ERs because the victims always come in a bunch) one might argue that clean, vetted drugs via TOR&#x2F;Silk Road are better for society than if the users would hit the streets. Also, drugs bought on the streets directly finance the street mafia and contribute to gang violence, as well as negative reputation for the &quot;dealer city quarters&quot;.

comment,14250738,,,1493760045,,gnaritas,"There are no proper natural keys, natural keys are a bad solution to the real world problem of running and managing an application.  The correct solution is to use a constraint to enforce the uniqueness of your supposedly &quot;natural key&quot;, and use an artificial key to actually join and code against because quite frankly natural keys suck and are commonly multi-column keys that require updating and joining against all of which make them poor choices for programming against.<p>Surrogate keys don&#x27;t break your app and code when business rules change or you finally figure out your natural key isn&#x27;t so natural and has exceptions that forces you to make it not a key.  If you think natural keys are a good solution, you&#x27;ve not lived outside of the database where real $$ is on the line.<p>Those who live in a SQL ivory tower where breaking changes don&#x27;t matter like natural keys; those who actually write applications that use databases and have to deal with the constant churn and change of business rules know how foolish natural keys are and being pragmatic and understanding how to correctly use a pointer to avoid the need to cascade updates and make the schema immune to business rule changes have long ago chosen surrogate keys which are the vastly superior engineering solution."

comment,14250636,,,1493759452,,theseoafs,"Not sure what you&#x27;re asking here.  Usually the semantics behind what happens to an unused variable (i.e. is the file automatically closed, etc.) come down to how the language is designed.  It could be automatically destroyed (like RAII in C++) or it could just be forgotten.<p>In a purely functional language with affine types, unused variables are usually just optimized out."

comment,14250618,,,1493759348,,ezyjules,"It is illegal (discriminatory) to have any policy based on gender. As such, you cannot have a maternity or paternity policy. Thus primary - the parent of the two who will leave their role temporarily as the main caregiver whilst the other partner continues to work OR secondary - the other.<p>Note though that a health insurance policy in the US will cover maybe 60% of 8 weeks of salary for the birth mother under a disability benefit claim (no joke). If a father becomes the primary caregiver, then the company is paying 100% of that time off, without support. So offering equal carries a cost and guarantees that all your employees, male or female, if they are having a kid will take that time and incur that cost, rather than a % gender of your workforce. All things you need to factor in and cost into a business, especially a small one."

comment,14250612,,,1493759316,,theseoafs,"Depends on the implementation of the language.  In a typical functional language with linear types, the functions that mutate an object return a &quot;new value&quot; that is conceptually a modified version of the first value.  So fleshing out our example:<p><pre><code>    open : () -&gt; File
    close : File -&gt; ()
    write : (File, String) -&gt; File
    let f: File = open()
    let new_f : File = write(f, &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;)
    close(new_f)
</code></pre>
If this seems clumsy or error-prone, notice that you can&#x27;t accidentally close() f instead of new_f, and you can&#x27;t forget to close() new_f, so there is actually very little room for error here."

If you would document them and blog your findings it would be helpful because this is the first I have heard anyone say amazon serves malware."
comment,14250396,,,1493757897,,ajb,"Typical CISC is an instructions which uses both a load&#x2F;store pipeline slot and an ALU pipeline slot. &#x27;move immediate to address&#x27; just uses a load&#x2F;store slot and fits into a normal risc microarchitecture; the reason you don&#x27;t normally get it is encoding constraints: the address typically uses the instruction bits where the immediate would go.<p>Looking at the source, though, this processor uses a variable length instruction; so it is at least a bit CISCy."

Actually, every person on my team rolls their eyes to managers or leads from other teams who don&#x27;t back up their words with actions.<p>Now that I&#x27;m in a higher roll, I notice a lot of people who chameleon their ways right up the chain.

To be fair a lot of this was on relatively early versions.<p>I also found the Ctrl-F breaking and infinite scroll much more annoying than useful and tried to tell them[1] along with others.

comment,14250354,,,1493757589,,shimon,"Actually, this is more like the opposite of how Microsoft has always done things. When they&#x27;ve entered markets, from OS to word processing to RDBMS to web browsers, they&#x27;ve consistently produced simpler, cheaper products. Then they&#x27;ve gradually improved them until they became credible competitors and often dominant choices.<p>With phones, tablets, and now cheap school laptops, their timing didn&#x27;t allow that. Google has already succeeded with the classic Microsoft strategy, all the way down to commoditizing the hardware vendors. Microsoft is instead coming in as a semi-premium option, combined with inertia&#x2F;safety as a brand trusted by enterprises. The same play is a bit more successful in cloud computing, but they&#x27;re still losing to AWS who are nailing the classic Microsoft strategy. Assuming they continue to decline in their ability to rapid-follow in new technology platforms, I expect they&#x27;ll look more and more like Oracle and IBM."

And in the fairly recent past other vendors like Texas Memory systems developed strategies which were all RAM and a bit of cleverness to snapshot to HD when the power fails. The point being that with enough money you could brute force the solution, but now the money required it decreasing and so new strategies are opening up."

comment,14250114,,,1493755785,,oxryly1,"Using Lisp (in the form of Racket) for many years in a production environment, I&#x27;ve observed:<p>1. People do complain about the parentheses but they generally get to work dealing with them right away. It&#x27;s the loudest complaint, but it doesn&#x27;t really even slow people down.<p>2. This is a similar complaint, and does scare people off from jumping in if they have a real choice.<p>3. Racket in particular solves this one to an extent. We&#x27;ve used it with Redis, JSON, MySQL, Perforce, etc etc productively. More commentary below, though...<p>4. This one is a non-issue as far as I&#x27;ve seen. If you hire someone who can program, then can quickly learn and be productive in Lisp.<p>5. This is tied in with 4, a non-issue.<p>6. This is an issue with perception. The problem is more that people believe they know something about Lisp because they&#x27;ve heard of it, and they come in with the expectation that it&#x27;ll be weird or difficult, which is a bit of a speed bump to getting to work right away.<p>Ultimately the biggest issue we&#x27;ve seen is that the broader ecosystem of organizations using Lisp (or Racket) in production environments is missing. As such, there are many sharp corners that you have to file off yourself as you deploy your usage. Useful resources like Stack Overflow just don&#x27;t have the answers prepackaged because it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;re the first to use Perforce to deploy a precompiled version of your Racket application on Windows (for example).<p>It&#x27;s easy to underestimate just how much work people have put into making ecosystems in C++, Java, and Python contain all the pieces, experience, and knowledge you&#x27;ll need to solve your particular problems quickly and effectively.<p>Another pieced missing along with that ecosystem: outside of the implementation of the language itself, no one has taken an application of significant size and age and added a major feature to it. This is something that happens in production all the time -- and it happens on a schedule with a budget. Virtually no one using a small or academically minded languages ever does this, though. And it&#x27;s not until you try that do you discover all those sharp corners and missing support tools and libraries."

comment,14250099,,,1493755687,,dmix,This is the type of innovation we exchange for a sense of absolute security in having highly-vetted decade-long bio R&amp;D and extensive backlogs at the FDA for approvals to sell products on the market. It&#x27;s go big or go home because the regulatory risk&#x2F;timeline is so extensive.<p>Most of these things die quietly or never get started so we never really see the true costs of what it takes to push the pharma world forward. It likely has a big effect on reinforcing existing monopolies as they are the only ones who can play that game (and pharma has been dominated by the same six companies since the 1800s). Usually R&amp;D happens via a single trajectory which is either expensive internal labs at these companies or via anointed universities. There is very little variation on the source.<p>There&#x27;s rarely an investment market between small scale seed stage and high growth phase. Which is where these bio R&amp;D projects die.<p>Maybe there is an opportunity for a YC-style org to disrupt here. But I doubt it given the requirements to get to market.

Apple later revealed in 2017 that the thermal core design had limited the ability to upgrade the Mac Pro&#x27;s GPUs and that a new design was under development, to be released in 2018 or 2019.&quot;<p>Either it took them a year to figure out the problems with the current design and realize they needed to go back to the drawing board, or (I&#x27;m guessing) it was just allowed to languish and no serious investigation was done until fairly recently.<p>(Take all this with a pinch of salt, of course! I&#x27;m a random internet pundit and not actually running one of the most successful businesses of all time.)"

comment,14250039,,,1493755317,,no_protocol,"I wondered what this meant:<p>&gt; Consistent with the provisions of the FedEx Service Guide, the money-back guarantee is not in effect for FedEx Express packages due for delivery on May 2, 2017.<p>So I found the section &quot;Money-Back Guarantee Policy&quot; in the Service Guide.  There are several sections describing the guarantee and a list of specific limitations and exceptions, one of which is:<p>&gt; 2. The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.<p>And in the Liabilities Not Assumed section, the end of item D states:<p>&gt; disruption or failure of communication and information systems (including, but not limited to, our systems).<p>---<p>After all that digging, I went back to the very first paragraph of the Money-Back &quot;Guarantee&quot;, which states:<p>&gt; We offer a money-back guarantee for our services. This guarantee can be suspended, modified or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.<p>1. Why do they even need to list all the exceptions and limitations if the &quot;guarantee&quot; can be revoked for any reason?<p>2. Why is the word &quot;Guarantee&quot; used in the name of the policy? It seems deceptive to offer a promise that essentially means nothing.<p>I&#x27;d rather see it called a &quot;Money-Back Policy&quot; and have it only list the specific cases where it <i>does</i> apply.  At least then the customers would have a better idea of what they were buying.  It is too hard to figure out what does and does not apply when only negatives are listed."

This is the fastest possible way to write data to the SSD, period. This method also creates the simplest possible FTL mapping table.<p>Random reads and writes are significantly slower if you write everything from one thread. To speed everything up you should write in parallel (for example using Linux AIO + O_DIRECT, or libuv + O_DIRECT). OS level buffering and many OS threads will deliver good random write throughput as well.<p>There are other effects to consider, e.g. read-write interference."

When you get down to making a decision among the top few from any crop of candidates it really is a coin flip.<p>Every engineer at Facebook likes to think that they are there because they are &#x27;the best of the best&#x27;, but having sat through far more hiring reviews at Facebook than I ever thought I would have to put up, with the simple fact is that for every person you see walking around the campus there were two or three other people who the job offer could have just as easily gone to were it not for a whole host of non-code&#x2F;non-dev reasons; these reasons can range from gender to the sloppy handwriting on the whiteboard to the fact that when I came in to do your manager interview I happened to be a little annoyed that the cafe had run out of lox for my morning bagel.<p>In my experience, the least qualified female engineers I encountered were more qualified than the lower quartile of male engineers and they worked a hell of a lot harder to boot."
comment,14249892,,,1493754371,,ahartman00,"At a previous job, we talked a lot about managing the expectations of clients.  If you promise someone an operating system delivered in two weeks, with a budget of $10k, they will be very upset when you don&#x27;t deliver.  It doesnt matter that it was an unrealistic promise.  This is why engineers should double their estimates, and be proactive about communicating delays.  People do not like to be disappointed when their expectations are not met.<p>I think that&#x27;s what is happening here.  People are expecting wildlife photos to be shot in the wild.  A studio, or feeding the animals feels like a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; or fake product.  So they are upset.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if the footage is representative, or if the photos were of a better quality than what could be obtained in nature.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if baiting the animals reduces the cost of making the documentary, potentially increasing the amount of footage we can view. Their expectations were not met.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before, and probably will have to say it again.  We are not logical creatures.  We can expect people to behave logically, but we will be disappointed.

comment,14249880,,,1493754276,,a_d,"Jan is the entrepreneur that I admire the most. Here are some of the reasons:<p>1. He was so focused on building the product that he just ignored all emails from carriers and investors. Sequoia partners had to hunt down Whatsapp&#x27;s office just to get in touch with him. Most entrepreneurs would be easily distracted by investor attention.<p>2. He didn&#x27;t care about the press (despite a ton of inbound interest). I don&#x27;t know how or why he could resist the temptation, but he did for a long time. In fact at one point he tried to consciously stay out of press because he wanted to &quot;manage&quot; growth and didn&#x27;t want competitors to get wind.<p>3. Very balanced outlook towards global users - even though SV (or even US) didn&#x27;t recognize their traction, he always understood that there is a big world out there where not everyone has an iPhone.<p>4. Focus on infrastructure and reliability.<p>5. Focus on being &quot;lean&quot;. For a long time the team was quite small - but the thing I find most telling is the fact that he didn&#x27;t have &quot;business people&quot; for a long time - anyone who didn&#x27;t build the product. At acquisiton I think they had a GC and a business operations guy.

comment,14249877,,,1493754262,,pvnick,"You&#x27;re right - government officials (not necessarily corrupt even) write legislation influenced by lobbyists who are hired by the big guys to protect their own interests. All legislation is influenced by lobbyists. It&#x27;s just the name of the game. More legislation and regulation generally has the opposite effect of getting in the way of innovation and market efficiency.<p>Regarding sustainable energy - a lot of government funding is already going to that in the form of research grants awarded to people in academia looking at those things. We can increase funding, but that&#x27;s already happening. The surest way to kill those chances would be, for example, create a carbon tax which has the effects of getting government dependent on revenue coming from fossil fuel emissions, and introduces incentives to ensure that revenue source continues.<p>Regarding your last question - I don&#x27;t know. Haven&#x27;t done the research. But I have read enough of classical economics to know that it&#x27;s probably not a big deal - or if it is an issue that it will be short-lived. If the consumer is sufficiently fucked then it is the corporation who will have shot themselves in the foot. Law of supply and demand in action"

comment,14249826,,,1493753890,,lisper,"&gt; 1 - All those parenthesis. (Still a top objection)<p>If you actually count parens fairly you will find that Lisp has no more than any other language, it&#x27;s just that other languages use a mix of parens, square brackets and curly braces whereas Lisp only uses parens.  Also, if you really don&#x27;t like parens, you can get rid of a lot of them using macros.  See e.g.:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rongarret&#x2F;ergolib"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rongarret&#x2F;ergolib</a><p>and in particular the binding-block (BB) construct.<p>&gt; 2 - Lisp doesn&#x27;t look like or work like what I&#x27;m used to.<p>Neither does anything else until you get used to it.<p>&gt; 3 - Lisp doesn&#x27;t have as many libraries as the most popular mainstream programming languages.<p>That used to be one of my objections, but it&#x27;s simply not true any more.  And with Quicklisp accessing the (very large) collection of available libraries is incredibly convenient.  (Thanks Zach!)<p>&gt; 4 - There aren&#x27;t nearly as many Lisp programmers, so it&#x27;ll be hard to find more to join your project&#x2F;company if you use Lisp.<p>That becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  But it&#x27;s no harder to create new Lisp programmers than it is to create new X programmers for any other value of X.<p>&gt; 5 - There aren&#x27;t nearly as many Lisp jobs, so why bother learning Lisp if you&#x27;re going to have a hard time finding work using it?<p>Because knowing Lisp is a huge lever for learning other languages.  Once you know Lisp everything else becomes a lot easier to learn (but a lot more frustrating too because now you will be aware of the shortcomings of other languages).<p>&gt; 6 - Lisp is ancient, and anything that old is useless and primitive compared to new and shiny languages.<p>Chasing the shiny new thing is usually a mistake.  Most old things suck simply because most things suck in general.  But the things that don&#x27;t suck continue to not suck even after they become old.  In fact, standing the test of time is one of the defining characteristics of non-sucky things."

I would also note that there are tenX (plus) refactorers who can freely cut large amounts of code from large projects without risk, too.<p>If you started tackling mathematical puzzles when you were eight, and programming a couple years later you&#x27;re a different species than someone who switched majors to computing in third year for financial reasons; the early starter&#x27;s brain is actually physically different (for instance some of your visual cortex and memory will now likely be devoted to math and logic instead of geography, this has been measured in chess players.) Same with a concert pianist vs someone who started playing the piano at age 20. Sure, the environment of the concert hall or practice hall matters - just not nearly that much.<p>I agree we do need to spend more time paying off boring technical debt, too; though that&#x27;s not getting much more popular.<p>I don&#x27;t want to leave the wrong impression. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with doing a very conscientious job of coding and recoding that a whole lot of others could also do, just with a better ethic and constant attention to detail - we need many more such coders too, and I honor them very much."

comment,14249793,,,1493753636,,Joeri,"It wasn&#x27;t microsoft that killed the margins, it was amazon. Back in the DOS, windows 3.x and even windows 9x era the OS was just as commoditized, yet people willingly paid high margins. They did this because they wanted the service of their local PC store and therefore were willing to pay their margins. With the boom of online stores and easy exchanges&#x2F;returns the brick and mortar stores went away and with them went the cushy margins.<p>The thing that really doomed the PC market was not that the easy margins went away, it&#x27;s that OEM&#x27;s responded by making their products worse. They cut hardware quality, they bundled crapware. The PC experience got worse year after year. Truthfully, windows 8 did not help, but I still think that if the OEM&#x27;s had just bundled touch screens across the board it would not have been such an outright disaster. The reduced quality forced people off the platform, to macs at the high end, and to chromebooks at the low end. Granted, mobile would have always caused PC sales to decline, but not as much as they did. It is only recently that the OEM&#x27;s have started investing again in quality hardware with a pure windows experience, and unsurprisingly last quarter PC sales went up YoY for the first time in five years."

Not moving forward with the HIV cure?<p>The field&#x27;s challenges right now in terms of STIs are addressed with more advocacy, outreach, screening, education, etc. Treatment is phenomenally effective currently for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, etc. Antibiotic resistance has been seen in some of those, sure, and will likely increase, but we deal with that as it comes -- just as we have with every other resistant pathogen. I&#x27;m not eager to keep a life-long and fatal STI around (HIV) to try to forestall that outcome.<p>Also: Those sources don&#x27;t really support your claims. They describe an explosion of STDs that (at least as posited in those articles) are tied to decreased public health funding. There is indeed lots of discussion around risk compensation in light of improved HIV treatment, PrEP, HCV treatment, etc, but the data&#x27;s a little unclear, and in my view is irrelevant to whether we should actually find and provide cures."

comment,14249733,,,1493753195,,danharaj,"Jean-Yves Girard, a great logician, also has a lot of quarrels to pick with analytic philosophy. His prose is idiosyncratic, lyrical and definitely at odds with the dryness of &quot;logic of the 20th century&quot;. If you like the idea of an energetic approach to reconceptualize philosophy, in particular the philosophy of logic, I recommend reading Girard&#x27;s work. The Blind Spot: Lectures on Logic is an organized survey of logic starting with Hilbert&#x27;s formalism and ending up in the operator algebras of Geometry of Interaction. Along the way, Girard&#x27;s combative, highly opinionated and witty commentary ceaselessly entertains and engages.<p>Perhaps what is most striking about Girard in contrast to Nozick is how he manages to be very rigorous and artful simultaneously. Something as abstract of logic becomes a living creature when Girard talks about it. To see logic this way is to expect it to flourish in subordination to the rest of human experience, not languish in its own obscure enclave, ceaselessly chasing its own tail, reducing the alluring to the banal."

comment,14249676,,,1493752832,,derekp7,"From what I understand, there is the concern that potential new technologies wouldn&#x27;t be allowed under a strict interpretation of net neutrality.  For a hypothetical example: go back in time when voice over IP first came on the scene.  At that time there wasn&#x27;t enough excess bandwidth to guarantee voice packets would arrive on time.  Now you could prioritize voice traffic, but you&#x27;d have to either charge a fee, or find a way to positively identify voice data (otherwise everyone would turn on the voice QOS flag in all their apps even if they didn&#x27;t need it).  This would then not be net neutral.<p>Of course, today there is enough excessive bandwidth that voice traffic doesn&#x27;t need to be prioritized.  But what about an application where an expert doctor is controlling a robotic surgical instrument from cross country?  Would a special service class for those packets be allowed under net neutrality laws?<p>But the real reason, is that as soon as there is additional bandwidth available, technology finds a way to consume all of it and then some.  So the ISPs want to be able to de-prioritize some heavy bandwidth users (such as bittorrent), and&#x2F;or give higher priority to traffic with paying users like Netflix (for a toll fee, of course), or their own video services."

The days of dev throwing code over the wall to ops is long gone.<p>Here&#x27;s where we&#x27;re in violent agreement. I believe the best way to ensure that the pager doesn&#x27;t go off at 2am is to give that duty to developers. Far and away the most likely reason for a production issue is new code that went live. No matter how good communication is within an organization, ops will never have the same context for issues like this that dev will. So dev being the tip of the spear with regard to incident response will result in faster resolution. The job of ops is to be an enabler of this responsibility. They should be building tooling and infrastructure that makes it easy for dev to do the right thing but doesn&#x27;t force decisions on dev. Ops is an abstraction layer that gives developers higher-level primitives for infrastructure that allows them to solve the customer problems more easily.<p>But there&#x27;s no substitute for the dual benefit that you get from a) oh...I wonder if this problem is related to that change I reviewed yesterday and b) hmm...I&#x27;ve got pager duty this weekend, so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t just LGTM this PR.

comment,14249433,,,1493751386,,vilhelm_s,"Incidentally, I think comparing the elisp and the Scheme versions is instructive because it shows how much is going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; in this lecture. Abelson and Sussman made it all seem natural and effortless, but the key ideas in this 1983 lecture come from Sussman and Steele&#x27;s research on Scheme in the late 1970s.<p>The blog post author marveled that the compiler could optimize <i>all</i> tail-calls, which was a new emphasis of Scheme (earlier Lisps only did a best-effort job), and which required e.g. changing the function calling conventions.<p>He appreciated how the definition of derivatives looks like the mathematical definition; but it only looks this clean because of Scheme&#x27;s choice to have a single namespace for functions and values (1-Lisp versus 2-Lisp), so we get rid of elisp&#x27;s setq&#x2F;funcall&#x2F;#&#x27; cruft.<p>And he wondered if the substitution model (which lets you think about programs like high school algebra, instead of modelling the execution in detail) could really always work. But it only works because of Scheme&#x27;s choice to use lexical binding and closures.<p>All of these were difficult design problems at the time, and different Lisps explored different choices. We really have Scheme to thank for a lot of programming language concepts which we take for granted nowadays."

One time I spoke to the owner about the business economics. They try to buy complete kits. It is not economical to re-create kits from parts if you sort manually. When they buy unsorted Lego collections from collectors&#x2F;enthusiasts, they do a limited manual sort to pull out the most valuable pieces and then they store the leftovers. When I spoke to her, I believe she said she had 2 storage units filled with Lego that aren&#x27;t economical to sort further. Run-of-the-mill bricks and pieces have no value other than scrap. The value is primarily in mini-figs and rare specialty pieces like clear acrylic canopies. Obviously, kits are valuable, but only if you don&#x27;t have to create them by manually sorting. Also, used kits are much more valuable if they are sold already assembled as proof that all of the pieces are included. This assembly labor must be factored into the business model.<p>Buying lots off of Ebay, it seems like you risk buying presorted Lego which have already been picked over for the most valuable pieces."

It also turns out Cap&#x27;n Proto reduces the building cost by a fair amount, because the arena-style allocation needed to support zero-copy output also happens to be a lot cheaper and more cache-friendly, but that&#x27;s somewhat of an accident.<p>For message-passing scenarios, Cap&#x27;n Proto is an incremental improvement over Protobufs -- faster, but still O(n), since you have to build the messages. For loading large data files from disk, though, Cap&#x27;n Proto is a paradigm shift, allowing O(1) random access."

I blame excess regulation!<p>There were three basic reasons for the super-fast growth of internet in the 90s, which I remember quite well as I was making a good living selling computers and networking services.<p>1. It got way easier to use. When I first got onto the internet it was (almost) all text-based and unix-like, and conceptually difficult for many people to get to grips with, until someone invented a thing called a &#x27;web browser&#x27; that regular people could figure out more easily.<p>2. No taxes on internet business, which had nothing to do with net neutrality but led to a stampede of people looking to make a quick buck <i>and</i> keep more of it than they would in other lines of business.<p>3. there was huge market potential because lots of people  in developed countries had enough disposable income to own a computer, and modems were relatively affordable. Lots of people were doing peer-to-peer networking or running bulletin boards. If you wanted to start an internet company int eh 1990s all you needed was enough capital to rent a T1 line and a buy a or lease some network switching equipment (which was also becoming suddenly affordable with the growth of ethernet), and people would use your service because there weren&#x27;t that many services out there.<p>I wrote a book for consumers on how to use the exciting new world of the internet back in 1995.

comment,14249049,,,1493749167,,naravara,"&gt;I&#x27;m racking my brain trying to figure out what&#x27;s stopping chains from replicating this.<p>Scale.<p>Anything living has a level of variability and likelihood of failure&#x2F;damage&#x2F;spoilage to it that gets harder and harder to manage as your scale gets bigger.<p>When you&#x27;re a small shopkeeper who sells about 3 baskets of apples a day, it&#x27;s both easier to sift through it and throw out the bad ones AND easier to find 3 basket&#x27;s worth of apples that meet your quality expectations.<p>When you have to move 3 pallet-loads of apples, though, not only does QC become a more complicated endeavor, but you have to find 3 pallet-loads of apples to sell at a competitive price, so you may not have the luxury of being so choosy. When pallet-loads scale up to shipping-containers. . . you can see where I&#x27;m going with this.<p>And then there are logistics issues. If you&#x27;re a large retailer you have to bring everything into centralized warehouses and then send them out. This means things need to travel longer distances and&#x2F;or have longer shelf-lives. The upshot of that is they have a higher chance of either being past their prime by the time they get to you, or that had to get picked before they were properly ripened on the vine.<p>When you&#x27;re smaller, have smaller scale suppliers, and less complicated distribution networks a lot of that extra burden falls away. Starbucks had this problem when they first started to get big too. A lot of people give them flack for over-roasting their beans and giving everything a charred&#x2F;muddied flavor. When they were small they were able to be choosier about the beans. As they grew the scuttlebutt is that there just weren’t enough beans of that quality level on the market, so they had to lower the quality threshold and move to darker roasts. They still sell better beans, but only in select locations."

It&#x27;s a very useful abstraction, but it&#x27;s also limited. In reality all these blobs are jammed together and moving around, creating a lot of random noise in the system. This is because every component in a cell is working at nano-scale (proteins are to a 1st approximation about 5nm in diameter). The rules are different at that scale, we don&#x27;t experience anything like them in our daily lives.<p>In other words, the components of the cell aren&#x27;t doing chemistry at a bench, passing the results of one reaction to the next reaction, it&#x27;s more like doing chemistry in a mosh pit.<p>Biology has developed coping mechanisms for this insanity, but analogies drawn with things like computer processors and macro-world items are going to be somewhat wrong because of the inherent differences in scale."

Simply moving redundant code into an include file and getting rid off all of the cases where they were looping over some massive cross product looking for a record ID was good for ~4 orders of magnitude response time reduction and allowed completing about half the functionality for a net negative 90% lines of code.<p>Given how many clients that company had, the main conclusion I draw is that as an industry focusing on helping the .1x people improve is more likely to make a noticeable difference than chasing the other end of the spectrum."

The problem is finding a endpoint who wants to buy it at wholesale.<p>The problem is that like anything in corporate American business models, scaling up doesn&#x27;t always scale. As groceries have consolidated, you need to focus everything on industrial agriculture to deliver a consistent product.<p>So as a society, we do stupid things like growing lettuce in the desert and flying it across a continent while fertile land down the road goes fallow. But when you have 5,000 wal-marts to stock, it makes more sense to focus on a few big suppliers than a bunch of little ones. I purchased lettuce in February grown in upstate NY in the middle of winter -- for 50% less than stuff in the market.<p>It&#x27;s one of the massive inefficiencies that drives me nuts about the current American mutation of capitalism."

It does so, apparently, by examining historical data, looking at the outcomes of other people who match the defendant&#x27;s profile, and on the basis of that information providing a probability score.<p>As I mentioned in my comment on that post, it is entirely inappropriate to use an algorithm that, at best, predicts only <i>aggregate risk</i> to impute individual risk, especially when that probability is being used to determine something as serious as a prison sentence.<p>And as this TechCrunch piece points out, it&#x27;s not just this specialized software that has potentially undesirable consequences, but the everyday algorithms used by Google, etc.<p>One thing that would help is transparency.  But we are very quickly getting to a point where lack of transparency is not merely a business decision, but a problem inherent in the technology we&#x27;re using.  A machine-learning model might not be easily interpretable.  Its own creators might not be able to fully understand why it&#x27;s making the decisions it&#x27;s making.<p>We may soon get to an uncomfortable place where certain technologies are effective, but nevertheless must be avoided because the cost of making them sufficiently tunable to address ethical and regulatory requirements becomes prohibitive."

comment,14248773,,,1493747698,,paulmd,"There&#x27;s really only a handful of things that I dread doing during a computer build.<p>One is attaching the CPU power connector, since in many cases it&#x27;s absolutely JAMMED against the top of the case&#x2F;a fan&#x2F;etc.  Getting it off is even more of a nightmare, if you ever need to change the PSU.  I changed a PSU last week and spent a half hour trying to open the latch with a screwdriver while tugging on the wires (and hoping I didn&#x27;t rip them out).  I tried needlenose pliers, couldn&#x27;t get a grip on that stupid smooth plastic connector body.<p>The worst, though, is attaching those stupid 1-pin jumper sockets for the power switch&#x2F;the LEDs&#x2F;etc.  HOW IN THE WORLD has nobody standardized that connector block and turned it into a single pluggable unit like the AC97&#x2F;HD Audio connector?"

comment,14248767,,,1493747674,,xatan_dank,"I don&#x27;t even agree with your first sentence.  I don&#x27;t see anything in this article about how we should collectively stop blocking ads in order to encourage better practices from publishers&#x2F;advertisers&#x2F;ad networks.  The article is just a long rant about how bad ads are with the promise that &quot;if they get better I will look at them&quot;.<p>How are you going to be able to make this judgment call?  It&#x27;s already known that ad services track users and occasionally install malware on their machines.  Will the ads simply become more pleasant-looking while becoming more nefarious, or will they actually be more respectful of users&#x27; freedoms?  How will you know which is occurring?  Also, are you seriously going to stop blocking ads periodically to see if you should keep blocking ads?  I think asking the ad networks to be more polite is more than a little naive.<p>Even if the article was actually encouraging people to work with the ad networks to find a reasonable common ground it would be severely misguided."

comment,14248710,,,1493747373,,TheRealDunkirk,"The pricing is one thing I don&#x27;t understand.

The line we&#x27;ve been fed from Microsoft&#x27;s marketing team is that the &quot;convertibility&quot; of the Surface line is what everyone wanted, and what made it better than any Apple product in every way. Now, they&#x27;re back to a plain, old laptop configuration? Is this an admission of defeat? Have Surface sales flat-lined?

Also, AIOs usually have the cheapest parts available (pumps&#x2F;fans) and are lower quality than you would get from a (much more expensive) custom setup."

comment,14248659,,,1493747120,,kazinator,"I&#x27;m working on FFI for TXR Lisp. Until this morning, it was in the stage of &quot;collection of working API functions, written in C, exposed with Lisp bindings&quot;.<p>I have almost everything I want working, including callbacks. There is a decently rich type system which supports pointers that annotate data passing directions for automatic malloc and free, and this works in both directions: out calls and callbacks (closures).<p>I support by-value passing and returning of structures.
And also of C arrays! Even though C doesn&#x27;t have by-value arrays. You see, my FFI type (array 42 int) is actually equivalent to the C type struct __anon { int __anon[42] } and not the C type int [42].<p>Just this morning, between 6 and 6:45 a.m I wrote a partial implementation of the FFI declaration language. Here is what it looks like, with actual output:<p>Load the under-construction FFI macros:<p><pre><code>  (load &quot;ffi&quot;)
</code></pre>
Define a show macro for showing an an expression and its value as expr -&gt; value:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro show (expr)
    (let ((val (gensym)))
      ^(let ((,val ,expr))
         (format t &quot;~s -&gt; ~!~s\n&quot; &#x27;,expr ,val)
         ,val)))
  </code></pre>
Now the FFI test. Some structures we need, and declarations of FFI typedefs for them giving type info. The above typedefs aren&#x27;t required; we we could just write out the (struct ...) syntax inline in the later FFI declarations.<p><pre><code>  ;; Lisp struct representing C struct ldiv
  (defstruct ldiv nil quot rem)
  ;; FFI typedef for it
  (deffi-type ldiv (struct ldiv (quot long) (rem long)))
  
  (defstruct pipe nil rfd wfd)
  (deffi-type pipe (struct pipe (rfd int) (wfd int)))
  
  (defstruct dirent nil
    ino off)
  (deffi-type dirent (struct dirent
                             (ino int)
                             (off int)
                             (nil (array 62 int))))
                             ;; the member named nil here is anonymous padding
</code></pre>
Now, declare some FFI functions. Very succinct and expressive:<p><pre><code>  (with-dyn-lib (libc &quot;libc.so.6&quot;)
    (deffi c-abs &quot;abs&quot; int (int))
    (deffi ldiv &quot;ldiv&quot; ldiv (long long))
    (deffi c-getenv &quot;getenv&quot; (buf 3) (str))
    (deffi c-getenv-2 &quot;getenv&quot; str (str))
    (deffi wcslen &quot;wcslen&quot; ulong (wstr))
    ;; Two ways to call pipe: using a pointer to two-int
    ;; structure, or an int[2] array. They are binary identical.
    (deffi c-pipe &quot;pipe&quot; int ((ptr-out pipe)))
    (deffi c-pipe-2 &quot;pipe&quot; int ((ptr-out (array 2 int))))
    (deffi c-read &quot;read&quot; int (int buf int))
    (deffi c-read-str &quot;read&quot; int (int (ptr (array 10 char)) int))
    (deffi opendir &quot;opendir&quot; cptr (str))
    (deffi readdir-r &quot;readdir_r&quot; int (cptr (ptr-out dirent) (ptr-out cptr))))

</code></pre>
Finally, the test: with two lines of interactive input from the TTY to satsify two read calls from file descriptor 0. For both of these, I enter the text abc[Enter]:<p><pre><code>  (show (c-abs -42))
  (show (ldiv 47 6))
  (show (c-getenv &quot;HOME&quot;))
  (show (c-getenv-2 &quot;HOME&quot;))
  (show (wcslen &quot;foo bar&quot;))
  (let ((pi (new pipe)))
    (show pi)
    (show (c-pipe pi))
    (show pi))
  (let ((pi (vector 2)))
    (show pi)
    (show (c-pipe-2 pi))
    (show pi))
  (let ((buf (make-buf 5 #xa0)))
    (show buf)
    (show (c-read 0 buf (length-buf buf)))
    (show buf))
  (let ((str &quot;xxxxxxxxxxx&quot;))
    (show str)
    (show (c-read-str 0 str 10))
    (show str))
  
  (let* ((de (new dirent))
         (dp (cptr 0))
         (dir (show (opendir &quot;.&quot;))))
    (show (readdir-r dir de dp))
    (show de)
    (show dp))
</code></pre>
Output:<p><pre><code>  (c-abs -42) -&gt; 42
  (ldiv 47 6) -&gt; #S(ldiv quot 7 rem 5)
  (c-getenv &quot;HOME&quot;) -&gt; #b&#x27;2f686f&#x27;

  de -&gt; #S(dirent ino 669944 off 1)
  dp -&gt; #&lt;cptr: a32a258&gt;

</code></pre>
Look what is happening in (c-read-str 0 str 10).  We pass in a Lisp string which contains &quot;xxxxx...&quot;. Magically, it becomes &quot;abc\nxxxxxx...&quot; after the read, as if we were working in C.  This is because the type for the parameter (ptr (array 10 char)). The FFI framework recognizes arrays of char and makes them correspond to strings in a two-way manner."

comment,14248629,,,1493746928,,FiatLuxDave,"Taleyarkhan&#x27;s failures alone shouldn&#x27;t rule out a concept, agreed.  A bigger problem is that although sonofusion does appear capable of creating small plasmas which in theory could be hot and dense enough for fusion, the amount of time during which the plasma remains at that temperature and density seems to be too small. In other words, there seems to be insufficient containment.<p>A common misconception about fusion is that containment is all about keeping the particles from leaving.  But often, it is more about keeping the energy from leaving.  A momentum-based containment design like sonofusion uses is subject to Rayleigh instabilities which carry the energy away in fast moving particles."

We built a software platform that can handle the huge amounts of data now available. We developed a powerful collection of processing and analytic capabilities. Our customers are able to ask very deep questions of their data, and get their answers quickly.<p>From the beginning, we recognized that data could drive social, as well as commercial, value. For example:<p>* Producing and distributing clean energy is easier and cheaper if we can instrument wind farms, solar collectors and transmission networks, and continuously optimize them.
* There are seven billion people in the world today, but the population will grow to nine billion by the year 2050. We must feed two billion more people but won’t find much new arable farmland. If we can analyze data on soil chemistry, model weather accurately and select the varieties of seeds best suited to produce in those conditions, we can increase crop yields.
* Genetic analysis, both of patients and of the diseases that afflict them, provides a rich toolbox for interfering with disease onset and progression, and offers the hope of designing new drugs that can cure many varieties of cancer in our lifetimes.<p>Cloudera was also started &quot;because we believe that data makes things that are impossible today, possible tomorrow. There’s more data coming, and there are plenty of impossible things to work on. Our journey is only well begun.&quot; ~Mike Olson, Cloudera CSO<p>If you would like to join us on this exciting journey, check out the possibilities on our website-&quot;There are plenty of impossible things still to be done.&quot;<p>To learn more &amp; apply for our current openings in the US, Asia-Pacific, Latin America,and Europe&#x2F;Middle East&#x2F;Africa, check us out here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;Pm87Mj"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;Pm87Mj</a>"

People attempt to measure their 10xness in comparison to the worst engineer they know or work with (which is really likely comparing a 2x engineer to a 0.2 engineer). We have no way of evaluating it. No good way of hiring for it. The majority of actual 10x engineers don&#x27;t get paid like it (they&#x27;re just known as that really good engineer on the team &#x2F; company). People spend time writing about it, and reading about it to no real benefit.<p>It really is the ultimate programmer insecurity. If Cosmo made a magazine for programmers it would likely be their splashy headline every other week.<p>The reason I mention it, is that it&#x27;s wasted effort even thinking about it.

It also does a fantastic job generating efficient queries due to the way it forces you to structure your models. The `F`, `Q`, and aggregation functions are top-notch as well. If none of the ORM features suit you for a particular query, Django ORM allows you to write the raw query yourself in a secure manner. Couple this with the Migration system, and I doubt you&#x27;ll find a better ORM suite anywhere else.<p>I find Python has some of the best ORMs out there between Django ORM, SQLAlchemy, Peewee, and Pony."

So you can track the origins of TensorFlow to 2010 or before, and for sure it wasn&#x27;t developed for 1 person. It could start as a 5 person project and now probably it is more than a hundred (aiming very low). If you add on top of it all the research done where they have been collecting ideas, then you realize the amount of knowledge behind TensorFlow is huge.

comment,14248332,,,1493745451,,scriptkiddy,"&gt; The pervasive use of artificial keys. USE NATURAL KEYS. Unfortunately probably 99% of real-world databases were designed with artificial keys. I wish I could point to some literature on this topic. It is very rare and I only came to learn about this from a DBA who is well-versed in designing with natural keys. I&#x27;m trying to get him to publish more on this topic.<p>While I really enjoy the concept of Natural Keys, I just see so few places where they are applicable. If I was designing a banking Db schema, I could see using an account number as a primary key as long as I am not exposing my Db to anything but internal systems. However, if I&#x27;m designing a social networking platform, what can I use as a natural primary key for a user object? I can&#x27;t use a name because not all names are unique and they can change. I can&#x27;t use an email because they can change and I feel like Email addresses can get pretty large(more space and slower lookups). I could maybe use a username if I enforce that a username can never change and must be unique. But, we then run into the same issues as emails where a username can be fairly long and thus cause slower lookups. I also don&#x27;t like the idea of using strings as primary keys either because I would need to take into account implementation details like string encoding (utf8, utf16, utf32, ascii, latin-1) and make sure to encode&#x2F;decode on every lookup&#x2F;insert.<p>So, I can see some use cases where natural primary keys make sense. However, I believe that for most use cases, artificial keys are a better choice. Integers don&#x27;t take up a lot of space, it&#x27;s easy to enforce uniqueness, they are a natural sequence, and they rarely, if ever need to change[1].<p>[1] In fact, I would make the argument that if you&#x27;re altering primary keys at all, you&#x27;re doing something wrong."

comment,14248299,,,1493745233,,paulmd,"The HEDT chips have very low stock clocks but they overclock really well.<p>Broadwell is kind of an exception here since it clocks so poorly both in the small-chip and HEDT form.  But for example, 4.7 GHz is a good OC for Small Haswell and the Haswell-E HEDT chips will usually go to at least 4.5 GHz.<p>(of course the major caveat here is power - a highly OC&#x27;d 8-10 core chip can easily pull 200-250 watts package TDP on a normal workload, 300+ watts as measured at the wall.  For an AVX-heavy workload like Prime95, add another 100 watts package TDP.)<p>So overall the penalty for using HEDT chips is nowhere near as big as you are implying here.  It&#x27;s something on the order of 4% loss of single-thread performance to go from 4-core to 8-10 cores.  It just doesn&#x27;t come that way out of the box - largely because anyone who buys a 10-core gaming chip for $1700 knows exactly how to do all this.<p>The bigger problem is that the HEDT chips are 2 generations behind the smaller chips.  Broadwell vs Broadwell-E, the numbers look fine, but Kabylake has some IPC improvements and clocks significantly higher than Broadwell does.<p>This is one of those things that actually <i>can</i> be blamed on &quot;Intel being lazy because they have no real competition&quot;.  They could certainly push the HEDT chips out a little faster instead of waiting to work out all the bugs in the smaller chips, it would just be a bit riskier for them."

* Lisp does actually work a lot like stuff you are used to: evaluation of argument expressions to argument values, which are passed by value: much like C or Java. Functions return a value or multiple values.<p>It has familiar features like mutable lexical and global variables, control constructs for selection and iteration and so on. There is even a form of goto.<p>Aggregate objects like structures, class instances, lists, vectors and so on are actually referential values, like in many languages.<p>It is said that Javascript is a dialect of Lisp. If you understand how Javascript evaluates expressions, that goes a long way toward Lisp. Ruby is sometimes called MatzLisp, after the surname of its creator, for very good reasons. Lisp has inspired many features found in other languages. The comma, ?:, &amp;&amp; and || operators in C appear to be Lisp inspired, as is the very idea of &quot;expression statements&quot;: for instance when we call a function in C as a statement, it is an expression with a value, which is discarded, just like in Lisp.<p>Lisp lists lack encapsulation; they are not opaque bags with which you do things like (add list item). That takes getting used to: always capturing the result value of a list construction. It doesn&#x27;t take that much getting used to for programmers coming from C, who understand a bunch of ways of representing lists, including representations in which a null pointer represents an empty list.<p>A container-like list data type is easily written in Lisp, either as a function-based ADT with a couple of functions around small state struct (or perhaps cons cell or vector), or full blown OOP."

comment,14248167,,,1493744530,,eggie5,"You see this a lot in the context of building a regression and often times the assumptions are violated:<p>* Linear relationship between predictor and response and no multicollinearity
* No auto-correlation (statistical independence of the errors)
* Homoscedasticity (constant variance) of the errors
* Normality of the residual(error) distribution.<p>As the paper suggests, plotting the data visually will help you avoid these assumptions, but also just making sure you don&#x27;t violate the assumptions w&#x2F; statistical tests would work too. For example, uou can look at your residuals (loss) as an indicator of good fit. If your residuals do not follow a normal distribution, this is typically a warning sign that your R2 score is dubious.<p>There are a few statistical tests for Residual Normality, particularly, the Jaque-Bara test is common and available in scipy.<p>So, I would argue, you don&#x27;t even need to visualize the data.

All ads should be blocked and web services which rely on them should find a better way of sustaining themselves profitably.<p>The malicious nature of ads is not new.  Ads have always been infested with malware, tracking, and hideous graphics.  Taken to their logical extreme (as Facebook has done), ads can also manipulate users to a degree far more dangerous than a TV or radio ad could.  Ads are just the surface of a much deeper problem with the Internet, which is that most massive web services are paid for with user data rather than a mutually agreed upon price.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, there is no reason to willingly view an advertisement to support a useful service.  This amounts to a donation which you are not really in control of.  Just circumvent the ad and buy from the company or send them money if you value their services."

comment,14248119,,,1493744226,,scriptkiddy,"&gt; There is a perception amongst lower programmers that FKs are only a thing you enable in production, that they are an impediment to rapid iteration.<p>Really? I&#x27;ve been working as a web programmer for about 5 years now. I use the term Web Programmer because I feel like the term Web Developer carries with it the connotation that you only work with Javascript.<p>My specialty is definitely with Python and more specifically with Django. Django&#x27;s ORM is the first ORM I ever used. Maybe it&#x27;s because I self taught, but I never had the inclination that FKs were an impediment to rapid iteration. In fact, quite the opposite. FKs are a fantastic way to enforce relationship constraints between tables&#x2F;objects&#x2F;models&#x2F;whatever you want to call them.<p>Whenever I start on a new project, the first thing I do is start defining my data structure. In Django, this mostly involves using the ORM layer to define <i>Model Classes</i>. I usually define the core sets of models necessary for the application. As an example, if I were building a simple blog, I&#x27;d start by overriding Django&#x27;s built in user model so I have the flexibility to add columns or place constraints on existing columns. Then I would define the post model which includes an `author` and a `category` FK column. Then I would define the `Category` model. I generate a migration script and run it. Every time I need to make a change to the Schema, I simply add or change whatever I need to and generate a new migration script alongside the old one. These migrations are dependent upon previous migrations and have version numbers. If I need to, I can roll back to a previous schema. Django makes this all very simple and actually separates the migrations out by which <i>app</i> the model definitions reside in. This means that I can make changes to multiple model definitions and only apply the changes to the Db for one of those model classes. It&#x27;s very flexible.<p>So, after my long-winded explanation above, I don&#x27;t see how people could find FKs to be restrictive when there are so many tools like Django&#x27;s ORM and migration system that makes altering your schema so simple."

I think this should give the semantics you&#x27;re looking for (if not the ergonomics). COUNT,SUM,AVG etc should work correctly on the &quot;count&quot; column (btw, I would consider using a different name ;P), and the check+primary key should enforce the constraints.<p>You might add a before update trigger to set count to NULL when count_empty = 1, and hiding the actual table behind a view to hide the internals of the count_key column."

comment,14247834,,,1493742593,,memracom,"It is not the developer that is 10X. It is the environment they work in that is an enabler of 10X productivity. If that environment is also relatively stable, a smart developer can learn all the levers that the environment&#x2F;company provides to them, and start achieving hyper productivity. But move that developer to a different company and they could be a dud. Even just an increase in the instability of the environment can thwart hyper productivity.<p>The focus here is on entirely the wrong thing. It is the development environment provided by the company that enables above average developers to surge into hyper productivity. Good programming practices. Competently prepared requirements. A collegial atmosphere that encourages frank and open communication between departments.<p>Searching for 10X developers is like looking for a silver bullet. Silver bullets do exist in the real world but ask a shooter whether they provide results any better than the common kind of ammo. Mythical stories can be fun but in the real world we have real work to to, real problems to solve, and while you can find shortcuts generally you don&#x27;t find them by looking from them. But dive into the messy chaos of creating order out of nothing, and from time to time you will come across real honest to goodness shortcut opportunities that may provide up to a 10X increase in productivity. Use them if you can, but don&#x27;t waste a lot of energy in chasing them.<p>Also, the idea of a 10X rocket scientist is rather glamourous. But the fact is that there are real opportunities for productivity improvements that are in the boring details, slogging through improvements in processes, making small incremental improvements continuously and consistently. There is more to learn from refactoring than from chasing clouds."

Those that achieve higher academic success also tend to score higher in traits such as delayed gratification and emotional expression control, and a lack of these traits thereby limits upward mobility.

comment,14247696,,,1493741856,,zhan_eg,"Some of my experience and solution to those issues<p>1) UptimeRobot [0] - use to monitor various client websites. The free plan checks every 5 minutes, which should be enough. Notifications can be sent to email, slack, sms and many others. If you think there may be a problem only from some locations make a fast check with [1]. If you suspect DNS issues [2] or [3].<p>2) Again use UptimeRobot for monitoring device publicly accessible from your network. Moreover, if you are in control of your office network, using pfSense [4] notifications when a network gateway goes down works well (still, that works only if you have 2 or more ISPs). Or use a dedicated monitoring device&#x2F;service like Zabbix.<p>3) Using to Twitter to Slack notification, subscribe for updates from both services that you use and major services responsible for Internet backbone. An example is, that using GitLab,  comes with multiple time when the service dies (even that they are improving) - seeing the message in Slack that something is WIP currently by all team members (in a dedicated channel), helps to skip unnecessary debugging [5] :)<p>Not affiliate with any of the service. Still - met the UptimeRobot guys some ago - they are a small startup based in Malta, are very cool and have very stable service :)<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uptimerobot.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uptimerobot.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.super-ping.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.super-ping.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatsmydns.net&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatsmydns.net&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnschecker.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnschecker.org&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.pfsense.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Gateway_Settings#Gateway_Settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.pfsense.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Gateway_Settings#Gateway_S...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gitlabstatus"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gitlabstatus</a>"

Let&#x27;s make an exception for Netflix. What if a new competitor blahflix got popular quickly, Does its traffic get blocked?<p>Well, presumably companies have arrangements with their ISPs for expected usage and such. There can be a grace period as well, when you hit up the user and say &quot;hey, you&#x27;re using a lot of bw, is all well?&quot; You also combine this with abuse reports from the victims if a DDoS is in fact underway. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad for an ISP to establish trust with a customer, either, this already happens with things like DMCA requests.<p>&gt;Suppose DDOS happens from iot devices. One of this is an important medical device that got hacked. Do you auto shut it down and block it&#x27;s traffic. What about the life critical device under same IP through NAT that is secure also getting blocked?<p>Life critical devices aren&#x27;t exposed to the internet.

comment,14247630,,,1493741461,,devdevdev1,"It seems very much like the B+ tree approach is just a mental model put on top of the exact same idea that is being argued against. The initial list of &quot;bad things about LSM approaches&quot; has almost exactly the same items on it as the list of features the B+ approach claims to achieve.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m getting this all wrong, but aren&#x27;t the leaves also representing chunked data, which is compressed.<p>The Prometheus solution also sequentially places compressed chunks for the same series. The time slicing actually has a lot of benefits and can simply be seen as the first level of the described B+ tree. An index of chunks for a series can then be seen as the second level.<p>The potential read amplification here seems completely equivalent. Just from my high-level view, all properties of the read and write path seem almost identical."

This helped keep them fresh and allow them to broaden their range of experience without needing to permanently leave the institution.

The practical effect of having faster ram on frametimes is immense and sometimes a lot bigger than what you&#x27;d expect. Moving from just barely reaching 60 FPS in the Crysis train sequence to comfortable 80, with an i3, is very nice. There is also the Ryse sequence (~ at minute 7) where performance of the i3 doubles, just because of the faster ram."

In 1960, among never-married American adults aged 25-34, there were 139 men with jobs for every 100 women, with or without jobs. ...By 2012 there were only 91 employed men for every 100 women in this group. ...Even a small imbalance can have big effects. Imagine a simplified “mating market” consisting of ten men and ten women, all heterosexual. Everyone pairs up. Now take one man away. One woman is doomed to be single, so she may opt to poach another woman’s partner. A chain reaction ensues: all the women are suddenly less secure in their relationships. Some of the men, by contrast, become tempted to play the field rather than settle down. In most rich countries the supply of eligible blue-collar men does not match demand. Among black Americans, thanks to mass incarceration, it does not come close. For every 100 African-American women aged 25-54 who are not behind bars, there are only 83 men of the same age at liberty.&quot;<p>Even more reason for &quot;ban the box&quot;

comment,14247513,,,1493740855,,scottbez1,"I think there&#x27;s two distinct notions of type safety being discussed here: most deserializers in typed languages provide type safety once successfully deserialized, but the IDL&#x2F;shared-schema approach helps guarantee that you&#x27;ll be able to successfully deserialize the data into a type-safe representation in the first place.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to XML, but can say that even with &quot;type safe&quot; json serialization, I&#x27;ve seen several bugs due to some json libraries treating all numbers as doubles internally, meaning bad things happen when you&#x27;re actually serializing integers larger than 52 bits (say, a nano timestamp). Sure, maybe it&#x27;s a bug in the json library because the json spec doesn&#x27;t establish any max precision for numbers, but it&#x27;s not hard to run into it when different components&#x2F;languages with independently implemented json libraries try to talk to each other.<p>Shared schema approaches like proto also make it really hard to accidentally typo the name of the field, or accidentally try to read a field as a string rather than a list of strings.<p>Just like I wouldn&#x27;t consider code to be type safe if it passed data around as raw Objects and each usage cast it to the expected type, I wouldn&#x27;t consider services that communicate with each other using independently (manually) implemented parsers&#x2F;extractors as being type safe, even if the &quot;meat&quot; of the code is dealing with strongly typed data on either end."

In other words, is there something that you&#x27;ve worked on in the past that you were passionate about, and found yourself thinking about, even when not &quot;working&quot; ?<p>If the answer to any of the above is &quot;yes&quot;, then you may just need to find another job that better suits your interests and needs in terms of career progression.  Software development jobs can vary greatly in terms of being interesting&#x2F;challenging.

comment,14247402,,,1493740363,,tripzilch,"&gt; give the N.S.A. copies of internet messages <i>that cross the international border</i> and contain a search term that identifies foreigners<p>That&#x27;s a pretty misleading way to state the criteria. A reader that doesn&#x27;t know any better would assume that a message that is sent from within the USA to somewhere else within the USA, would already have been exempt from this program.<p>But everybody with a little bit of background knowledge, including the author, knows that internet packets are routed, cached and stored all over the planet without regard to international borders. Even a packet or message that has both endpoints on US soil is very likely to cross international borders at some point in its route, because that&#x27;s how the internet works and these services&#x27; infrastructure.<p>Just like calling this a &quot;major development&quot;. I mean really, is this defeat? Sunk the bar that low? Call it &quot;highly unlikely&quot;, &quot;unprecedented&quot; or something like that if you want to highlight the fact how <i>unusual</i> it is that the NSA gives up a tiny crumb of its capabilities. Call it &quot;promising&quot; maybe if you want to be really optimistic about it (hah).<p>But in what universe is this a &quot;major development&quot;, instead of a tiny insignifant drop in the ocean of the NSAs vast and total surveillance capabilities? Does <i>anybody</i> believe that they are now in any way subject to less surveillance than before? It&#x27;s like lowering the speed limit by 0.1mph and calling it a &quot;major development&quot; for the safety of kids playing on the streets.<p>Here&#x27;s another nice one:<p>&gt; The inquiries were conducted for legitimate intelligence purposes, the official said, but under rules imposed by the intelligence court, analysts were not supposed to search for Americans’ information within that data set<p>So ... the inquiries were conducted for legitimate purposes, it&#x27;s just that they were against the rules, is all. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m familiar with this new interpretation of the word &quot;legitimate&quot;.<p>No but seriously can anyone explain this line? If I&#x27;m being as favourable as I can possibly manage, I suppose they mean this: The <i>purpose</i> of the inquiries was legitimate, it&#x27;s just <i>performing</i> them is not. So what does it mean if merely the purpose is legitimate? Did this official just try to let off these NSA-analysts because &quot;the ends justified the means&quot; ??<p>Not that it matters that much to me any way, because I am one of those filthy foreigners that doesn&#x27;t have any right to any privacy whatsoever in the eyes of the NSA and a worryingly large percentage of US citizens cheering them on for that, because it is not them--ehm I mean because it is their job (if you don&#x27;t think too hard about it). There&#x27;s so many people arguing, many people who are otherwise very reasonable, that it&#x27;s somehow okay to utterly violate people&#x27;s privacy (on an unprecedented global scale) for <i>no other reason</i> than they are foreigners. No other reason. Being foreign is enough that you decided my private life is somehow not my own. And of course that my government is doing it too! Except that they don&#x27;t have the budget or the <i>unique</i> position in internet infrastructure to violate privacy on such a global scale. But they do still try. And I won&#x27;t let that slide or cheer them on for it either, just because they&#x27;re doing it to &quot;other&quot; people."

comment,14247354,,,1493740120,,shortsightedsid,"It&#x27;s also means that they are looking not for tech talent but for skilled labor. Highly skilled labor assumes no re-education for the current job but does not account for future work. If you are a master carpenter or a master mechanic then you probably have invested on tools, educating yourself on your own time. You are also probably specialized.<p>E.g. you are highly qualified at fixing&#x2F;tuning Ferraris but Toyotas are n&#x27;t your thing. So you go to a Ferrari tune up shop where you can spend the $500,000 salary. &#x2F;s<p>IMHO, Tech talent on the other hand works completely differently. They are more about talent (i.e designing stuff, critical thinking, analysis skills) rather than rolling into a specific shop to fix a specific issue.<p>That&#x27;s where there seems to be this problem with &quot;run a business, not a school&quot; that they have."

comment,14247345,,,1493740073,,hibikir,"I, on the other hand, have spent an inordinate amount of time, including waking up in the middle of the night for incident response, due to Hiberanate misuse, which is so easy that I&#x27;d not touch Hibernate with a ten foot pole.<p>There is one case where Hibernate can save you a significant amount of time vs plan SQL, and that&#x27;s arbitrary update statements. But the moment there are two joins in there, predicting hibernate performance is not necessarily easy, and differentiating a query that will run well from one that will kill your system at scale is far harder than in plan SQL. In practice, the only way to use Hibernate responsibly is to examine the likely queries that it will generate.<p>My least favorite example was a situation where manual SQL gave me a very fast query that took a couple of milliseconds to run on a large database, but Hibernate&#x27;s answer was not even just one query: It was an accidentally quadratic monstrosity, when the original programmer wanted was one row: Hibernate just wasn&#x27;t smart enough to figure out which row it wanted in the DB, so it grabbed half the database. After I saw the beautiful queries that Hibernate had created, I had to give the finger to the existing data layers and do my own thing, which I am told remains to this day.<p>The way Hibernate is built only makes sense if it can hide the database behind it. In reality, it doesn&#x27;t, so I not only have to make sure everyone knows SQL well, but they also have to learn hql and hibernate&#x27;s most common pitfalls. All to save a little bit of time on the rare cases where I might have very dynamic queries that somehow hibernate won&#x27;t screw up.<p>Java EE was a pretty unfortunate thing, but under duress, I&#x27;d much rather use EJB3 and straight SQL over the Spring + Hibernate stack that many of us had to deal with between 2000 and 2010."

But though unskilled men might do some of those jobs, they are unlikely to want them or to be picked for them.&quot;<p>In my mind, there&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;not wanting&quot; and &quot;wanting but not getting&quot;, but the article lumps those together.<p>All in all, a great article for raising some theories, and the facts offered point out some questions we might not have had, but precious little evidence of any particular answers, just evidence to shoot down a few theories (and those disproven theories aren&#x27;t covered).<p>Not to say I think the article&#x27;s suggestions are WRONG...I just don&#x27;t have any reasons from the article to think they are right."

comment,14247231,,,1493739399,,cookiecaper,"The serialization format is an implementation detail. That&#x27;s why there are similar schema&#x2F;definition formats that ARE natively represented in JSON, like JSON-Schema.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s easier to maintain a format defined in an IDL like Protobuf or Thrift than a JSON format. Everyone is always on about how JSON is a &quot;human-readable&quot; format, which is nice and probably 90% true. What we want is a human-<i>writable</i> format, which neither JSON nor YAML really are. It&#x27;s easier to define a structure in Thrift than in JSON.<p>I still gotta review this release of Cap&#x27;n Proto, but after struggling with some buggy language implementations from the upstream Thrift project and evaluating Protobuf 3.0 + grpc, I think that Protobuf 3.0 is going to be the way forward for now."

comment,14247177,,,1493739027,,dragonwriter,"&gt; What _are_ the &quot;correct&quot; use cases for NoSQL?<p>Depends on which noSQL. GraphDBs make sense when your application needs efficient graph queries. Eventually-consistent, distributed stores make sense when your application needs very high availability and can tolerate eventual consistency.<p>NoSQL can also be justified on non-technical grounds as a temporary workaround for poor administrative policy regarding SQL databases, it most likely once the DBA group realizes that you&#x27;ve built a critical non-SQL datastore, the policies will be extended to them as well if the basic problem hasn&#x27;t been corrected."

My problem is that the the database is only a very small part of the system and doesn&#x27;t integrate well. I simply don&#x27;t have time to immerse myself. I have done this several times before and after a while I just forget. Not the principles but the syntax. We just had a need for a huge transformation. Someone wrote it in C# procedurally and it was super slow. I told him to try pure SQL and it was super fast. Really impressive. But the code is just super cryptic to most programmers and hard to maintain. And as I said before source control sucks.

I did it that way so it wouldn&#x27;t eat your data. Because downloading a new song everyday can add up if you have a limited data plan.  So in theory you could be offline indefinitely and the alarm should just work.  And then when you come back online, you&#x27;ll be able to hear the song again."

I&#x27;ve found out that the compression algorithm performance numbers affect the overall performance in a big way. On modern SSD the entire workload is CPU bound.

Electron is the fastest way to achieve that with a small team or if going solo.<p>In many cases your only other feasible alternative would be to use Chromium Embedded Framework or system web views. Those two let you reuse your web app UI but are progressively more work than Electron. Those options don&#x27;t require packaging a node server though.<p>PS.

comment,14246997,,,1493737950,,skc,"I&#x27;ve always thought the main reason NoSQL solutions became popular is that developers could finally get at and manipulate the data the way they wanted to.<p>I&#x27;ve known some very, very prickly DBA&#x27;s in my time who referred to the databases they looked after as &quot;My database&quot;. So they would say things like &quot;Don&#x27;t put junk in my database&quot;<p>And would give you endless grief over how you wrote your queries or asked you a million questions about why you needed a new table and why your proposed design was shit.<p>As a result, many of us devs tended to view SQL Databases  as some sort of dark art. So in this regard, NoSQL is freeing at first glance.<p>But if I&#x27;m honest, once I got over my fear, the &quot;pros&quot; of NoSQL solutions in comparison to good ol&#x27; SQL seem to be relatively feeble.<p>I think it&#x27;s easier to get up and running with a NoSQL solution because there is far less friction when it comes to rapid prototyping of ideas, but things get complex pretty quickly.<p>I&#x27;d also say that for the vast majority of applications out there, the difference between the two will mostly be a wash."

Like all software engineering, proper security requires careful balancing of tradeoffs and prioritization of security mitigations.<p>Just like you design software with the end user in mind, you should design security systems with the attacker in mind. Just like you prioritize features for by your expected user personas, you should prioritize security measures by your expected attacker personas. And just like you always want to cover the &quot;basics&quot; of UX, you always want to cover the &quot;basics&quot; of security.<p>First you should take care of the &quot;low hanging fruit,&quot; meaning you should implement industry best practices at all levels of the stack. Hopefully this is sufficient to mostly mitigate any threats of getting caught in widely targeted attacks, like mass scans for Wordpress vulnerabilities.<p>Unfortunately, implementing security best practices is only the beginning of defending against motivated attackers focused specifically on you as a target.<p>Once you&#x27;ve taken care of the easy wins, you have to balance the tradeoffs of engineering effort and complexity required to make certain mitigations. In practice, this means that what your security system will look like largely depends on the question: What is your threat model?<p>If you are an IoT vendor, your threat model is becoming a node in a botnet. That means you need to defend against a focused attacker reverse engineering your product to find a vulnerability that can be used to root the device remotely. Unfortunately this is basically impossible to defend against, but you can make their job much more difficult with binary obfuscation, symbol stripping, aslr, etc. Your best hope at that point is the attacker gets frustrated and decides to target some other product.<p>If you&#x27;re a search engine (<i>cough cough</i>) your threat model may be people scraping your search results (as hypocritical as that is...) In that case your first priority might be catching bots and serving up captchas.<p>Point is, your &quot;security engineering&quot; largely depends on your domain and threat model, just like &quot;traditional&quot; software engineering depends on domain and user base.<p>(That said, IANASecurityProfessional ;) )"

comment,14246628,,,1493735494,,gregmac,"I&#x27;ve largely abandoned ORMs that generate SQL queries for me. A mapping layer that takes a SQL result and stuffs it into an object (DTO) is useful, but anything beyond that is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.<p>For complex SQL, it&#x27;s better to write it by hand. You get to tune it and ensure the indexing is correct (either the query usage, or create&#x2F;modify your indexes), and you get to see exactly what it&#x27;s doing.<p>For even simple conditional joins, there&#x27;s something nice about knowing exactly what&#x27;s going on, and knowing it&#x27;s not going to be doing something that results in a nested join loop (eg: the type of slow query you don&#x27;t notice until you&#x27;re using it in production and performance suddenly drops).<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of Dapper for this, so a lot of my data layer code looks like:<p><pre><code>    public IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt; LoadOrders(int customerId) 
    {
        using (var db = GetConnection())
        {
            return db.Query&lt;Order&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customerId = @customerId&quot;, new { customerId });
        }
    }
</code></pre>
The one exception I make to ORM-generated code is INSERT&#x2F;UPDATE queries. For most cases, the ORM doesn&#x27;t have much it can screw up, and since it&#x27;s essentially just mapping code (&quot;Name = @Name, Address1 = @Address1, etc&quot;) it&#x27;s more likely I&#x27;ll make a typo or copy&#x2F;paste error than anything else.<p>I&#x27;ve spent too many hours debugging crappy ORM queries, and I find it generally takes twice as long (with quadruple the frustration) to get the ORM to generate the complex SQL you want it to vs just writing the SQL."

I understand it&#x27;s history and its use - but it&#x27;s also really, really difficult to understand and figure out complex SQL queries.<p>Personally, I thought REQL was a really interesting take on query languages. As a developer, it allowed you write much cleaner code. You barely need an ORM. REQL kinda sucks for analysts at first, but in the long run, it makes writing complicated queries much, much easier."

comment,14246610,,,1493735321,,sddfd,"I think the windows store just did not fit the usage patterns: People were used to download stuff right off the net, or use platforms like Valve&#x27;s Steam.<p>On a chromebook-style laptop, expectations might be different.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like the walled-garden aspect of app-stores, but I like that there is someone who can effectively respond if malware is reported. Sometimes malware is even proactively removed.<p>For non-power-users this is definitely an advantage. I hope in a few years I can just tell my parent to only install software from the app store, and they will be fine. Additionally, they don&#x27;t have to do anything to stay up-to-date.<p>Even for power users there is a (theoretical) advantage, which is explicit dependency management. Once you know that all your software is distributed through one channel, libraries and versions can effectively be shared. This is what happens in the Free Software version of app stores: All major distros have them, and without them dependency management would be impossible.<p>So what is the potential gain here? In some version of the future, we might hope that apps don&#x27;t include hard-copy versions of the libraries they are using, but just tell the app-store which versions they like to use. Security updates can then be pushed by the app-store vendor vs the app vendor."
comment,14246607,,,1493735317,,aub3bhat,"Docker was probably a victim of its own success, with so many containers &amp; orchestration systems popping up (CoreOS, Kubernetes, etc.), it became harder for them to capture enterprise market that they had taken for granted. Worse the impression that I got was somehow Docker with its great usability was for amateurs and not for enterprise users (where most of the revenue is expected to come from).<p>Anyway I think Docker is a great revolutionary product living up to the vision that was initially presented.

I dislike the memory consumption it eats up. There is nothing acceptable about a simple chat app eating up 1GB of memory when the identical IRC client I had was using 100KB and has more features and the same client was built back a long time ago.<p>As for others talking about how there&#x27;s plenty of disk storage and memory, that&#x27;s lazy. We&#x27;re losing a generation of native coders to people who only know about Javascript and never taking the step to learn more about how bare metal works, effectively losing all the knowledge of optimizations, iterations and programming skills we&#x27;ve learnt in the past three decades.<p>I can assure you, you can stick with Electron apps only for your business but the moment I find a native version of the same apps, I&#x27;m done with your business too. Slack, VS Code&#x2F;Atom, etc, none of them are on my recommendations list and they will never be until they either go native or there&#x27;s a native competitor.

comment,14246475,,,1493734586,,tradesmanhelix,"Not really sure how to respond to your first paragraph, but I&#x27;ll take a stab at it. All I&#x27;m saying is I think there _was_ a viable way for Canonical to bring Ubuntu Touch to market, they didn&#x27;t follow that path, Ubuntu Touch failed as a result, and I wish that things had turned out differently. Had they followed the approach outlined in Crossing the Chasm, I think they had a decent shot at upsetting the status quo.<p>^^ I don&#x27;t see how the above makes me a Linux fanboy?<p>As far as the next &quot;thing&quot; or &quot;winner&quot; goes, I&#x27;m not sure what that will be. My only hope is that it&#x27;s not locked down and non-free by default like mobile operating systems have been. However, seeing the way AI and such are shaping up, I&#x27;m skeptical that we&#x27;re not headed for a very closed, proprietary future with few if any viable alternatives to the mainstream offerings of Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that a &quot;better product than iOS and Android&quot; exists today. Sadly, Ubuntu Touch will never be that better product, nor did Canonical ever really give it the opportunity to be.<p>So, what could &quot;win&quot; mobile? Given that the smartphone market has basically matured, the only two viable approaches are:<p>1. Develop a niche product that could eventually grow into a mainstream offering, or
2. Build the next &quot;big thing&quot;<p>Unfortunately, Canonical tried to make Ubuntu Touch a direct iOS&#x2F;Android competitor from the get-go and they barely made it to market before everything folded, so I&#x27;d argue they tried to take a 3rd approach and failed. Right now, I don&#x27;t see anyone who&#x27;s really taking either of the above approaches with much success, but I guess the good news is disruption _is_ coming. When and how, we&#x27;ll just have to see, but one thing is for sure: Ubuntu Touch is out of the running."

comment,14246418,,,1493734197,,agentultra,"I&#x27;ve been programming for most of my life. SQL has been a big part of my career. And I love it. It&#x27;s one of my top 5 languages.<p>It&#x27;s a nice, functional, declarative language in the vein of prolog and such. You just tell it the shape of the data you want, where to materialize it from, filter, aggregate, calculate the window of, etc... and the system figures out how to execute it as efficiently as it can. It beats out procedurally munging data by a long shot. It&#x27;s more concise for many operations than ML-like variants.<p>It&#x27;s a great tool to have. And understanding the underlying maths, relational algebra, is beautiful. I&#x27;ve found trying to implement your own rick-shod relational database is a good way to try to mechanically understand the theory. Then move on to implementing datalog... etc. The reason why SQL continues to stick around is that the fundamental theories are quite sharp! I&#x27;d appreciate a more concise syntax some days but overall I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m displeased. It&#x27;s great!"

The Facebook of 2017 is nothing like the Facebook of about 10 years ago.<p>And most people are going in the <i>opposite direction</i> of what you are observing.

Didn&#x27;t you see it?&quot; If you haven&#x27;t, good job, you actually selected excellent people to be friends with.<p>The &quot;friction&quot; is <i>actually the thing which makes the difference</i>. From your profile, I see you are a professor. Which kind of learning is better? The one where the student experiences a lot of friction, and learns the subject very well? Or the one where the student watches flashy videos and goes away feeling all gung-ho, only to realize nothing stuck?<p>Sure, you don&#x27;t want things to be harder just for the sake of being harder. And neither do you want to diss things which are lowering the friction of connecting. The problem is all the manipulation going on in the name of lowering friction.<p>If at some point you say &quot;Well, but Facebook also needs to make money&quot;, then you can already see the problem with the entire business model by your own admission. Because then you know there is no line which shouldn&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t be crossed - including selling out your already immature teenage audience.<p>Conversely, if the demand for such a connecting service is so huge, there would already be a paid alternative promising a lot of privacy in return for payment."

While it may be effective with low n, the complexity will still grow in roughly the same way as n increases - for this reason I would still call it brute force.<p>Isn&#x27;t this why sudoku is still considered NP hard?

It&#x27;s also an enormously more complicated task, one which hundreds (thousands?) of developers have spent time on over a decade (two?).<p>I think you might be thinking that the impediment to removing the GIL is user code. It is not. The impediment is that CPython - the standard Python runtime - was designed around using the GIL, and it&#x27;s extraordinarily hard to remove it and still meet the existing single-thread performance goals. There are also ancillary issues surrounding user code - particularly modules written in C, I believe - but the runtime itself is the biggest issue."

comment,14246184,,,1493732175,,pscarey,"I&#x27;m currently using Firebase at work (startup, mobile app, web dashboards), and I think it&#x27;s got some great features.<p>It&#x27;s not a replacement for SQL, but an entirely different product (and has no doubt come a long way since V1, especially with Firebase Functions out recently). You have to make tradeoffs, like data duplication, for the advantages. From the sound of it, the advantages probably aren&#x27;t relevant to you, but I&#x27;m confident they exist for us.<p>- We only have to store a comparatively small amount of user data for the lifetime value of each user, so the actual database cost is marginal (i.e. data duplication is not expensive to us, as long as reads are fast). (Development) time is (very) expensive.<p>- Rapid development and iteration. I can make additions and make fields redundant with ease in response to customer feedback, my own development choices, and changing product needs. There&#x27;s no API update needed, as reads are client side. I have data model classes which store the reference in the database, some constructors, and getters and setters (About the same as any other data model + API would have). The release goes live and data just starts being manipulated in a new way. Alterations can have simple defaults with || in JS and ?? in Swift (even if it&#x27;s just an empty string).<p>- Minimal backend. Our application doesn&#x27;t require much backend logic, and that which we do have is mostly event driven with Firebase Functions, upon certain database writes. Works out quite cheap too (for now -  most usages don&#x27;t trigger any functions).<p>- Caching, and offline first. We take the approach that it doesn&#x27;t matter if there&#x27;s a short delay in 95% of our data updating - either due to patchy mobile signal or the data taking time to sync down. Firebase has made on device caching and real time updates to that data a breeze. With GeoFire, we&#x27;ve got instant map search (keys are cached by Firebase and contain sufficient information to filter, etc).<p>- Declarative security rules are very powerful, and can even reference values in the database itself for security control - effectively. We store a permissions tree in the database for our more complex security logic.<p>As a bonus, additional features like Authentication, Analytics, Push Notifications, etc are all convenient to have bundled up.<p>As you can see, most of this isn&#x27;t about the database tech, but the development speed for us. The perceived costs and inefficiencies may exist in the database itself, but there are massive advantages for the application development as a whole."

comment,14246169,,,1493732033,,VLM,"There is also the eternal rotation of the corporate wheel of centralization and decentralization, so when the official corporate HQ Oracle team inevitably becomes too slow and expensive and difficult and incompetent to deal with as part of the usual business cycle, non technical people will route around then and use Excel spreadsheets as their database, or dump json xml files into a filesystem, or use mongo primarily to keep the corporate Oracle team away, like how garlic keeps vampires away.  And then when the decentralized solution falls over from poor design or lack of scalability or lack of reliability or lack of backups or lack of support personnel, adult supervision will return and there&#x27;s a push to massively re-centralize into professionally engineered schema and indexes.<p>Another aspect of &quot;too complex&quot; is sometimes the true data structure of the problem is correct and also too complex.  Some programmers bite off small chunks and chew on them, then push back that the entire data structure of the problem should become the small successfully chewed up chunk.  A model that encompasses all of the concept of &quot;number&quot; is very complicated, so a programmer starts off writing a small simple integer library and pushes back that the definition of number should become the simple integer... then reality impacts and as the system evolves and demands are made, the concept of &quot;number&quot; needs floats, rats, complex, base conversions, maybe worse, and the original very complicated design is the only successful way to implement the business requirement of &quot;number&quot;.  Whoops.  If you baked into the cake at the start how to handle rats with zero denominators life would be a lot easier and safer than bolting it on later or praying the app level code handles it, for example."

comment,14246094,,,1493731247,,aidos,"Curious, this doesn&#x27;t fit my mental model: <i>it&#x27;s nonsensical to have a foreign key that isn&#x27;t indexed</i><p>I guess you normally want indexes on parent - child tree relationships (book -&gt; chapter), but you don&#x27;t want them all the time. What about when you have an &#x27;article&#x27; with a &#x27;status and a &#x27;category&#x27; and you only ever find all articles by combination of category and status? In that case you&#x27;d be maintaining 3 indexes, category, status and status_category, but the only one you&#x27;d need would be status_category.<p>Indexes are a tool to to allow for optimising lookups while foreign keys are a tool to allow you to keep your data consistent."

comment,14246082,,,1493731146,,josteink,"I&#x27;ve tested your example and sure: That seems like a bug in the declaration of the Promise-class.<p>What I like about TypeScript and which I think is &quot;sound&quot; compared to Flow is the whole experience and how it is backed by good tooling.<p>With TypeScript I can open almost &quot;any&quot; editor and expect it to understand and respect the typings of all my TypeScript code. It will correctly autocomplete, and tell me when I&#x27;m using undefined members.<p>Basically with TypeScript every part of the stack seems to work for me, the developer, to ensure I make the right decisions and get the assistance I need, at all time. That makes it feel like a very safe and sound language to write code in.<p>With flow? Well fuck that. From what I can tell, you get almost nothing.<p>You can run your compiler and see if it validates, but I&#x27;ve seen almost no editor-support worth mentioning, meaning that while the type-inference in the compiler may occasionally be better (but for how long? TS has a ton of momentum), the overall experience feels much less sound and much more fragile. Much more unsafe.<p>The type-declarations definitely feel as important as the way they are declared: they&#x27;re mere comments. They&#x27;re not <i>real</i>."

comment,14246073,,,1493731097,,wiredfool,"It&#x27;s unreasonable to hold the original engineer responsible for changes after construction that should require review&#x2F;stamp&#x2F;signature from another engineer, such as increasing the depth of the pavement on the roadway. If the bridge didn&#x27;t meet the code at the time it was built, that&#x27;s one thing. But that&#x27;s not the case here.<p>Also, the private engineering firm likely had nothing to do with the maintenance of the bridge after construction -- That&#x27;s the job of the state DOT and whoever they contract out to.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of knowledge and experience in State DOTs, they&#x27;ll do some bridges in house, some they contract out for.

Assume that there really is a Superwally out there who has worked in programming for seven years for some company without accomplishing anything at all. And I imagine that there is. It would matter a lot if he is part of the sample. In fact, the only sample that would make sense would be all programmers in the world, and now, thanks to Superwally, we all look pretty good.<p>And of course, there is probably some Hyperwally as well who can smugly boast seven years of <i>negative</i> productivity.

comment,14245962,,,1493730041,,fnord123,"&gt;The second annoyance I have is the push for schemaless. Schemaless does not exist. There is always a schema, except in a schemaless data store, the schema has been moved to app code and then my earlier comment applies.<p>This is a great point. It&#x27;s like types for programming languages. They always exist; it&#x27;s just a matter of whether you have the compiler managing it or whether you need to keep it in your head when you&#x27;re hacking.<p>&gt; I think the lack of understanding of SQL and bad ORM experiences (Hibernate WTF) is what led people to think SQL&#x2F;RDMBs were the problem when in fact they were not.<p>Again, like types in programming languages, I think the ability to iterate quickly without having to predict how the data will be used in the future leads to &#x27;schemaless&#x27; approaches which can be kicked out the door more quickly (maybe) than ponderous schema laden tables."

While other apps are sandboxed away from having access, all it takes is one update to the app to sneak away your private key to any remote server. You have to trust the publisher of this app, including their entire chain of source code repository management and app build&#x2F;release process. It takes a single instance of a malicious person inserting code that steals all users&#x27; private keys (disgruntled employee at this company, or social engineering attack to gain access to commit to their GitHub, etc.).<p>Fair point, not really applicable in this case though.

The basic idea was to turn tables into Key-Value stores and put Memcached in front of them.  The higher the traffic, the less normalized the data became.<p>Around this time, NoSQL databases started popping up, and a lot of my colleagues moved on to them since it fit so well with the trend toward denormalizing everything.  Some loved them and dove in full-force.<p>Personally, I kept working with normalized data, used a caching layer to handle the denormalized versions of the data and learned more about scaling with Master &#x2F; Slave configurations, and honestly felt very much like I was being left behind.<p>In order to see what the fuss was about, I tried a small personal project with MongoDB (this is pre-redis, I think), and honestly enjoyed the simplicity of it.  And then my toy project got a sudden popularity bump from 20 users to 40k in a day and my project just died.

For example, the Timeline feature released in 2012 was built on MySQL&#x2F;InnoDB: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;note.php?note_id=10150468255628920"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;note.php?note_id=10150468255628920</a><p>And last year Facebook released MyRocks, which is a space&#x2F;write optimized replacement for InnoDB, and is being used for their &quot;user database tier&quot; <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.facebook.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;190251048047090&#x2F;myrocks-a-space-and-write-optimized-mysql-database&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.facebook.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;190251048047090&#x2F;myrocks-a-sp...</a><p>I guess the things I&#x27;ve read about FB using NoSQL [1] is for other parts of their infrastructure, particularly Messages. It sounds like they had considered using MySQL, even though Cassandra was built for the Inbox feature. They ended up building a new system for Messages [2].<p>Now that I&#x27;ve spent a little time in that rabbit hole, it looks like one answer to your question is Facebook&#x27;s Inbox Search, which used MySQL originally to store inbox data (7TB for over 100M users, which seems laughably small with respect to Facebook&#x27;s scale today):<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.datastax.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cassandra&#x2F;cassandrathenandnow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.datastax.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cassandra&#x2F;cassandrathen...</a><p>&gt; <i>Before launching the Inbox Search application we had to index 7TB of inbox data for over 100M users, then stored in our MySQL[1] infrastructure, and load it into the Cassandra system. The whole process involved running Map&#x2F;Reduce[7] jobs against the MySQL data files, indexing them and then storing the reverse-index in Cassandra. The M&#x2F;R process actually behaves as the client of Cassandra. We exposed some background channels for the M&#x2F;R process to aggregate the reverse index per user and send over the serialized data over to the Cassandra instance, to avoid the serialization&#x2F;deserialization overhead. This way the Cassandra instance is only bottlenecked by network bandwidth.</i><p>The acknowledgments section makes it more clear that the MySQL data was indeed migrated over to Cassandra:<p>&gt; <i>Cassandra system has benefited greatly from feedback from many individuals within Facebook. In addition we thank Karthik Ranganathan who indexed all the existing data in MySQL and moved it into Cassandra for our first production deployment.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7891316"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7891316</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;facebook-engineering&#x2F;the-underlying-technology-of-messages&#x2F;454991608919&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;facebook-engineering&#x2F;the-unde...</a>"

comment,14245740,,,1493727698,,AndrewOMartin,"As a guess, SQL and noSQL are different tools good for different things and before noSQL people were trying to hammer their document-store shaped peg into a relational-database shaped hole.<p>To speculate, noSQL key-value stores became very popular because they allow you to model imperfectly defined situations, and to update that model quicker than in traditional relational-database type situations.<p>Consider the difference between writing some classes in Java, or bunging everything into a dict in Python. The Java solution could be more formal and well documented, but a pain in the ass if the model changes significantly. The Python solution is a bit more janky and probably sluggish, but can adapt quicker.<p>I think there are more people in things like research, self-teaching, iterative game dev, and exploratory startups that value the adaptability than there are in things like old school business consultancy for whom the underlying model might be static and well described."

comment,14245713,,,1493727456,,zmonx,"One of the most important and characteristic aspects of constraint programming is alluded to in the following part of your quote (emphasis mine):<p>&quot;involves <i>some attempt to further reduce the feasible set</i> associated with the node by applying logical rules&quot;<p>These <i>propagation rules</i> are among the major attractions of CP, and distinguish the paradigm from uninformed search strategies that have to consider much larger portions of the search space in general. I think a description of CP should put at least equal emphasis on this pruning mechanism as on the actual search itself, because sufficiently strong propagation may render the search completely unnecessary. In fact, this is exactly what happens in the Sudoku example of the article!<p>In a sibling thread, sfrank has cited a very important reference as an example of such a propagation algorithm, which serves to illustrate this idea and is also widely used in practice in CP systems and their applications:<p><i>A filtering algorithm for constraints of difference in CSPs</i>, J-C. Régin, 1994<p>To see this algorithm in action, consider the following example: Take three variables X, Y and Z, all of them integers that are either 0 or 1, with the additional <i>constraint</i> that they must be <i>pairwise distinct</i>. In Prolog with CLP, and said algorithm available under the name all_distinct&#x2F;1, we can state this task as follows:<p><pre><code>    ?- X in 0..1, Y in 0..1, Z in 0..1,
       all_distinct([X,Y,Z]).
</code></pre>
In response to this query, the system says:<p><pre><code>    false.
</code></pre>
This means the system has deduced that there are <i>no solutions</i>. Note that this result is obtained <i>without applying any search</i>! For comparison, suppose we naively post pairwise disequalities instead:<p><pre><code>    ?- X in 0..1, Y in 0..1, Z in 0..1,
       X #\= Y, Y #\= Z, X #\= Z.
</code></pre>
In response, the system now answers:<p><pre><code>    X in 0..1,
    X#\=Z,
    X#\=Y,
    Z in 0..1,
    Y#\=Z,
    Y in 0..1.
</code></pre>
This means that there <i>could</i> potentially be solutions. The system does not know whether there are any, so it shows us remaining constraints that must hold for any solution. Now, an additional <i>search</i> makes clear that there are none:<p><pre><code>    ?- X in 0..1, Y in 0..1, Z in 0..1,
       X #\= Y, Y #\= Z, X #\= Z,
       label([X,Y,Z]).
</code></pre>
Here, I have simply added the goal label&#x2F;1, which is the explicit enumeration and thus the search I have mentioned in an earlier post. In response, we now again of course get:<p><pre><code>    false.
</code></pre>
As another example of propagation, please consider:<p><pre><code>    ?- X in 0..1, Y in 0..1, Z in 0..2,
       all_distinct([X,Y,Z]).
    Z = 2,
    X in 0..1,
    all_distinct([X, Y, 2]),
    Y in 0..1.
</code></pre>
Here, the system has deduced that Z is necessarily 2, again without any search. For the other variables, both values are still admissible, and to obtain concrete solutions, we must again label them explicitly. However, we do know that there <i>is</i> a solution in this case, due to the strength of all_distinct&#x2F;1, which internally uses a complex reasoning about the value graph of the CSP that is somewhat anticlimactically encapsulated in such a superficially trivial predicate, but propagates much more strongly than simply stating pairwise disequalities would.<p>This shows that you can arrive at a solution (or prove the lack of a solution) <i>either</i> via a search <i>or</i> by using a sufficiently strong propagation mechanism. Doing more of one requires less work of the other. Please note that, as I said before, you indeed <i>need</i> an explicit search <i>in general</i>, because the propagation algorithms alone are, while often quite effective, <i>not effective enough</i> in general to guarantee consistency when different constraints interact, even if they guarantee domain consistency individually. This is a practical trade-off between propagation strength and efficiency of the available constraints. You also need search to enumerate all solutions, if there are more than one. However, note that propagators are also triggered <i>during</i> the search, and so unifying even a single remaining variable with a concrete integer may again lead to a situation where no <i>additional</i> search is necessary. Thus, the initial size of the search space is not a satisfactory measure for the eventual complexity of the search, because it does not account for the additional propagation that is applied during the search itself.<p>Even in the case of Sudoku, and even if you use the most powerful individual all_distinct&#x2F;1 constraints, you need to <i>search</i>, in general, to truly generate the unique solution explicitly. But the Prolog code shown in the article <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> (hence, it will lead to floundering constraints in general), and the <i>concrete puzzle</i> shown in the article is, coincidentally or not, correctly solved just by such propagation algorithms, without any search. This situation is also not particularly rare: In many cases of practical importance, constraint propagation alone already tightens remaining domains so significantly that no or only very little additional search is necessary.<p>Thus, everything you said is true: Yes, you need search in general, also when using CP, to obtain concrete solutions. However, to repeat, it is quite different from what one would call &quot;brute force&quot; search because the sophisticated and often very effective propagation algorithms <i>prune</i> the search space, often substantially, and can moreover help to <i>guide</i> the search with various heuristics. In practice, you typically buy a Prolog system just to benefit from these propagation algorithms! Various notions of <i>consistency</i> exist, and you can find more such algorithms in the literature references that are for example included in SICStus Prolog and other Prolog systems with constraints.<p>Second, note that the description you quote does not even cover the particular case that arises in the article and also many other cases in practice: That is, there are no nodes at all, because everything is already settled by constraint propagation before any search even starts, making the whole solution explicitly available without search.<p>The Eight Queens problem you cite is quite different from Sudoku, because it may have <i>multiple</i> solutions. For this reason, as you correctly observe, search is needed to generate the different solutions in such cases. But this does not invalidate the Sudoku example, where we <i>know</i> that exactly one solution exists, and sufficiently strong pruning could <i>always</i> determine it, whether by internal propagation or other algorithms that simply eliminate all values that do not participate in the unique solution of the puzzle. Nor does it show that the cost for the search outweights that of constraint propagation in either case.<p>For these reasons, I recommend to put at least equal focus on constraint propagation as on the search when discussing CP."

comment,14245674,,,1493727068,,pavlov,"Regardless of whether the HTML+JS+CSS stack is good for desktop apps... The one thing that bums me about Electron is that it bundles an entire web runtime with each app, even though a suitable runtime <i>already exists</i> as part of the operating system.<p>Seriously, WebKit on Mac and Edge on Windows would be just fine for &gt;99% of Electron apps. Using the available web runtime would be a tremendous saving both in build size and memory usage.<p>Did you know that Chromium contains 25.3 million lines of code? [1] Each Electron app is bundling a separate copy of that enormous codebase in binary form. It&#x27;s a terrible waste of memory.<p>It&#x27;s true that supporting the native web runtimes would be more work for the Electron framework developers, and sometimes would also mean more work for app developers... But most web apps have absolutely no good reason to be tied to Chromium, so for app developers the diversity would actually be beneficial in the long term IMO.<p>If someone wants to start a project that&#x27;s like Electron but uses the native runtimes, I&#x27;d actually like to contribute some work.

I do understand your need for this feedback, but I do not think that home-brew should change this setting once the user has set it to &quot;do not report&quot;.  This is key to the adoption of homebrew in some environments - for example, on some corporate networks having automatic exfiltration of analytical data, anonymous or otherwise, is instant disqualification for installation - and I&#x27;ve already had that conversation with our sysadmins, who notice these things almost immediately.<p>If there is something I can do to help you debug this, let me know - otherwise I&#x27;ll just happily continue upgrading home-brew as time goes by, and if I see something, I&#x27;ll say something."

So Mike brought him over to stay at my house, instead. He had been attending some science fiction convention, was about to go to the Galopagos Islands, always insisted on doing back exercises with everyone, got very rude in an elevator when someone lit up a cigarette, and bragged he could smoke Mike&#x27;s brother Greg under the table. In case you&#x27;re ever at a party, and you have some pot that he wants to smoke and you just can&#x27;t get rid of him, try filling up a bowl with some tobacco and offering it to him. It&#x27;s a good idea to keep some &quot;emergency tobacco&quot; on your person at all times whenever attending raves in the bay area. My mom got fed up too, and ended up driving him all the way to the airport to get rid of him. On the way, he offered to sell us his extra can of peanuts, but my mom suggested that he might get hungry later, and that he had better hold onto them. What tact!&quot;"

comment,14245545,,,1493725262,,danso,"I&#x27;ve already posted on HN how I use SQL in my public affairs data journalism class [0]. To me, there is no better, in terms of accessibility and return on investment gateway language to the power of computation and programming than SQL, with the exception of spreadsheets and formulas. Even if you don&#x27;t go further into programming, SQL provides the best way for describing what we always need to do with data for journalistic purposes -- joining records, filtering, sorting, and aggregating. Ironically, I learned SQL late in my programming career, and initially thought its declarative paradigm to be mysterious and inferior to procedural languages. In fact, I don&#x27;t know how to do anything in SQL beyond declarative SELECT queries (and a handful of database create&#x2F;update admin queries). Turns out this is just powerful enough for me for most app dev work (Rails, Django), and the simplicity is a boon for non-programmers.<p>ProPublica just published a bunch of data-related jobs and positions.

comment,14245542,,,1493725226,,bogositosius,"I see what you&#x27;re getting at. IANAL, but generally, the only purpose of an arrest on a subpoena is simply to compel your appearance in court. The judge could theoretically slap you with a contempt charge for not coming in on your own but that isn&#x27;t likely. At least not the first time around. But still, I imagine it isn&#x27;t pleasant to have guys in suits show up to take you to court in handcuffs, so probably best to deal with it before it gets to that point.<p>By the way, it&#x27;s very easy to tell which subpoena actually requires compliance. It&#x27;ll be the only one with a judge&#x27;s name, signature, and (hopefully) a court seal on it. Anything lacking a judge&#x27;s signature could theoretically be used as toilet paper. Ask anyone working at a big corporation&#x27;s legal department. They will be quite familiar with these self-generated &quot;administrative subpoenas.&quot; I&#x27;m sure Apple and Facebook throw these out by the dozens every month from various prosecutors and law enforcement entities and tell them to come back with a judicially issued version."

This study proposes several routing methods based on road signs in a procedurally generated city which does not assume knowledge of global city structure and shows its overall efficiency in a variety of dense city environments. We show that techniques such as Intersection-Canalization allow for this method to be feasible for routing information arbitrarily on an architecture with limited resources.<p>This talk &quot;Robust-first computing: Demon Horde Sort&quot; [4] by Dave Ackley describes an inherently robust sorting machine, like &quot;sorting gas&quot;, implemented with the open source Movable Feast Machine simulator, available on github [5].<p>A Movable Feast Machine is similar in many ways to traditional cellular automata, except for a few important differences that are necessary for infinitely scalable, robust first computing.<p>First, the rules are applied to cells in random order, instead of all at once sequentially (which requires double buffering). Many rule application events may execute in parallel, as long as their &quot;light cones&quot; or cells visible to the executing rules do not overlap.<p>Second, the &quot;light cone&quot; of a rules, aka the &quot;neighborhood&quot; in cellular automata terms, is larger than typical cellular automata, so the rule can see other cells several steps away.<p>Third, the rules have write access to all of the cells in the light cone, not just the one in the center like cellular automata rules. So they can swap cells around to enable mobile machines, which is quite difficult in cellular automata rules like John von Neumann&#x27;s classic 29 state CA. [6] [7]<p>Forth, diffusion is built in. A rule may move the particle to another empty cell, or swap it with another particle in a different cell. And most rules automatically move the particle into a randomly chosen adjacent cell, by default. So the particles behave like gas moving with brownian motion, unless biased by &quot;smart&quot; rules like Maxwell&#x27;s Demon, like the &quot;sorting gas&quot; described in the Demon Hoard Sort video.<p>In this video &quot;Robust-first computing: Announcing ULAM at ECAL 2015&quot; [8], David Ackley explains why &quot;Robust First&quot; computing and computing architectures like Movable Feast Machines are so incredibly important for scaling up incredibly parallel hardware.<p>I think this is incredibly important stuff in the long term, because we&#x27;ve hit the wall with determinism, and the demos are so mind blowing and visually breathtaking, that I want to try programming some of my own Movable Feast Machine systems!<p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;movablefeastmachine.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;movablefeastmachine.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XkSXERxucPc"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XkSXERxucPc</a><p>[3] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.unm.edu&#x2F;~ackley&#x2F;papers&#x2F;paper_tsmall1_11_24.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.unm.edu&#x2F;~ackley&#x2F;papers&#x2F;paper_tsmall1_11_24.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=helScS3coAE"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=helScS3coAE</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DaveAckley&#x2F;MFM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DaveAckley&#x2F;MFM</a><p>[6] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton</a><p>[7] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Von_Neumann_universal_constructor"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Von_Neumann_universal_construc...</a><p>[8] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aR7o8GPgSLk"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aR7o8GPgSLk</a>"

comment,14245452,,,1493723723,,ouid,"The prosecutor&#x27;s office sends me a fake subpoena, I discover that it is fake and ignore it. They then send me a real subpoena, and not wanting to spend money on another lawyer, I simply assume that this one is fake too. In fact, without legal counsel, I have no real way of establishing which documents have official power and which don&#x27;t. Now imagine they arrest me for failing to respond to real one they sent the second time, I have been deceived by law enforcement into committing a crime, the very definition of entrapment."

comment,14245233,,,1493719611,,Matthias247,"Thanks for the explanation. If it works like you describe it seems to be a reasonable way to obtain streaming behavior. Will take a look at it if I find some time.<p>Regarding backpressure and HTTP&#x2F;2: You get some different kind of backpressure behavior with your approach (application level flow control) and the grpc approach (transport level flow control). Let&#x27;s say you have 2 functions which are called in parallel. For one the arguments are very big (let&#x27;s say 100kB), for the other one they are small (some bytes). With HTTP&#x2F;2 and transport level flow control the small function could get the bandwidth as the big one, which means more requests&#x2F;s for the small function. With pure application level flow control the small function needs to wait until the big one is fully sent before it can be put on the wire.<p>Which means if I have 2 tasks that execute concurrently and look like<p><pre><code>    A: while (true) { await callBigFunction(); }
    B: while (true) { await callSmallFunction(); }
</code></pre>
then with grpc I get more calls for B and without Cap&#x27;N&#x27;Proto I get the same for both (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge disadvantage in practice, because if you have large data chunks you should probably design your API different - and if you want realtime behavior then probably both protocols are not optimal. But it&#x27;s still something to keep in mind."

comment,14245089,,,1493717087,,Matthias247,"IMHO performance is only one reason for using a system like Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Proto&#x2F;grpc&#x2F;Thrift vs some handwritten json&#x2F;yaml&#x2F;xml&#x2F;binary protocol.<p>Others reasons are:<p>- Starting from an IDL you get a nice service contract. Which means both sides of the service (client &amp; server implementors) get a strong description on how the service should behave and what they need to implement. The more roles you have (architects, client-implementors, service-implementors, testers, mock-service implementors), the more you profit from a good specification.<p>- If you generate all the serialization&#x2F;deserialization code you avoid the tedious handwriting of this code and the possibility of introducing errors in this. E.g. some misspelling of field names or functions or copy&amp;paste errors can always occur and some of these errors are only detected late in the development process.<p>These advantages might not be visible if you have a small service and development team - you might even experience an overhead compared to just &quot;changing the client and server code&quot;, which are both under your control. But once you are working on a system with thousands of APIs you are quite happy if you don&#x27;t have to care about handwriting serialization and RPC code and instead can focus on business logic. I personally was responsible for deploying a similar solution for an in-vehicle infotainment system with hundreds of services and around 4000 functions, which worked out really well."

I know security through obscurity is generally not encouraged, but the fact is that the majority of exploits target iOS and Android, because the WP market share is so tiny that it&#x27;s just not worth trying. That counts for something.<p>I&#x27;ve got a Lumia 925 running Windows Phone 8.1, and a 640 running Windows 10 Mobile. Coming from iOS it&#x27;ll take some getting used to. I&#x27;ll try and be as unbiased as possible here:<p>PROS:<p>- fast, intuitive UI<p>- email, whatsapp, spotify all available<p>- no slowdown over time<p>CONS:<p>- lots of big apps missing<p>- No official Google apps (you can use gmail, but only 
through the stock email app. Youtube is basically just a shortcut to the site)<p>- Sometimes - no <i>often</i> - you get a 3rd rate app experience, as companies put less effort into the apps for the shrinking market. for instance, slack is a packaged web app on WP, but I&#x27;m pretty sure its a native app on both iOS and Android.<p>- limited hardware choice.<p>- no third party keyboards (but the stock one is, IMHO, one of the best mobile keyboards I&#x27;ve ever used)<p>- speech recognition is inferior to Android &#x2F; iOS<p>- tied to MS services (OneDrive, Bing etc)<p>I miss trying out the latest apps. When some new todo list app is announced on HN, it&#x27;s never available for me. I feel left out at times.<p>The flipside of this is that I don&#x27;t get sucked into playing Pokemon Go, or Minecraft, or browsing Pinterest. I switch to android for a few months after my last lumia broke, and I wasted so much time with my head buried in apps I would have never used on WP. I recognised this and switched back."

I am very curious about ways to prevent people from getting addicted to harmful things or things that they consciously decide to avoid.<p>I am not here to attack or defend Facebook either, but I think accusing them of being bad just because people get addicted to it is not a good measure. People get addicted to smartphones also but I rarely see people critical of the smartphone as a device."

comment,14245041,,,1493716534,,kentonv,"gRPC-style streaming can be implemented in terms of Cap&#x27;n Proto object references: When starting a streaming call, the client creates a callback object to be called by the server every time a new message is available, and then sends a reference to that object as part of the request. Or for client-&gt;server streaming, the server returns such an object reference.<p>The drawbacks of callbacks that you mention don&#x27;t apply in this scenario: The same network connection is utilized for the callback, solving the routing question. The callback object receives a notification when the caller is done with it (or disconnects), so it can clean up, solving the lifecycle question. Flow control &#x2F; backpressure can be achieved by pausing calls to the callback if too many previous calls have not returned (I actually plan to bake this pattern into the library in the future to make it dead simple).<p>So, it seems to me streaming in gRPC is actually a narrow subset of what Cap&#x27;n Proto can express.<p>For web stack compatibility purposes, it&#x27;s straightforward to implement Cap&#x27;n-Proto-over-WebSocket. I&#x27;m not sure that HTTP&#x2F;2 buys much on top of that."

Curent PSUs do not care about input (if it falls into roughly 70-280 volts no matter DC or AC and frequency). Output voltage is usually 3&#x2F;5&#x2F;12 or CPU-specific. All these voltages are routed to special connectors which cannot be inserted wrong way. (evev with a lot of force).<p>&gt; ...a PSU doesn&#x27;t supply enough wattage<p>This will cost you a single roundtrip to the store to replace with a beefier one.<p>&gt; - You can buy incompatible components that won&#x27;t work with each other.<p>Most stores have “configurators” (on their web sites) that show only compatible parts. If you are not sure, just google a reviev&#x2F;assembly example and order the same set.<p>&gt; - You could have static electricity, and you won&#x27;t notice until you turn the computer on and you hear a little spark sound... that means something died.<p>Never ever had a part died due to static. Before assembling touch the metal case of your new PC, that is usually enough to discharge.<p>&gt; - Getting a thermal problem by applying the thermal paste wrong or connecting a fan spinning to the other side.<p>Nowadays thermal interface is pre-applied for you. And the fan is already screwed to radiator.<p>&gt; - Crushing the processor by installing the heatsink with too much muscle.<p>You cannot crush a new intel or amd cpu, even with a hammer (if you are not assembling ultrabooks with bare dies of course).<p>&gt; - Connecting light cables to pins that are not for lights causing unintended behavior.<p>I do not know what are you talking about. Most of connectors can be inserted (physically) only the correct way and only into intended sockets. Those which can be misconnected are usually labeled&#x2F;colored accordingly.

comment,14244882,,,1493714325,,kentonv,"Your view isn&#x27;t contrarian at all -- in fact it&#x27;s widely-held by smart people. But I&#x27;ll present the counter-argument.<p>True, in many use cases, performance is not critical. However, when you&#x27;re doing big data processing or serving at scale, serialization performance does in fact start to matter a lot. If Google Search passed all backend messages as JSON rather than Protobuf, it would probably require 10x the hardware (we may be talking about <i>millions</i> of machines here) and wouldn&#x27;t be able to respond as quickly. Similarly, Cloudflare couldn&#x27;t handle its logging load without Cap&#x27;n Proto.<p>Many times, companies who started small and thought performance didn&#x27;t matter later found themselves needing to do massive, expensive rewrites in order to keep up with scale (e.g., famously, Twitter).<p>Hand-written binary serializers may be easy to write <i>initially</i>, but they are very hard to maintain. Over time, you&#x27;ll need to add and remove fields, while maintaining compatibility with old binaries already running in the wild, or compatibility across languages. It&#x27;s very easy to screw this up with a hand-written encoder, but very easy to get right with Protobuf or Cap&#x27;n Proto.<p>Finally, even if performance isn&#x27;t an issue, you may find that type safety is useful. If you are writing code in a type-safe language, correctly dealing with JSON actually tends to be a huge pain involving lots of branching. By defining a schema upfront and generating code, you can get a much nicer interface. And if you&#x27;re doing that anyway, then you might as well take advantage of the more-efficient encoding while you&#x27;re at it -- it&#x27;s easy to dump human-readable text for debugging when needed. (As of this release, Cap&#x27;n Proto ships with a library for converting to&#x2F;from JSON, and there are lots of third-party libraries to do the same with Protobuf. Both libraries also have one-liner &quot;dump a debug string&quot; functions.)"

comment,14244876,,,1493714299,,InclinedPlane,"I&#x27;m curious why you think shipping MP3 audio in software&#x2F;games was ever seriously at issue due to patents? Decoding MP3s has always been non-problematic, and encoding MP3s was only ever problematic for a few years about two decades ago.<p>Some modern games use uncompressed audio because it frees up a few CPU cycles and the min&#x2F;max balance on hard drives versus CPUs makes that choice desirable if you want to push the minimum spec. range on your game as low as possible (so that more people can play it). Though even then that&#x27;s only necessary if your main game engine is hitting the CPU pretty hard to start with."

comment,14244855,,,1493713932,,edem,When you start having polyglot microservices this all will make sense. For example protobuf gives you versioning and compiles to a dozen languages...just because it is not useful to you don&#x27;t dismiss the idea. And since I&#x27;m part of the minority I&#x27;m happy to have libs like this around. Just a sidenote: this behavior of neglecting performance alltogether leads to systems which take ages to build and collapse under pressure.

We found the company had a lot of problems that resulted from handwritten SQL, including lack of ability to adequately abstract the logic for proper unit&#x2F;integrated testing, and inconsistent data fields being returned by various queries, resulting in inconsistent api endpoint data returned to the client and thus inability to safely abstract without significant hacks&#x2F;nebulous data model state.<p>The worst thing we encountered with handrolled SQL over ORM was that it actually hindered our ability to deliver major business requirements.

comment,14244765,,,1493712589,,kentonv,"There are a few answers to that:<p>1. If you have a remote object reference, you can (explicitly) cast it to any interface type, and then attempt to call it. If it doesn&#x27;t implement that interface (or that method), an &quot;unimplemented&quot; exception will be thrown back. It&#x27;s relatively common to do feature detection this way.<p>2. It&#x27;s easy for the application to define a Cap&#x27;n Proto interface to support fancier negotiation. For example, you could have all your RPC interfaces extend a common base interface which has a method getSchema() which returns the full interface schema, or a list of interface IDs, or whatever it is you want.<p>3. We actually plan to bake in schema queries in a future version, such that all objects will support some sort of getSchema() call implicitly. This would especially be useful for clients in dynamic languages that could potentially connect to a server without having a schema at all, and load everything dynamically."

They just make the right decisions and hence are compensated accordingly.</i><p>A lot of being a successful CEO is being at the right place at the right time (of course: <i>in addition</i> to actual qualities).<p>Anecdote time:<p>I once was a franchisee of a major (services) franchise that some time ago decided to expand to Germany (I sold my franchise years ago). I&#x27;ll only talk about one person, but this happened throughout the network, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as successful as hoped in this country.<p>So anyway, I personally know one of the guys who lead one of the best franchises in a major German city. He expanded, became responsible for the entire wider area (which allowed him a cut from all franchises in it in exchange for recruiting new franchisees and for advising them).<p>He had this exact opinion (and he was a former business consultant too, I think he even has an MBA), when a franchisee didn&#x27;t do well that he just wasn&#x27;t good enough. He himself was proof, after all, just do your customer acquisitions and all the necessary stuff,and success will eventually come! It worked for him!<p>When a franchisee failed he acquired their shop, it was in the same city and they seemed to be in very good areas, lots of businesses that fit the description of the target market. Not a big risk one would think given that his own shop was doing exceedingly well with the exact same demographics, just a few miles away.<p>Long story short, he ended up giving up the franchise for the area as well as the two additional shops he had acquired. Today he has just that one original location. Turned out that the exact same extremely successful guy only managed to be successful in <i>one spot</i>. Not even in very promising areas just a few miles away did it work out!<p>There were more stories like this, some of them I knew personally (through franchisee training at the beginning where I met many of them), all people who were formerly employed and &quot;important people&quot; in their jobs, and who all thought that it&#x27;s all about <i>you</i> and the effort and skills you put in. Some of them managed to indeed build a successful business, but they all became much more humble over time, because they all found the large amount of randomness in their success when they tried to expand (area franchise or another shop).<p>So, tell me again about those successful CEOs, I&#x27;d like to learn more... the books are full of such people, successful in one place and time and failing in another place and&#x2F;or time. Because they themselves are only <i>one ingredient</i> into what is needed for success, and not even the major one (&quot;necessary but not [even nearly] sufficient&quot;)."

I would love to use Cap&#x27;n Proto but for me a robust JS implementation is a sine qua non.  Does anyone here happen to know if there&#x27;s been any progress in this regard or  have I missed something?

comment,14244699,,,1493711549,,spullara,Microservice architecture CPU usage can be dominated by serialization. It is one of the reasons that the JVM was so much faster than Ruby at Twitter for the frontend. The business logic just didn&#x27;t matter as much as deserializing thrift and serializing json or html.
comment,14244696,,,1493711504,,charles-salvia,"&gt;&gt; Our brains are fallible, and so only approximately equivalent to Turing machines; and even ignoring that can only compute every computable thing given both infinite error-free storage capacity (which they don&#x27;t have internally or externally) and sufficient time to execute the necessary steps of the computation.<p>So are actual computers.  They&#x27;re just &quot;less fallible&quot; and closer to a Universal Turing Machine than human brains in certain ways.  A Commodore 64 is also incapable, in practice, of computing certain computable functions, due to memory limitations and what have you, but nobody would really claim a Commodore 64 is not Turing complete."

comment,14244660,,,1493710999,,Pyxl101,"While this may be true for linear programming, is it true for integer linear programming or binary integer programming, which one would presumably use to model Soduku? The Wikipedia article you posted claims that integer programming problems are NP-hard.<p>&gt; If all of the unknown variables are required to be integers, then the problem is called an integer programming (IP) or integer linear programming (ILP) problem. In contrast to linear programming, which can be solved efficiently in the worst case, integer programming problems are in many practical situations (those with bounded variables) NP-hard. 0-1 integer programming or binary integer programming (BIP) is the special case of integer programming where variables are required to be 0 or 1 (rather than arbitrary integers). This problem is also classified as NP-hard, and in fact the decision version was one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems.<p>Here is an article on the topic of &quot;Binary and Mixed Integer Programming&quot; which explains part of the Balas Additive Algorithm (infeasibility pruning, I believe) in terms of backtracking:<p>&gt; At this point, both of the nodes just created are not eligible for further expansion, so we back up the tree, looking for a level at which one of the nodes is unexplored.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sce.carleton.ca&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;chinneck&#x2F;po&#x2F;Chapter13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sce.carleton.ca&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;chinneck&#x2F;po&#x2F;Chapter13.pdf</a><p>Another paper describes a method by Glover characterized as &quot;A backtracking procedure for implicit enumeration&quot;.<p>&gt; A particularization of the procedure based on Balas&#x27; algorithm. In S2 we presented and justified a flexible and economical back-tracking procedure for finding an optimal feasible solution of (P) by implicit enumeration.<p>See Figure 1 on page 182 (or page 6 in the PDF):<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anderson.ucla.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;art.geoffrion&#x2F;home&#x2F;docs&#x2F;e7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anderson.ucla.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;art.geoffrion&#x2F;home&#x2F;docs...</a><p>This branch of mathematics is not my forte however, so if I&#x27;ve misunderstood then I&#x27;d appreciate clarification. It seems like the algorithm is not backtracking in the sense of generating possible solutions and checking them, but is backtracking in the sense of fathoming which next cheapest (partial) solution might be feasible, and abandoning it if proven to be definitely infeasible, in favor of examining the (then) next cheapest potential solution.<p>Finally, see the following paper that compares and contrasts Constraint Programming with Integer Programming, and characterizes both of them as instances of Tree Search:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preserve.lehigh.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1780&amp;context=etd"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preserve.lehigh.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1780&amp;...</a>"

comment,14244582,,,1493709994,,thisisit,"This is as always a divisive topic. In most cases, people fail to see both side of the arguments.<p>Working conditions and pay in Infosys are not great for sure. There is a reason how this has come about - companies trying to do their best to cut IT costs. One of my friends working in a billion dollar IT product company says the company is fine with in-house teams for the product teams but everything auxiliary like Finance systems etc they want to sub-contract to Infy and the likes. They have much larger budget for contracting than they do for in-house hires. The reason is in the managements mind that is a high short term cost with immediate removals, whereas full time employees need to be maintained well. Now the company hasn&#x27;t done well in the past 2 years and there has been pressure on the company to trim more costs. How are they going to achieve it without compromising on their core products? Hire cheaper developers for everything they can think of. So there are market forces in play and if it wasn&#x27;t an &quot;Indian&quot; IT there will be a &quot;Philippines&quot; or &quot;Mexico&quot; IT company. There is pressure for cutting labor costs and it has to go somewhere. Sure people can unionize (or protectionism which is happening now) but that hasn&#x27;t boded well for other industries.<p>Then there is a question of whether US workers are ready to work on the reduced pay and work culture? It has nothing to do with talent rather the grind. My guess is people don&#x27;t want to work on the reduced pay and work timings.<p>It is a complex problem to solve but this is similar to people asking for US made iPhones. Sure the intellect required for R&amp;D might not be found in China but then the mass production with 24*7 cheap production lines is not something feasible in US. If the government goes after China you can be sure companies (maybe even Chinese one) finding the next &quot;best&quot; alternative - Mexico, Africa etc."

comment,14244540,,,1493709514,,kentonv,"Cap&#x27;n Proto RPC was originally released before gRPC. That said, gRPC is heavily based on Google&#x27;s internal RPC system which has been around for a very long time, albeit not publicly.<p>If you read the Cap&#x27;n Proto RPC docs, everywhere where it mentions &quot;traditional RPC&quot;, I specifically had Google&#x27;s internal RPC in mind (having previously been the maintainer of Protobufs at Google). So, you can more-or-less substitute gRPC in there for a direct comparison. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org&#x2F;rpc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org&#x2F;rpc.html</a><p>There are two key differences:<p>1. Cap&#x27;n Proto treats references to RPC endpoints as a first-class type. So, you can introduce a new endpoint dynamically, and you can send someone a message containing a reference to that endpoint. Only the recipient of the message will be able to access the new endpoint, and when that recipient drops their reference or disconnects, you&#x27;ll get notified so that you can clean it up. This is incredibly useful for modeling stateful interactions, where a client opens an object, performs a series of operations on it, then finally commits it. Put another way, this allows object-oriented programming over RPC. Also note that you can easily pass off object references from machine to machine -- currently this will set up transparent proxying, but in the future we plan to optimize it so that machines automatically form direct connections as needed, which will be really powerful for distributed computing scenarios.<p>2. Relatedly, Cap&#x27;n Proto supports &quot;promise pipelining&quot;, which allows you to use the result of one RPC as an input to the next without waiting for a round-trip to the client. This makes it possible to use object-oriented interaction patterns with deep call sequences without introducing excessive round-trip latency. This is described in detail at the RPC link above."

Surely for each piece, some values are <i>not</i> admissible, otherwise this would be a contradiction.

I realise marketing matters for these things, but when your product is an overseas music festival, you probably want to be emphasising people&#x27;s responsibilities for overseeing the assembly of the venue, flights and accommodation, permits, security, contractors&#x27; responsibilities etc ahead of the front end developer for the website.

comment,14244444,,,1493707680,,dragonwriter,"&gt; H1B visas were intended to address a shortage of highly skilled tech workers. They were not intended to supplant US workers, nor provide a readily accessible pool of low wage IT workers.<p>Yes, they were. In a market, a &quot;shortage&quot; is meaningless without reference to a price level, and the only way to address a shortage at any given price level is to add additional supply from sellers willing to sell below what the necessary price would otherwise be for the final quantity traded.<p>Adding more workers at the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; means increasing the quantity traded without increasing price, which inherently favors the buyers of the good (labor, here) over sellers.<p>Structurally, the &quot;abuse&quot; by Infosys, et al., and the suppression of wage growth for highly-skilled labor is exactly what H-1B is designed to support, not just a loophole in the design but the fundamental, basic, high-level structure of the program."

I also don&#x27;t mind the people I work with though sometimes I do find them annoying, but you can&#x27;t win at everything. Having my dream job, however, doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m making what I want to be making. To make up for it, I just do some freelance work for extra cash. I am also in the process of starting up a (side) business of a bunch of web apps with a saas model and hoping that will bring in some additional revenue.<p>The thought of losing my current job certainly haunts me, but the thought of having additional revenue continues to drive me and takes away my anxiety about the possibility of no longer having my current job. Fortunately, I&#x27;ve been at it for 5 years and my company got bought out. I saw several departments get sold off because the company that bought us was considered a monopoly and it was the only way. I also was given a choice about 4 years ago by this company: Move or get laid off. After some salary negotiation and asking if they could pay for my move across the country, I continued working for the company. So I&#x27;ve seen a few things happen.. and I&#x27;m still here.  We definitely have a great product and if they ever did sell it off (and lay me off), I would actually take it upon myself to redesign it the way I want it and try to become their competitor."

comment,14244321,,,1493705908,,mtgx,"I don&#x27;t know about the PC Pentium chip, but on laptop Celerons and Pentiums Intel must have like 100%-150% margin.<p>Those are not Core chips anymore (since post-Haswell). They are Atom chips, which Intel used to make for $30-$50, which the company is now selling for $100-$150.<p>Making such rip-off chips is one of the reasons why they merged the mobile business and the PC business, so they can show higher profitability &quot;overall&quot; for the division (especially since Intel used to <i>subsidize</i> the mobile chips, in order to compete).<p>Intel&#x27;s process advantage used to be more like 3 years. It&#x27;s now down to 1 year. This happened for two reasons: the other foundries reached FinFET, too (Intel was 2 years ahead just from FinFET alone before), and Moore&#x27;s Law slowed down <i>first</i> for Intel, allowing the rest to catch-up (and it&#x27;s now slowing down for them, too).<p>However, even with Intel&#x27;s one year advantage, AMD could use Intel&#x27;s chip building strategy to <i>best</i> it. What do I mean? I&#x27;m talking about how Intel will build server chips <i>first</i> on 10nm, and PC and laptop chips <i>later</i>.<p>If AMD starts building 7nm laptop APUs ASAP <i>before</i> Intel puts out its 10nm laptop chips, AMD could actually be seen as the &quot;better option&quot; overall in laptops (not just in value, in which they will be the winner anyway, but in pure performance).<p>Intel has also signaled in other ways (other than the 10nm strategy) that it will start fading out of the PC market to focus on &quot;more profitable&quot; server&#x2F;machine learning markets, because there&#x27;s not much for it to gain from the shrinking or at best stagnant PC market where it has 90% market share. However, AMD could grow from 10% or whatever it has now to at least 50% in the next 5-7 years, if it plays its cards right.<p>The only question is how interested they are in the PC market, too, because they may <i>also</i> chase the more profitable server&#x2F;machine learning markets first. I&#x27;m not going to say with confidence that this is a mistake. They may need to focus on that at least partially to become profitable (which they haven&#x27;t been for years), but I think it would be a better strategic move for AMD and for its image, if it started &quot;conquering&quot; the PC market first, before worrying about &quot;what&#x27;s the more profitable strategy.&quot;<p>If I were at AMD, I would probably worry more about Qualcomm in the PC market for the next few years (unless Windows on ARM is still a catastrophe, but I have a feeling it won&#x27;t be, and that regular users in emerging markets won&#x27;t notice a difference at that Celeron&#x2F;Pentium level of performance). And the reason for that is that I suspect that even with AMD&#x27;s sever cost-cutting over the past few years, Qualcomm&#x27;s ARM chips may still be more profitable to build at a higher margin, which may mean that Qualcomm&#x27;s chips could offer better value in budget laptops than either AMD or Intel. But that should be revealed to us in the next year or two at most."

comment,14244246,,,1493704644,,zmonx,"To see what I mean, please consider the Prolog program for solving Sudoku puzzles that is shown in this article, and try the following query:<p><pre><code>    | ?- sudoku(X, Y).
</code></pre>
This is called the <i>most general query</i>, since all arguments are fresh variables. Declaratively, we are asking Prolog: &quot;Are there any solutions whatsoever?&quot; In this case, the system answers with:<p><pre><code>    X = [_#3(1..4),_#24(1..4),...etc.]
    Y = [_#3(1..4),_#24(1..4),...etc.]
</code></pre>
This shows that the Prolog program <i>did not perform any search at all</i>: No concrete value is instantiated, and the system <i>does not ask for alternatives</i>. That&#x27;s right! No search whatsoever, and no backtracking at all, is performed in this program. No matter which definition of brute force search you are applying, this definitely does not fall into &quot;search&quot; at all!<p>In the article, a more concrete query is also shown, as well as its solution. This solution is found via <i>constraint propagation alone</i>. This means that the system has deduced the unique solution purely by reasoning about the available constraints, which it does automatically every time a constraint is posted. This is one example of an algorithm that does <i>not</i> guess.<p>This also shows that even supposing you <i>cannot</i> make an algorithm that &quot;never guesses&quot;, you can <i>definitely</i> make an algorithm that has to do <i>much</i> less guessing than searching over the whole tree. In Prolog, such algorithms are implemented and encapsulated in powerful combinatorial constraints like all_distinct&#x2F;1, which are available in many Prolog systems and which you can use in your applications. Internally, the associated constraint propagators prune the search tree by applying various algorithms for you behind the scene. The ability to use such constraints and their strong pruning are major attractions of using Prolog for combinatorial tasks.<p>You are right that there may be cases where such propagation, albeit quite strong, may not suffice to fully solve a concrete combinatorial task. For this reason, you have to apply a concrete <i>enumeration</i> of remaining variables. In Constraint Logic Programming over Integers, this search is called <i>labeling</i> and provided by predicates like fd_labeling&#x2F;2 or similar, depending on your Prolog system. The article does not use them though, and even if it did, the search could be guided by various heuristics by simply supplying a few options, which together with the pruning applied by constraints distinguish such a search from more uninformed search strategies.<p>Note also that the posted solution is quite hard to generalize elegantly. A shorter and equivalent Prolog program that describes 4x4 Sudoku puzzles is:<p><pre><code>    sudoku(Rows) :-
            Rows = [Row1,Row2,Row3,Row4],
            maplist(same_length(Rows), Rows),
            blocks(Row1, Row2), blocks(Row3, Row4),
            append(Rows, Vs),
            fd_domain(Vs, 1, 4),
            maplist(fd_all_different, Rows),
            transpose(Rows, Cols),
            maplist(fd_all_different, Cols).

    blocks([], []).
    blocks([A1,A2|As], [B1,B2|Bs]) :-
            fd_all_different([A1,A2,B1,B2]),
            blocks(As, Bs).
</code></pre>
This assumes the availability of append&#x2F;2 and transpose&#x2F;2, which are likely already provided by your Prolog system, and easy to implement if they aren&#x27;t."

A person&#x27;s range of motion is heavily dependent on the latter, especially when certain muscles are underutilized."

comment,14244159,,,1493703208,,rphlx,"While not exactly what you were suggesting, DDR4 ECC DIMMs and SO-DIMMS are already &quot;pin compatible&quot; with non-ECC modules. So it is straightforward to design a CPU and motherboard that support both, with a control bit in the IMC allowing the BIOS to enable&#x2F;disable ECC checking (and the extra ECC byte lanes) iff ECC modules are installed (and that&#x27;s what AMD did with Ryzen).<p>It is fair to say that Intel blocks ECC on its desktop i7 parts for non-technical&#x2F;business reasons (i.e. so they can sell a higher-profit E3 Xeon if you want DRAM data integrity beyond what non-ECC memory can provide)."

AMD could really differentiate themselves here (at least for those who care).<p>If AMD came out and said they&#x27;d open up the source for PSP or allow something like coreboot for those knowledgable enough to install it, every system I ever built from here on out would have Ryzen in it (I even have a system with an old Bulldozer pre PSP days).  As it stands I&#x27;m just looking at older chips and non x86 chips now.<p>I&#x27;m sure I am in the minority, but I also have some sway in what a lot of people buy in terms of technology, all I need is reason to be AMD&#x27;s fanboy, and I&#x27;ll give them every bit of business I can.  All I ask is they think of the little guys like me who&#x27;d rather have less attack surface in their machines.<p>I believe a computer should do what the owner asks, no more, no less.

comment,14244114,,,1493702186,,theossuary,"As somebody who consults with Corporate IT, more often then not I run into the mindset &quot;well if every other company is taking on the same risk then it&#x27;s a wash&quot;.  Aka disabling SELinux is what everybody does, we aren&#x27;t taking on any more risk than anybody else (and it&#x27;ll make us more competitive because we can iterate faster), so why not?  Very few companies think of security as a feature, because so few consumers think of security as a feature.<p>I agree completely, many many companies are totally fine with accepting that risk due to the trade-off for ease of manageability.  But I&#x27;m really not, in no small part because the overhead to managing a few computers is totally different than a large corporation with thousands of machines.  I just wish my vote counted to Intel (or AMD for that matter), and I could completely disable ME because I&#x27;d rather the more difficult management of machines over the much larger attack surface.<p>Of course it all seems to lead back to monopolies&#x2F;duopolies being bad for the average consumer.

I had to purchase new motherboard at a high price since the ones that support dual Xeons are either in an incompatible form factor or simply out-of-stock. I settled with Asus Z9PE-D8 WS with an SSI-EEB form factor.<p>- Outdated BIOS. I had to order a new, pre-flashed, BIOS chip since the BIOS that came with the motherboard refused to boot with the CPU and memory combo.<p>- Hard to find suitable ECC RAM. The motherboard only supports limited RAM (speed + latency) configs, and finding those is becoming harder. Availability looks seasonal at times.<p>- Needs capable power supply.

comment,14243898,,,1493698204,,developer2,"&gt;&gt; Every application on the phone is sandboxed<p>Note that you are trusting this app with your private key. While <i>other</i> apps are sandboxed away from having access, all it takes is one update to the app to sneak away your private key to any remote server. You have to trust the publisher of this app, including their entire chain of source code repository management and app build&#x2F;release process. It takes a single instance of a malicious person inserting code that steals all users&#x27; private keys (disgruntled employee at this company, or social engineering attack to gain access to commit to their GitHub, etc.).<p>It&#x27;s the same reason I am horrified that anyone trusts password managers from for-profit companies. Those companies have unfiltered potential access to your entire online identity, including critical logins like your bank and government services. The app is sandboxed, and the company promises that your (unencrypted) credentials never leave the local device. But it is impossible for them to offer an absolute guarantee that their app will never be the target of an attacker slipping in code that steals information.<p>In this particular case, you&#x27;re giving a single app access to potentially expose your key to theft. Less risky than storing your key in the default ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa, where any app running on your desktop machine has access to read it. Also likely to be less devastating of a loss compared to the compromise of the contents of a password manager."

Israel is a special case not because all regional dialects are mutually intelligible, but because it has no regional dialects at all (unless you&#x27;re talking about Arabic, but then it&#x27;s a far cry from an L-Simplex).<p>This is due to the history of Modern Hebrew in Israel being relatively recent. It only reached a stable grammar with a sizable generation of native speakers in the 1920s and 30s, and until the 60s at least non-native speakers probably outnumbered the native speakers. By then Television was unleashed, and killed whatever budding dialects that existed.<p>Practically speaking, there used to few minor dialectal variations in Jerusalem. It pretty much amounted to about 20-30 words, a default feminine form for the noun &#x27;cat&#x27; and a different pronunciation for the number 200. But even these features are barely left in Jerusalem, which had seen large population exchanges."

comment,14243796,,,1493696440,,i336_,"&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m curious how much of this depends on the driver behaving sanely at load and unload time, cleaning up after itself, gracefully handling unexpected initialization-time state, etc.<p>&gt; <i>Well, drivers are just processes. So as long as they don&#x27;t leave the hardware in a totally borked state a re-start of that process should re-initialize the driver and as long as that works I see no reason why the driver would not be able to restart and function.</i><p>Yeah. Fair point. I think I was conflating OS architecture with buggy drivers there.<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s sad the best option here is Erlang: that results in &quot;yay message-passing&quot; being restricted to large monolithic systems.<p>&gt; <i>And Erlang is soft real-time as opposed to QNX&#x27;s hard real-time. For non-interactive backend stuff it doesn&#x27;t matter that much but for front-end or hardware control it matters a lot.</i><p>Ooooh. Good point. Now I think about it, hard real-time <i>and</i> message-passing is... I can see why people like it :) those two things together are something I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out for a very long time.<p>&gt;&gt; is your code still in use out there, and if so, what sorts of things would I be doing (banking, using electricity, etc etc) if I were indirectly using it?<p>&gt; <i>I never released other than some very fancy routers where it was used under the hood without anybody being the wiser, but just about every industrial plant runs QNX somewhere, and quite possibly still the 16 bit version on ancient Compaqs.</i><p>Nice. Very nice :)<p>(I noticed from a comment elsewhere that it was a 32-bit reimplementation when QNX was 16-bit, and that you dropped it in without anybody realizing. That is both insane and awesome.)<p>&gt;&gt; I guess the next question would be, is an open reimplementation of QNX a sane idea?<p>&gt; <i>You&#x27;re asking the guy whose front page post reads &#x27;how to sort 2 tons of lego&#x27;? :)</i><p>Oooh! That was <i>you</i>! That was a really impressive design. I found the &quot;jet of compressed air&quot; so reminiscent of &quot;use a desk fan to blow the box off the conveyor&quot; in that apocryphal &quot;$2m consultant&quot; story :)<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m not always the best in making decisions when it comes to what makes economic sense.</i><p>Sometimes economic sense isn&#x27;t the best driver of things that become revolutionary ideas. Linux isn&#x27;t overall a bastion of best practices nowadays (sadly) but it was started as &quot;just another hobby project&quot; that happened to go viral (in the 90s, no less).<p>But even before that, UNIX itself was purely academic and its designers retained the &quot;information wants to be free&quot; mentality, continuing to quietly release updates via tape even after the licensing wars began.<p>But besides all of that, sitting around all day and figuring things out without commercial focus (at least initially) - basically just having fun being creative - can be the most educational. Oh, and fun. :D (I&#x27;ve only just recently figured this out...)<p>&gt; <i>But I think the world of computing would be a much better place if we went microkernel. Stability and reliability and real time in my book easily trump performance.</i><p>I don&#x27;t fully understand why Linus thinks that a monolithic kernel approach is honestly more efficient. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if it was a case of &quot;it was easier for me to do it that way, shhhhhh&quot;, or what. QNX is a microkernel that also offers hard real-time guarantees. I find it difficult to believe that microkernels do not offer practical performance in the face of such capability. But then again, I&#x27;m admittedly not an OS expert. (Although <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk%3ANanokernel"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk%3ANanokernel</a> - thanks Google for showing me the talk page instead of the article! haha - cleared things up nicely.)<p>I can very easily understand microkernels being more stable and reliable. (Does QNX have anything like Minix&#x27;s reincarnation server?)<p>Regarding realtime, I&#x27;ve personally been particularly interested in UI design for as long as I can remember, and one of the things I&#x27;ve been trying to crack for ages is how to get rock. solid. animation. - with consistent fps regardless of what else is going on - and I&#x27;ve finally concluded that there are no alternatives to doing this from the kernel up.<p>iOS got fluid animation on a 412MHz CPU, 137MHz LPDDR and 60MHz GPU (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blakespot.com&#x2F;ios_device_specifications_grid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blakespot.com&#x2F;ios_device_specifications_grid.html</a>) by doing screen updates with hard realtime, AFAIK. What more needs to be said? :P<p>Also - being able to do realtime hardware I&#x2F;O from hacked-together Perl sounds like... yes please!<p>&gt;&gt; how set-in-stone are QNX&#x27;s various APIs - ie, how much of a non-moving target are they, how well-documented is everything, how well-known are the bugs?<p>&gt; <i>QNX is incredibly simple at the core.</i><p>That&#x27;s promising!<p>&gt; <i>The hard part was to get the interrupt handlers work right, after that it was a walk in the park.

(Hopefully this was on an embedded box with no&#x2F;a skippable BIOS? :P)<p>Nowadays a decent i7 (a <i>decent</i> one) can get 200MHz emulated performance in Bochs, AFAIK.<p>And there are tons of other emulation and simulation options out there: on my way to relocating <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marss86.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marss86.org&#x2F;</a> I turned up <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cap-lab&#x2F;tqsim"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cap-lab&#x2F;tqsim</a> and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicorn-engine.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicorn-engine.org&#x2F;</a>.

But it&#x27;s not dead.<p>Obviously these tools are not perfect, but seem like they might make &quot;serious&quot;&#x2F;in-depth OS development a tiny bit more fun and accessible.

Hm.... could this ABI layer itself be a server to the microkernel? :D :D<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;...dude. No. Too much work. Don&#x27;t go there.&quot; in terms of the investment&#x2F;reward, with all the details taken into account,<p>&gt; <i>Fortunately when I started that trick I didn&#x27;t know just how hard it was. And eventually QNX did come out with a 32 bit version (2 years later or so).</i><p>Heh.<p>This is very very interesting, then. Depending on how long ago you did this (sounds like it was a while ago - not sure when QNX went 32-bit) you might remember quite a bit if you tried to do it again.<p>And if you did, you&#x27;ve already done the &quot;re-do QNX, fixing all the less-than-ideal bits that couldn&#x27;t be identified as such at design time&quot; thing - so you&#x27;d be going over it <i>a second time</i>, with potentially even more refined results.<p>&gt; <i>But an open source version of it would make big inroads into all kinds of embedded systems. But good luck getting the likes of NVIDIA to make a driver.</i><p>Eheheheh. The situation is not nearly that negative now! :D<p>First, you target Intel. This is simply tedious: there are real specifications floating around, along with a full GPLv2&#x27;d implementation in Linux that &quot;just&quot; needs normalizing (basically, distilling KMS and DRM out of the picture). As you go along, you may be able to get some assistance - Intel recently said hello to FreeBSD: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13848258"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13848258</a>, and I think you could describe QNX to be sort of on the same spectrum&#x2F;track as an OS ecosystem in some ways, so that might translate to not-entirely-closed-doors where&#x2F;when it would count. HD Graphics is a huge win to have available; many embedded systems (:D :D) don&#x27;t have discrete GPUs, and the on-chip GPU specifies two video heads (IIRC), can handle 1080p+, and generally from the standpoint of &quot;reimplement QNX&quot; provides an overkill level of hardware capacity&#x2F;capability. It would be more than enough to get in the door of making a serious MVP (that&#x27;s actually usable), if you will.<p>With some kind of established thing going on with Intel, work would begin to try and target AMD, specifically the APUs. This is likely where the NDAs would start, but it would be viable to do so because a) AMD would be able to see the Intel-only situation and want to compete and b) I expect there would be some sort of commercial thing with the OS happening at this point (eg, the MVP attracting some bites, either from VCs or industry) helping things along.<p>From there, it&#x27;d be a matter of going &quot;hey NVIDIA...?&quot; and either waiting 2E14 years^W ^W for a port or getting specs to help out.<p>I realize I&#x27;ve naïvely just described a very high-level timeline involving tens of man-decades of development, a noteworthily large team, and probably a 7 figure budget. Sounds like a ridiculous amount of fun :)<p>I&#x27;ll also admit that my experience with C is not quite where I&#x27;d like it to be, and I&#x27;ve never written about an OS before so I&#x27;d have no idea where to start.<p>But I&#x27;m game if you ever feel like doing this at some point. I was thinking of maybe making a website (hmm, what to call it - I have no idea) so people could have a hub&#x2F;point of reference to point to and figure out what to work on and stuff.<p>That being said, no rush; this sounds like a fun idea, best to keep it that way. So TL;DR get in touch if you ever want to pursue this :P<p>(To clarify - I&#x27;m not saying you have to email to reply to this comment, just that my email&#x27;s in my profile if you want to get in touch in future.)"

It was actually in IEEE Micro May 1982, &quot;A Unique Microprocessor Instruction Set&quot; Dennis A Fairclough.<p>The article looked at the statistical usage of instructions and placed them into 8 broad groups, Data Movement, Program Modifying, Arithmetic, Compare, Logical, Shift, Bit and I&#x2F;O &amp; Misc groups.<p>The result of the analysis was as follows:<p>For groups data movement and Program Modifying, 1 Instruction - MOVE [Cummulative usage 75%]<p>For group Arithmetic, 4 Instructions - ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV [Cumulative usage 87.5%]<p>For group Compare, 1 previous Instruction - SUB [Cumulative usage 93.75%]<p>For group Logical, 3 Instructions - AND, OR, XOR [Cumulative usage 96.88%]<p>For group Shift, 1 Instruction - SHIFT [Cumulative usage 98.44%]<p>For group Bit, 1 Instruction - MOVEB [Cumulative usage 99.22%]<p>For group I&#x2F;O &amp; Misc, depends on whether i&#x2F;o is memory mapped or otherwise, so either 0 or 1 Instruction.<p>Some possible extended instructions included INC, DEC, I&#x2F;DBRC and MOVEM.<p>The address fields (and in some cases additional flags) determine source and destination, etc.<p>So, in relation to the VLIW question, the instruction length is determined more by the addressing modes allowed than by the specific instruction itself (which is encoded in say 4 bits)."

(That&#x27;s quite aside from the possibility of intentional backdoors, which one would think would be reasonably secure so that only NSA and friends could use them.)  The answer is &quot;almost certainly not enough effort&quot;.

comment,14243658,,,1493694360,,saosebastiao,"While I don&#x27;t doubt that they&#x27;ll tell you that that was a scaling decision, it actually has more to do with an architectural decision that proved to be difficult to overcome once it&#x27;s flaw became apparent.<p>They operated warehouses using a monolithic oracle database, one for each FC. They had hundreds of different services using the same database. Whenever one service wanted to do something new, they had to spend a massive amount of time running their proposed database change past every team on the database. I&#x27;ve seen a single column addition take 9 months and hundreds of engineer hours to get approved.<p>So once the warehouses got really big, sharding was the obvious answer but they couldn&#x27;t make sharding work because they couldn&#x27;t coordinate their way out of their mess they created. They couldn&#x27;t scale because they engineered themselves into a corner that made it impossible to use normal best practices for scaling SQL databases.<p>NoSQL has an interesting lack of a feature that solves their problem. Because theyre not relational, they don&#x27;t really work very well sharing data across services and teams, so they don&#x27;t get into major coordination tangles on shared databases. Maybe that works for them, but it&#x27;s more of an indictment of their engineering culture than it is a slight on SQL databases. And it&#x27;s pretty punitive in a TSA kind of way: We fucked up once so none of you can have nice things anymore."

comment,14243616,,,1493693736,,versteegen,"Aside from being incredibly low on bugs (often, there are no known bugs at all, although complaints are likely to be treated as feature requests rather than bugs), PUC Lua is also far smaller, and vastly easy to hack on. There are various patches available for it. On the other hand, the guts of LuaJIT are difficult to say the least. Most opportunity to eek out a little more speed by making the code twice has dense has been taken. However I found that adding custom library routines to LuaJIT (for operations like concatenating tables) was actually pretty easy as long as you don&#x27;t want to be able to JIT them (since library routines call into an internal API which is well shielded, and there&#x27;s still a lot of PUC Lua code in LuaJIT).<p>Also, LuaJIT has other extensions aside from FFI; see the website."

comment,14243415,,,1493690130,,developer2,"&gt;&gt; cool things you possibly don&#x27;t know about<p>A hugely useful feature of postgres, that nearly no ORM&#x2F;ActiveRecord library makes use of, is the <i>RETURNING</i> clause of <i>INSERT</i> statements[1] (also supported on <i>UPDATE</i> and <i>DELETE</i> statements, though those are less useful).<p>A write statement with a <i>RETURNING</i> clause returns a resultset just like <i>SELECT</i>, with one row per row inserted, updated, or deleted. In this way, you can request the values of columns whose data was dynamically determined by the postgres server. This is especially useful for sequence (ie: <i>SERIAL</i>, autoincrement) values, as well as other columns with default values (such as an insert datetime, or a column with a value based on a complex expression).<p>This functionality is amazing, yet is so underused. Try to do a multi-row insert statement with MySQL with an auto-increment primary key, and know which IDs were assigned to your rows. You can&#x27;t, because there is no guarantee your auto-increment values will be sequential.<p>Example query, which will return the auto-increment sequence id and default insertion timestamp of the two inserted rows:<p><pre><code>    INSERT INTO members (name) VALUES (&#x27;Foo&#x27;), (&#x27;Bar&#x27;) RETURNING id, created_at;

Each cycle one thread, aka a triangle or quad, is issued to the execution units. Since they are four wide they can take a full quad a cycle which is a really good thing. Unfortunately most game developers seem stuck on triangles which tend to use only three of the SIMD vector lanes. This is bad but modern power gating means it won’t consume hideous amounts of power, it just doesn’t utilize the hardware to its maximum potential often.

comment,14243301,,,1493688526,,petermattis,"(Cockroach Labs co-founder here)<p>This is a really hard question to answer because there are so many different scenarios to test. Even if you restrict the question to KV operations a simple answer isn&#x27;t forthcoming. For example, if you want a distributed system with the fastest writes, then Cassandra is your best choice. Oh, but you better pay a lot of attention to all of the caveats regarding tombstones and node outages and overwriting data.<p>Overall, performance has improved a lot over the past year, but we still have a lot of work to do. Some of the high-contention scenarios that caused poor performance in the Jepsen tests have seen a huge improvement (10-100x), though admittedly we were starting from a poor position.<p>So far we&#x27;ve performed the most significant comparisons against Cassandra and MongoDB. In terms of performance Cassandra &gt; MongoDB &gt; CockroachDB, but note that most (all?) benchmarks test idealized situations. YCSB tests ideal write scenarios where data is never overwritten or deleted and data correctness is easily achieved because there are no node outages.<p>Unsurprisingly, PostgreSQL will outperform a single-node Cockroach cluster for simple operations. The internal target was to be within 2x of PostgreSQL performance for simple INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT statements. We were at that target earlier in the year, but a quick check reveals that we&#x27;ve slipped a bit.<p>Sorry I don&#x27;t have anything more concrete to offer at this time. I realize I&#x27;ve been saying &quot;we&#x27;re working on it&quot; for too long. Really, we are."

comment,14243292,,,1493688435,,seanmcdirmid,Hash functions on values don&#x27;t depend on identity and collisions are accepted as part of hash&#x27;s definition. A GUID (and MD 5 hashes) for all practical purposes are identities.<p>Identities really mess up equational reasoning which is why they are basically missing from pure functional languages like Haskell. A lot of clever solutions like FRP involve solving what are otherwise straightforward problems without resorting to the use of identity.

I just ran another Prime95 SmallFFT test and I came up with 133W package TDP on HwMonitor64.)<p>[1.1] Prime95 SmallFFT: 1800X @ 4 GHz = 253W, 6900K @ 4.2GHz = 255W<p>Basically AMD is low-balling their TDP here (they rated the TDP for like 1-2 core loads with maybe a mild load on the other cores, is the official word IIRC) and Intel is high-balling their TDP, something like mixed-allcore with a decent amount of AVX thrown in.<p>In practice: both 8-core processors at default clocks are around 125W at a full normal (non-AVX) workload.  Both 8-core processors are around 200W with an aggressive overclock.  The 6900K tends to win modestly in most cases in either scenario (CineBench is like AMD&#x27;s best-case).  The general take was that the 1800X was a <i>win on price</i> vs the 6900X, not an overall win on performance or efficiency.<p>To sum up, the processors are within 10% power consumption on any given workload which is pretty much neck and neck as far as I&#x27;m concerned (normal variability).  It&#x27;s a good result for AMD given their Bulldozer track record but it&#x27;s not an obvious win in efficiency.

comment,14243154,,,1493686371,,orblivion,"The standard needs a few things like:<p>* Easy, unambiguous way of determining whether you&#x27;re affected<p>* What risks are for each condition (have an AMT ready CPU, have AMT enabled, etc)<p>* Which patches fix which risks<p>And more. This will require some thought, and hopefully some UX people."
comment,14243151,,,1493686316,,elvinyung,I see -- so how <i>is</i> performance? I see that there are no published numbers for e.g. TPC-C or YCSB.<p>(For the record -- in case I seem to be especially pessimistic -- I&#x27;m actually extremely hopeful that CRDB will actually make scaling OLTP applications significantly easier for everyone.

comment,14243145,,,1493686247,,GavinMcG,"What do you mean by &quot;prove&quot;? Yes, you can define the earth as stationary, but if you&#x27;re taking that definition seriously – rather than just doing it to make the math easier within that frame of reference, or for rhetorical purposes – if you&#x27;re taking it seriously then you&#x27;ve got a whole host of implications that you have to explain. For example, why is Earth stationary, with the sun rotating around it, while all the <i>other</i> planets rotate around the sun? Given what else we know about gravity, how do you account for the sun with its huge mass orbiting the relatively tiny mass of Earth?<p>One response is that you throw <i>those</i> &quot;known&quot; things out as well, and so on down the rabbit hole.<p>We prefer theories to be coherent with the rest of our knowledge. Depending on the extent to which you&#x27;re willing to dispense with that – and to dispense with a huge number of claims we take as settled – sure, you can choose to hold on to basically any view. The question is why you&#x27;re holding on to that and throwing out the rest."

comment,14242950,,,1493683949,,wahern,"The same can be said of cryptography. Why believe that cryptography is more likely to be used for lawful and social beneficial purposes than for, e.g., terrorism, tax evasion, child abuse, etc.<p>In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the latter were in actuality the first adopters of cryptography, especially if you include other illegal uses such as copyright violation.<p>We could easily say that free market dynamics suggest that the cost+benefit will higher for criminals, especially unless and until cryptography becomes ubiquitous. So why not nip it in the bud? That&#x27;s been the argument coming from the law enforcement and intelligence communities all along.<p>Yet engineers are defensive and optimistic about the beneficial usages of cryptography. They&#x27;re dismissive of usages such as the encrypted iPhones used by the San Bernardino terrorists. And they focus on seemingly esoteric benefits--like improved security from extortionists--that most common people overlook or discount.<p>I tend to _agree_ with those engineers, am similarly defensive and optimistic regarding cryptography, and place a high value on benefits not obvious to others. I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to be consistent here. Any distinctions one can concoct to differentiate Facebook and their advertisers from, e.g., non-profits, can easily be turned around later.<p>The emphasis shouldn&#x27;t be on _presumed_ abuses, guilt by association, etc. It should be on hard data of actual usage and actual outcomes, with attention paid to implicit biases in collection and reporting. We also need to compare this against alternatives, taking into account (and quantifying) the futility of criminalization or regulation, etc."

I&#x27;m an Android engineer on the mobile growth team and we&#x27;re looking to grow our team with another Android engineer (the second role called out above). Right now there are 4 of us on Android (5 on iOS), working on a variety of projects related to sharing, referrals, push notifications, onboarding, login, signup, internationalization, and more! There&#x27;s two key things I love about the growth team - First, the ability to experiment on any idea I think might improve our product, and second, the ability to collaborate widely across the company on my projects. Even as a new grad new hire (~9 months on the job and right out of college), I was able to go from proposing an idea, formulating a hypothesis and test plan, to then rolling out the change because I was able to prove out the value with experimentation. And across the different things I&#x27;ve worked on I&#x27;ve gotten to work with our messaging team, trust team, trips team, and search team, to name a few. If you like driving your own projects, and collaborating with incredibly smart people, I want you on my team now!<p>If you&#x27;ve got any further specific questions about this position or Airbnb generally, feel free to email me (check my profile)!"

Americans have much higher debt, but it&#x27;s because too many of them have spending addictions, and think they deserve to live like royalty, and with the availability of easy credit get sucked into that trap.  I&#x27;ve seen it myself far too many times.  Also, perhaps education has something to do with it: Americans generally aren&#x27;t taught to budget or manage their personal finances in school much from what I&#x27;ve seen.  Maybe they are in Japan.<p>People in America complain a lot about things like the cost of rent, etc., which is definitely true IMO, but they do also tend to splurge on a lot of stuff they don&#x27;t need, such as Starbucks drinks.  If Americans were really short of funds, then how do all these Starbucks on every street corner stay in business selling $5-10 fancy drinks?"

comment,14242716,,,1493681351,,wcoenen,"Each input of the transaction requires a signature, which makes the transaction larger and therefore increases the required fee.

comment,14242671,,,1493680935,,aseipp,"&gt; If you have a full sandbox breakout exploit, both cases are broken. But if you have just a stupid JS issue that breaks same-origin, or causes a trivial arbitrary file read, jails will put you from them just fine.<p>If you can read an arbitrary file, what is stopping you from reading the browser&#x27;s e.g. password database files, inside the container, or any of the potentially sensitive cached files, for example? Those files are there -- the browser writes them, whether or not it is in a sandboxed directory or not.<p>Or do you assume that there is no password database that the user stores in any &#x27;sandboxed&#x27; browser instance, ever, and they copy&#x2F;paste or retype passwords every time or something? This is basically treating every single domain and browser instance as stateless. This is what I mean -- users are never going to behave this way, only people on places like Hacker News will. They aren&#x27;t going to use 14 different instances of a browser, each one perfectly isolated without shared search, or having to re-log-into each browser instance to have consistent search results or and autocomplete. It&#x27;s just an awful UX experience.<p>Of course, maybe you don&#x27;t map files in there, inside the container. That&#x27;s too dangerous, because if any part of the browser can just read a file, it&#x27;s game over. Perhaps you could have multiple processes communicate over RPC, each one in its own container, with crafted policies that would e.g. only allow processes for certain SOP domains to request certain passwords or sensitive information from a process that manages the database. Essentially, you add policy and authorization. There is only one process that can read exactly one file, the database file. The process for rendering and dealing with the logic of a particular domain <i>does not even have filesystem access, ever, to any on disk file</i>, it is forbidden. It must instead ask the broker process for access to the sensitive information for a particular domain. You could even do this so that each tab is transparently its own process, as well as enforcing process-level SOP separation...<p>The thing is... That&#x27;s basically exactly what Chrome does, <i>by design</i>. As of recent Chrome can actually separate and sandbox processes based on SOP. But it can <i>only</i> do that through its design. It cannot be tacked on.<p>Think about it. Firefox does not have true sandboxing or process isolation. Simply wrapping it in a container is not sufficient, and simply having 40,000 separate Firefox containers, each with its own little &quot;island&quot; of state, each for a single domain, is simply unusable from a user POV for any average human being. It is also incredibly dangerous (oops, I accidentally opened my bank website inside my gmail container, now they&#x27;re contaminated. Now if my bank website serves me bad JS, it can possibly get some content related to my gmail, if it can bypass browser policies. In Chrome&#x27;s new architecture, this can&#x27;t happen, from what I understand, even if you don&#x27;t run two separate, isolated instances of Chrome. SOP is now process level, and it is truly baked into the design.)<p>How do you make this not garbage from a user POV? By rearchitecting Firefox around multiple processes, where each domain is properly sandboxed and requires specific access and authorization to request certain data from another process. And where processes that need access <i>are literally denied filesystem access</i>. That requires taking control of the containers itself, the same way Chrome does. Chrome goes to extreme lengths for this.<p>The only way to truly enforce these things is at the application level. Just taking Firefox, slapping it inside Docker or a jail, and doing that 40,000 times for each domain isn&#x27;t even close to the same thing, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re suggesting."

comment,14242653,,,1493680710,,simonsarris,"Great article and applicable to way more than just infovis.<p>&gt; In denying the student the ability to frame their main task as exploration, they are forced to concede that what they want to find is not what their end-user may be looking for and then: (a) engage with their client or “create” a reasonable one with real tasks and decisions, (b) understand the data and tasks much more deeply, and (c) identify good validation strategies (no more insights!).<p>&gt; Maybe this is obvious, but when I started teaching I thought that being more open-ended about what I allowed was better. That somehow it would lead to more diverse, cool, weird, and novel projects. In some ways that’s true, but as I’ve argued elsewhere, teaching infovis is itself a wicked design problem.<p>Its not just infovis, I think this is a good teaching idea in a very broad sense. Reading other people&#x27;s writing nowadays, people are apt to be very lazy with their language and this by consequence makes them lazy with their ideas. Infovis should ban &quot;exploration.&quot; Architecture should ban &quot;modern.&quot; Career centers doing resume reviews should definitely ban &quot;utilize.&quot; I&#x27;m sure every field has such tropes that are maybe useful in the real world sometimes, but make for quite lazy school projects.<p>In fact I think he may be going a little overkill in justifying his ban on &quot;exploration&quot;. He doesn&#x27;t need to talk about weighing the pro&#x2F;con here, if before he had a paucity and now he has a multiplicity of interesting student results, he&#x27;s won and they&#x27;ve won. &quot;Surprise&quot; be damned. The kids can buy lotto tickets if they want to be surprised by big data.<p>For being so simple, restricting the common and obvious in classrooms is probably an underrated technique. This is widely done in photography classes, disallowing students from doing certain things, like making them only use film for a while, so they really have to frame photos and can&#x27;t just snap 1000 and &quot;discover&quot; one good one, or restrict to annoyingly wide prime lenses on an assignment to take some good portraits, etc. These constraints, even though they are constraints, greatly reduce the samey-ness of results and make the students engage their brains."

One would <i>expect</i> more left-leaning propaganda, because planting propaganda serves to fracture the movement from within, demonize it in the eyes of the extreme opponents, and undermine the legitimacy of the communication medium. Go read Dugin&#x27;s playbook, or the numerous English translations&#x2F;analysis.<p>Example: Why was Jill Stein photographed sitting at the same table as Flynn and Putin?

Unfortunately, there is no analogue to &quot;just join the military&quot; for the disabled."

So I think it&#x27;s fair to say that most C++ apps built by mere mortal companies probably still don&#x27;t use it. But I&#x27;d be keen to see data showing I&#x27;m wrong. Perhaps MSVC++ or LLVM leaves some trace of PGO behind in the binary, and a Windows&#x2F;Mac machine with lots of apps installed could be scanned to get an idea (for desktop usage at least)."

comment,14242320,,,1493677716,,Animats,"<i>The most confusing thing in Python is that there is more than one way to do it. :)</i><p>Exactly.  Python had a multiple thread and blocking I&#x2F;O model. That&#x27;s well understood.  Javascript had a single thread callback-based model. That&#x27;s well understood. When you have both concepts in the same system, things get much more complicated. It&#x27;s even worse when it&#x27;s a retrofit.<p>Consider Python&#x27;s Queue module.  If you call Queue.get(), your thread can block. But the async system doesn&#x27;t understand that kind of block. (Is that right?) So you&#x27;ve blocked all the async stuff running off that thread.<p>Go has lightweight threads too, called goroutines.  But because it wasn&#x27;t a retrofit, all lock mechanisms are compatible with lightweight threads.  When a goroutine blocks on a lock, its underlying thread is re-dispatched. Python 3.6 isn&#x27;t set up that way, because async operations were retrofitted in parallel with the existing machinery."

comment,14242224,,,1493676961,,wiredfool,"Yes. There are standards, they&#x27;re the Building Codes.  There are several versions of them that have come out over time, and they&#x27;ve been evolving with the advances in the science and engineering. When I was in Engineering school, we were generally taught off of a newer code than was in common use in the wild, but that transition was occurring in the couple of years that I was actually doing bridges.<p>In the case of bridges, you&#x27;re going to get the basic Steel or Concrete code, maybe some federal guidelines if it&#x27;s an interstate, definitely state DOT standards.<p>As for modern vs not -- There are definitely classes of bridges that I&#x27;d not consider modern. Anything with rivets, or sections that are built up by lots of little pieces (like the old style riveted trusses). Those aren&#x27;t done anymore for several reasons: onsite labor is more expensive than shop labor, rivets are inconsistent and weak compared to bolts or welds, and the ongoing painting to control corrosion is a nightmare. In places like the West Coast, the older bridges are not built to current seismic standards, which have been evolving as quickly as the rest of the codes (e.g. tiedowns, base isolation, column jacketing).  A lot of the older bridges also have details that aren&#x27;t terribly good for fatigue performance.<p>There was definitely an inflection point, probably in the 80&#x27;s where precast prestressed concrete started being the go-to design for more than just a plain old girder bridge over the interstate."

comment,14242179,,,1493676663,,naasking,"&gt; Even function has a definition in the philosophical sense unrelated to even the technical details of the lambda calculus.<p>Agreed, &quot;function&quot; has many concrete definitions, but arguably, there is some essence of what it means to be a function that we see reflected in each instance, and so virtually all of them are interconvertible in some real sense.<p>For &quot;object&quot;, I see this essence as procedural abstraction. Every discussion of objects features access to data mediated by arbitrary code, which is how they implement behaviour. Object factories and numerical abstractions (fixed, rings, arbitrary precision, etc.) simply don&#x27;t fit into your narrative of objects, so <i>defining</i> objects as requiring identity is immediately refuted in my mind.<p>Certainly you could argue that your approach to objects is <i>better</i> for software construction, but I don&#x27;t think that means other approaches are no longer object-oriented, in the way that we can say that C permits you to violate the essence of functions."

I suppose it would matter if you needed to set up a new laptop on battery power using crummy public wifi, but otherwise it isn&#x27;t a big factor for me in picking between the two.<p>Homebrew does have the cask system for installing apps and fonts. It is useful for grabbing things quickly, especially stuff like the oracle jdk and vagrant which use package installers. Still, anything you install with cask is going to self-update, most likely, rather than providing updated through homebrew, so it is really a one time benefit."

This is the reasoning behind stacking people with high on base percentages in front of sluggers.&quot;<p>This is the older, common wisdom that has essentially been refuted by modern analytics (SABRmetrics, if you will).<p>Team-dependent statistics like R + RBI (and pitcher ERA!) are dependent on the performance of the rest of the team.  They also correlate much less with a team winning games than other stats, like OBP.<p>That&#x27;s one of the central theses of Moneyball and the SABR movement: it&#x27;s better to ignore stats like (pitcher) Wins, RBI, and R, because they measure the teammates contribution more than the player you&#x27;re tryign to measure.<p>One popular advanced pitching statistic is literally named Fielding Independent Pitching, and is calculated using only BB, K, and HR.  This tracks more with contributions to a team winning than stats that include fielding skill, randomness, sequencing, etc.<p>What you described for a good hit &#x2F; bad field team does work around the edges, but these effects are not very strong.  The latest research suggests the biggest impact might be matching your pitching staff tendencies with fielders; if you have a flyball heavy staff, invest in better OF defense (Mariners, 2017).  If you have worm burners (Houston, esp w&#x2F; Keuchel), invest in your IF defense.<p>The goal of the modern stat movement is to evaluate a player independent of team context using statistics that do not depend on their teammates.  This is because estimating a players &quot;true talent level&quot; is much more useful than evaluating RBI."

The road signs would have a dialect very similar to our own <i>Gascon</i>, and there was no need to switch to Spanish.<p>One thing not mentioned in this article is how much these dialects have been losing ground over the past 50 years. My grand-mother spoke almost exclusively in her local dialect (<i>Bearnais</i>), my mom spoke it with my dad when they didn&#x27;t want me to understand, and I barely know a few words. There are schools and local initiatives to revive the old languages. The reality is that less and less people speak the dialects. Most people stick to Spanish, French, and are now expected to know English well."

comment,14242023,,,1493675328,,TheAceOfHearts,"I&#x27;ve been using Homebrew for a few years now, but I&#x27;ve gotta admit that recently I&#x27;ve been intrigued by MacPorts. Can anyone that has tried both extensively share their thoughts, and possibly explain why they&#x27;re using one or the other? I read up a few comments online from having googled around, but I&#x27;d love something more recent.<p>One of my complaints with Homebrew (and most system package managers) is that it treats all dependencies as equal. If I install X, which depends on Y and Z... I&#x27;d expect Y and Z to be removed when uninstalling X. If anyone else is frustrated by this, I&#x27;d suggest checking out homebrew-bundle [0]. The idea is simple: you create a Brewfile and you use that to track dependencies. Instead of installing stuff from the CLI, you add entries to your Brewfile and run &quot;brew bundle --global&quot;. Sadly it won&#x27;t do any automatic cleanups, so you have to run &quot;brew bundle cleanup --global&quot; to get a list of extraneous packages and remove em manually.<p>Another obvious benefit to using a text file is that you can annotate it with reminders. &quot;What did I install this foobar tool for?&quot;<p>I think migrating towards a shell environment which gets configured using idempotent scripts can help reduce bugs and lower the barrier of entry to people less familiar with the ecosystem, as well as make it easier to get your own system up and running. In the last few weeks I started toying around with nix [1], which seems to promise that... Although I&#x27;m still finding my way through their ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m a fairly pragmatic user, so I&#x27;m willing to accept some hacks here and there. A few days back I put up a repo [2] to show what my macOS + fish shell setup looks like. It won&#x27;t track configs to clean-up garbage or anything fancy like that, so if you make any change you might need to clean up manually. But it should make bootstrapping a new system a bit easier, and it encourages you to configure all universal variable definitions in a single place so you can add notes for why you&#x27;re doing whatever it is you&#x27;re doing. One of the biggest benefits of maintaining an idempotent fish config is that it has great performance. Since fish shell persists environment values in a single file and it lazy-loads function definitions, starting a new session happens almost instantly.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Homebrew&#x2F;homebrew-bundle"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Homebrew&#x2F;homebrew-bundle</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;nix&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;nix&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cesarandreu&#x2F;dotfiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cesarandreu&#x2F;dotfiles</a>"

This allows for more reliable and more complex concurrent applications with less effort.

comment,14241948,,,1493674790,,tnecniv,"&gt; This becomes less of an issue once you go through some abstract algebra. But typically, constants would come from the start of the English alphabet, and vectors, from the end.<p>That rule gets broke quite a bit though. For example, if you have a optimization program with some affine inequality constraint A * x &lt;= b, it&#x27;s not uncommon to refer to the individual hyperplane constraints as a_i^T x &lt;= b_i.<p>Math obviously has many more concepts than we have notation so selecting a unique notation for each concept is not feasible, but I bet some standardization can be done.<p>&gt; Did the code remain &quot;worst&quot; after you found out the names came from a paper?<p>No, I am fine with naming things after variables from papers, but I always put a note as to which paper the notation came from. Giving someone a few hundred lines of code where few variables have more than 2 letters and no context is just cruel though."

Some number of years ago there used to be a show called EcoChallenge. It was made by Marc Burnett but before Survivor. It was simply an adventure race but no politics and no contrived voting. Each team of 4 must be co-ed. There is a starting point, there is a stopping point and there are way stations along the way. Simply go from start to end hitting the way stations. Everything else was left up to the teams. The one big twist is that you can&#x27;t win unless <i>ALL</i> of the team hits each way point. Teams are allowed to race 24x7.<p>One of the last years it was on tv, a team of navy seals bombed out and a team of 3 playboy playmates went further then they did. The team that won (from NZ) had a sick teammate and spent two days nursing their teammate into passable health. They loaded up all that person&#x27;s gear split 1.3x, 1.3x, 1.3x, 0x and set off. They rocketed past all of the other teams and won by over a day.<p>This is what real success looks like.

I don&#x27;t clear my browser history literally every day and &#x27;wipe the slate clean&#x27;, I like having search history and trained autocomplete, and it&#x27;s kind of weird to expect people suddenly not to. It seems like it&#x27;s a move laterally, in a direction that only really satiates some very technically aware users. Even then, I&#x27;d say this approach is still fundamentally dangerous for competent users -- a simple mistake or a flaw in the application you can&#x27;t anticipate, or your own mistake, could expose you easily.<p>A more instructive example is an email client. If I use thunderbird and put it in a chroot jail, sync part of my mail spool, and then someone sends me an HTML email that exploits a Gecko rendering flaw and owns me &#x27;in the jail&#x27; -- then they now have access to my spool! And my credentials. They can just disguise access to the container and do a password reset, for example, and I&#x27;m screwed. Depending on the interaction method of the application, things like Stagefright were auto-triggered, for example, just solely by sending SMS. It&#x27;s a very dangerous game to play at that point, when applications are trying to be so in-our-face today (still waiting for a browser exploit that can be triggered even out-of-focus, through desktop notifications...)<p>The attack surface for a browser, and most stateful, trusted apps -- basically starts and ends at there, really. For all intents and purposes, an individual&#x27;s browser or email client is just as relatively valuable as any company&#x27;s SQL database. Think: if you put a PostgreSQL instance inside a jail, and someone exploits your SQL database... is your data safe? Or do they just exfiltrate your DB dump and walk away? Does a company wipe their database every week to keep hackers from taking it?<p>Meaningful mitigation has to come, I think, in the way Chrome does it: by doing extensive <i>application</i> level sandboxing. Making it part of the design, in a real, coherent way. That requires a lot of work. It&#x27;s why Firefox has taken years to do it -- and is pissing so many people off to get there by breaking the extension model, so they can meaningfully sandbox.<p>Aside from just attack surface concerns though, jails and things like containers still have some real technical limitations that stand in the way of users. Even things like drag-and-drop from desktop into container is a bit convoluted (maybe Wayland makes this easier? I don&#x27;t know how Qubes does it), and I use 1Password, so the kind of interaction between my key database means we&#x27;re back at square 1: where browser compromise &#x27;in the sandbox&#x27; still means you get owned in all the ways that matter.<p>Other meaningful mitigations exist beyond &#x27;total redesign&#x27; but they&#x27;re more technical in nature... Things like more robust anti-exploit mechanisms, for example, in our toolchains and processes. That&#x27;s also very hard work, but I think it&#x27;s also a lot more fruitful than &quot;containerize&#x2F;jail it all, and hope for the best&quot;."

VHDL is not practical.<p>Strong typing is useful when you use the same types for multiple instances, as in SW. However in HW, you construct your data to a set of bits, and then take as many as needed for the particular case. The type you need is a bit vector. Bit slicing checks can be done in the Linter tool, if needed. In DSP designs you can get benefits from VHDL types for signed and unsigned integers, but in my opinion even that does not cover the VHDL related deficiencies.<p>When you are working with synthesizable subset, you will never have problems with race conditions in simulation. You stick to a strict coding style, and it becomes the second nature. For beginners there are always issues, including this.<p>I find comparing the merits of SW languages to HW languages a bit silly. Describing SW does not benefit from the same features that describing HW does. For example Functional Programming (aka Haskell people) has nothing to do with HW. In FP you want to separate state from your functions. In HW the intention is to do the exact opposite. You want capture everything as local as possible, in order to enable maximum performance in speed, power, and area. This implies that OOP is pretty close to what HW requires, but not FP."

comment,14241441,,,1493671823,,Overtonwindow,"They could, and probably should, but then we run into the possibility of a zero sum game. First, that is pretty much all of the countries which produce our consumer goods, and might I add, buy our debt. Second, the CEOs of those companies are going to get really pissed if their products go up in price. So they&#x27;ll retaliate politically, but also pressure the other country to raise its tariffs on our exports.<p>Speaking policy only, an option to take is to make it cheaper overall for companies to manufacture here. Define a set of industries you want back in America, and reduce or eliminate their corporate income tax based on a certain number of employees and plants. Then even with the environmental and labor laws in place, they&#x27;ll still see it&#x27;s more economically feasible to return."

It doesn&#x27;t change anything about how the function is executed.<p>A coroutine gets executed differently from an ordinary function (or an ordinary generator, for that matter); when you call it using the await syntax, the Python interpreter can choose to run some other code while it is waiting for your function to return a result from I&#x2F;O (for example, a network request). A normal function call doesn&#x27;t allow that. (A generator might, if you use yield from and do a number of other things, but you have to do them by hand, whereas the await syntax does it all for you automatically inside the interpreter.)"

comment,14241342,,,1493671250,,mljoe,"Fraunhofer got paid lots of money from big companies buying patent licenses. Since they are a non-profit institution dedicated to scientific research, almost everything they make finds its way back into funding scientific research.<p>That said, we shouldn&#x27;t generalize Fraunhofer&#x27;s economics to the rest of the software industry. If it was just this kind of thing I would have zero problems with it. But we should be suspicious of software patents because the patent system implicitly rewards ideas that are broad (more things a patent touches, more $$$) and non-inventive (less work to come up with a patent, more $$$). Patents can be dangerous to human progress, and the patent system encourages patents that are. A broad patent could hold a whole industry hostage for 20 years, which is an eternity in technology. I sympathize more with folks who want to get rid of the whole thing for this reason."

Or wait, just let it happen and let the rich rot away in a city where no one else lives and they can&#x27;t buy anything, eat anything or where there are no cops, firefighters or schools because the staff cannot find any place to live (hint, in some areas of Germany this already is a problem, and I remember having seen some reports on HN that this is also valid for the US and London).<p>Cities are there for the entire population, not just rich foreign investor .... wanting to make a quick buck."

While the inclusion of such an ingredient is particularly desirable in black powders containing ammonium nitrate as a portion of the oxidizing material, I may include this stabilizer to advantage also in all types of black powders. Various compounds-may be used, with beneficial results, preferably from the class of solid aliphatic basic compounds, for example guanidine, dicyandiamide, urea, and the 5 like.

I have had to go back to a client and raise the amount I was charging telling them I had to be fair with my pricing and due to their needs was increasing it.. it was only about $300 or so.<p>Once I made the mistake of charging $500 to a client to do her website and she nitpicked everything to the point where it is now almost 4 years later and the website still has not gone live. I obviously made no money on it, but after reaching out several times, I can&#x27;t even get a hold of her.  I charged that little as a favor to my brother, who recommended her to me, and because she was looking for a  &quot;cheap&quot; website -- this was a red flag. She runs a million dollar business but did not want to invest in her website, but wanted to nitpick like she paid thousands of dollars for one.  So yeah.. it took me almost a year to get money from her... and when she paid.. she nitpicked even more and the website never even went live.<p>I always say to my clients: &quot;if you are fair with me I will be fair with you.&quot; This statement here seems to make people understand that I am human trying to make a living just as they are.

comment,14240961,,,1493668838,,ntsplnkv2,"&gt; It took just a few moments to find out if $30K is actually fair and progressive.<p>This is a false comparison. 30k is average DEBT they have-not the total cost of college education. Add many more tens of thousands-just so a company can take a little less risk, according to OP.<p>The reason we have subsidies is because businesses now want a degree, for no good reason, as evidenced by the OP. Because more people, who can&#x27;t afford it, need college degrees, the government stepped in to provide that, with loans, which they make money on, and grants, which they hope to be paid for by future taxes. That doesn&#x27;t account for all of the growth in tuition prices, rather, the demand does. Demand has skyrocketed because college grads make more. Since demand has skyrocketed, the supply of college grads has substantially increased-commoditizing the college degree, which benefits businesses because now they can pay less for a college grad. That&#x27;s the bottom line.<p>The problem is more nuanced than just cost and salary. The fact is to make good salary college wasn&#x27;t necessary decades ago. Now it is. So before what you got for free, now costs tens of thousands of dollars. How that is &quot;progressive&quot; is foreign to me."
comment,14240958,,,1493668825,,L_Rahman,"Thank you for writing a terrific criticism on how math is taught today.<p>In part because it&#x27;s one of the oldest taught subjects, I think the field has gotten away with how it teaches. In every other field we have an escalation ladder of abstraction that starts from tangible descriptions that a motivated learner could understand all the way up to symbolic jargon that is only accessible to insiders.<p>Math doesn&#x27;t have this at all. It goes from arithmetic straight into symbolic manipulation with only a sideways glance at describing three dimensional shapes. It&#x27;s lazy and the field needs to acknowledge that it has practical dimension as well as a theoretical one and each needs to be taught and described differently."

comment,14240943,,,1493668725,,jcrites,"Java packages are a fine &quot;module&quot; system if you&#x27;re designing a single large cohesive application that has no dependencies or trust boundaries. However, packages are inadequate by themselves to tackle the problems that arise when you assemble an application from many different components, each of which are independently produced and versioned, and have different trust boundaries.<p>Java has an <i>incredible</i> open source community and there are amazing high-quality packages available to solve any problem under the sun; and so it is common for Java apps to have large dependency graphs. For example, take Google Guava, a popular and powerful Java library. It&#x27;s so useful that other libraries depend on it. Let&#x27;s say that our application uses two libraries called Component-A and Component-B, which both depend on Guava. However, Guava is constantly changing, and so it may arise that Component-A depends on Guava version 17 while Component-B depends on Guava version 20.<p>This is called a version conflict, and Java packages aren&#x27;t enough to solve the problem well, though module systems can. For example, a module system allows you, as the application owner, to override the Guava version used by Component-A, replacing Guava-17 with Guava-20. If Component-A is compatible with Guava-20, then that resolves the problem. Another solution module systems provide is to allow both Guava-17 and Guava-20 to coexist in the same application, used separately by Component-A and Component-B. If those components are using Guava &#x27;privately&#x27;, as part of their implementation only, then this might also be an adequate resolution.<p>The default Java package system does not have a notion that there may be multiple implementations of a class like `com.google.common.base.Preconditions`, and that you may wish to select one version of it or another, or that you may want to use different versions in different parts of the application. It&#x27;s not normally desirable to tamper with dependency versions or load multiple versions simultaneously, but version conflicts happen and module systems give you tools to deal with them when they occur. Fortunately, the behavior of Java packages is determined by Java ClassLoaders, and module systems can implement their own ClassLoaders to provide dynamic behaviors like these that go beyond vanilla Java&#x27;s capabilities.<p>Since Java supports reflection, with regular Java packages, any class can access any other class and class member in the app, regardless of whether it&#x27;s package private. These reflection capabilities are super useful; they&#x27;re what enable frameworks like Spring, Guice, EasyMock, and Jackson. However, unrestricted reflective access is also a liability (viz. Ruby Monkey Patching), and it&#x27;s something that you&#x27;d prefer to outright disable or at least sandbox in most components you depend on. But since these components might legitimately require reflection in their implementation, like using Guice for dependency injection or EasyMock for testing, you may not be able to disable reflection entirely; instead, module systems can help you sandbox reflection so that it operates within the confines of the module, to make the system simpler and more predictable.<p>Some module systems like OSGi also extend into the runtime behavior of your application, and help you manage complex applications. Certain very complex Java applications act a bit like an operating system: there are multiple services within the app that communicate with each other, and the module system isolates them for encapsulation reasons, loads them in the appropriate order, connects them together through exported interfaces, and provides management actions like reloading a module while the rest of the app keeps running. These module systems are for Java apps what systemd is for Linux (including the fact that some people love them while others think they&#x27;re overly complex and should be avoided)."

comment,14240832,,,1493667992,,gerpsh,"&gt; Comparing MBAs&#x27; &amp; undergrads&#x27; experiences is specious, at best. And if you&#x27;re comparing other graduate students against MBAs, the recruiting process for MBB is exactly the same. (source: I did my time at McKinsey, the &#x27;M&#x27; in MBB.)<p>I&#x27;m talking about other graduate students, and (at least in this example) the recruiting process is NOT the same.  It didn&#x27;t matter if you were getting a master&#x27;s in basket weaving or a PhD in physics, you were required to take the test, again at least at this particular university.  MBAs were spared the test and went straight to the normal interview process. Also, had you not done an elite MBA, what do you think your path to McKinsey would have consisted of?<p>&gt; Regarding Prof. Rivera&#x27;s study, I&#x27;m curious whether it attempts to separate causation &amp; correlation. At HBS, the number of ex-MBB consultants in the program is roughly equal to the number who leave into MBB - many swap out and in, but the figures are in the same range. Does she account for that?<p>Prof. Rivera&#x27;s research consists of multiple related studies whose findings confirm that, regardless of skills and relevant experience, the most important factor in hiring for elite firms in business and law are educational pedigree, creating a discrepancy in opportunity for those that get an elite education and those that don&#x27;t.  She accomplishes this through ethnographic research on the recruitment practices of the firms.<p>&gt; Also, any analysis which groups JDs &amp; MBAs together is 100% flawed. Those two may have similar prestige, but wildly different career progressions.<p>I disagree in this context. The point of her research is that careers which tend to lead to powerful positions in society are practically closed off to those that don&#x27;t have elite educations. If you want get into high finance or MBB consulting or BigLaw, it behooves you to attend an elite university, and while you&#x27;re there, do as the Romans do. Prof. Rivera&#x27;s research is _really_ interesting, you should check it out."
comment,14240829,,,1493667990,,cookiecaper,"I&#x27;m coming in only knowing what those two links say (having no experience with the Moneyball media franchise or concept), but based on those, it sounds more like DePodesta is saying that the subjectivity was involved in selecting the relevant data points, and that once those data points were selected, they were used as the basis of evaluation -- they didn&#x27;t override their formula to benefit &quot;gut feelings&quot;.<p>From later in [2]:<p>&gt;<i>&quot;We turn to data as our flashlight in the cave – our guiding light,” DePodesta said. “We said ‘unless we can prove it, we’re not going to believe it.’&quot;...</i><p>Essentially, from these articles, it seems that scouting used to be a random occurrence based on the biases (or &quot;intuition&quot;) of the scout, and that DePodesta&#x27;s &quot;innovation&quot; was an attempt to link that process to something measurable. This &quot;innovation&quot; is so obvious in other fields that it&#x27;s not even mentioned, and that people who depend wholly on unjustifiable random chance deserve punishment and&#x2F;or ridicule.<p>Like most things, it boils down to subjectivity, because while you can find ways to quantify and analyze virtually anything, there is still a human who has to make a subjective judgment call as to what quantifications are significant to achieving their end goal. DePodesta says they would make those determinations and then refuse to change the criteria over undefined feeling-based intuition. That&#x27;s, uh, good, I guess?"

Assessments of the United States often assume that bridges may collapse when the 100-year flood (i.e., a flood with 1% annual frequency of exceedance) occurs, but this assumption has not been fully tested because of a lack of comprehensive collapse records. Thirty-five bridges for which a stream gauge on or near the bridge recorded the flow during total or partial collapse were identified and used to test this assumption. Flood frequency analyses, other statistical analyses, and structural reliability methods were used to quantify the return periods of collapse-inducing flows, identify trends linked to event and site characteristics, and evaluate the potential importance of collapse return period variability in assessing the impact of climate and land-use change on hydraulic collapse risk. The results indicate that the collapse-inducing flow return periods varied considerably (range: 1 to &gt;1,000  years) and were frequently lower than values considered in many climate impact assessments: 23 of the 35 bridges were estimated to have collapsed during flows with return periods of lower than 100 years. Annual failure probabilities computed using the full distribution of return periods of the collapse-inducing flows, as opposed to central values (e.g., means), were more sensitive to an assumed increase or decrease in the underlying frequency of flooding. These results suggest that linking bridge collapse to only the 100-year flow does not capture significant variability associated with collapse return periods, potentially reducing sensitivity to flood frequency changes and reducing the robustness of assessments of the impact of climate, land-use, and streamflow-regulation change on hydraulic bridge collapse risk.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ascelibrary.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1061&#x2F;%28ASCE%29IS.1943-555X.0000354"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ascelibrary.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1061&#x2F;%28ASCE%29IS.1943-555...</a>"

Nobody has built the vast network of bridges that we have before to the same standards, so operating experience should result in changes in our understanding of what and how we assess them!<p>If we look at the bridges that have survived 100, 150 or more years, they are mostly massively overbuilt due to limitations of the era they were built in. Perhaps some of the more modern spans are less overbuilt and are thus more vulnerable to environmental or other changes?"

comment,14240772,,,1493667665,,heipei,"I haven&#x27;t looked at Headless closely enough yet, but the biggest pros I can see are:<p>- Potentially less overhead (system resources)
- Much simpler setup (compared to something like Xvfb)
- Better support for actual automation tasks, e.g. screenshots, separate sessions, etc.<p>The last point is especially relevant if you run a tool that is visiting many sites in parallel. If you run multiple tabs per process to keep memory usage and Xvfb instances limited then you won&#x27;t be able to have separate browsing sessions, e.g. two concurrent navigations to the same origin could interfere with each other (cookies, local storage, etc). Another obstacle I have discovered is that you can only take screenshots for the tab that is currently active. For my site (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urlscan.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urlscan.io</a>) I work around that by manually activating the tab when the load event fires to take the screenshot.

comment,14240745,,,1493667457,,kobeya,"This is pure FUD.<p>&gt; SegWit contains copyrighted code from the privately funded company BlockStream<p>If by &quot;copyrighted code&quot; you mean the standard copyright and MIT license at the start of every piece of code in Bitcoin Core, sure. That&#x27;s how open source software works -- you copyright it and use that copyright to place it in a permissive license. Segwit doesn&#x27;t make any modifications to the copyright status of Bitcoin Core in any way. It is exactly the same!<p>&gt; Despite CTO Grerg Maxwell making a &quot;Pledge&quot; to only use the patents &quot;defensively&quot; there is nothing stopping the company from trying to monetize their patents on a portion of the Bitcoin code once the Code is implemented.<p>There is in fact a lot stopping that from happening, such as the innovator&#x27;s patent agreement.<p>But this is a distraction anyway because this thread is about segwit, and Blockstream has no patents, provisional patents, or anything else on that technology. And the time period for filing such patents has expired. It&#x27;s hard to monopolize and monetize a patent that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; They would begin to sue large US based exchanges for infringement<p>Infringement of what? Again, there are no patents!<p>&gt; Companies would slow Bitcoin support and the Crypto community would be further segment, delaying adoption overall but making massive amounts of money for BlockStream<p>...How? How does Blockstream, a bitcoin services company, benefit from a dying bitcoin?<p>&gt; Option 2 is that with their code in Bitcoin, they will be able to sell their services for a much higher price and it will give them a huge amount of leverage in the future<p>It&#x27;s FOSS. They have no special privileges over anyone else.<p>&gt; The &quot;Soft&quot; forking and the &quot;User Activated&quot; forking mechanisms devised by BlockStream to get their code into Bitcoin is devious to say the least. They both set the stage for further manipulative changes to the code base, this part of the work is mostly done by one user, BS hired hand, Luke Jr.<p>Soft forks are how every single change to bitcoin consensus logic has been deployed since the very early days (2011+) and predates Blockstream by a laaaarge margin. The founding of Blockstream is closer to today than the first use of soft forks by the bitcoin development team.<p>User activated soft forks have nothing to do with Blockstream. Blockstream&#x27;s CTO has even come out against the UASF on the mailing list. It&#x27;s a complete red herring to bring it up here. Luke-Jr hasn&#x27;t done any work on the UASF, just provided some technical peer review, as he has for many proposals, including ones he disagrees with.<p>&gt; BlockStream is supporting development of a &quot;2nd layer&quot; network (patented)<p>Again please provide some facts to backup your assertions. I can only assume you are talking about Lightning, which Blockstream has no patents on, and for which the window for filing patents has pretty much closed. Do your research: go type &quot;Blockstream&quot; into your favorite patent search engine. The only hits you find will have to do with sidechains and confidential transactions, neither of which have anything to do with segwit or lightning.<p>Please come back to reality. Base you opinions on fact and stop spouting conspiracy nonsense. HN is better than this."

Jihan&#x27;s company manufacturers the most successful ASICs for bitcoin and litecoin.  They&#x27;ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin mining operations.<p>Roger Ver also has recently launched a cloud mining service on Bitcoin.com which many view as a scam.  This is weeks after speaking on camera while deleting an old tweet criticizing Bitclub, a similar MLM cloud hashing service.  This speaks to Roger&#x27;s judgement especially after his Mt.

comment,14240649,,,1493666773,,marme,Gretzky is great example because he was not the best player because he scored the most. He was the best because just him being on the ice lead to others scoring as well. Just being out there he was able to help the rest of the team score as well. Contrast this with a player like Kobe Bryant who was a great individual player but horrible team player. Kobe did not get along with his team mates and other than the points he put up on the board Kobe did not really contribute much to the Lakers. Kobe was such a ball hog that they refer to a missed shot that is rebounded and scored by the offense as a kobe assist because it was only way he was going to give up the ball

The point is every program has bugs and if you have a closed source program that wrongly decides the fate of say 0.01% of people we need to be able to know these things. While judges and doctors and so on are supposed to rely on their judgement in addition to these programs there is potential for over reliance. I would not mind the closed source aspect so long as they pay 3rd party testers and auditors and release information about error rate but I have no idea if they actually do this.

comment,14240574,,,1493666220,,richard_shelton,"I prefer not to call it &quot;logic programming&quot; from the point of learning the language. Too many textbooks start from explaining that &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; or talk about Robinson&#x27;s resolution. And, as a result, student doesn&#x27;t know what to do with this language.<p>Declarative is a vague term, but for me it means mostly a way to compactly describe your problem in domain-specific terms. There are some languages in which you can  produce compact code, like APL or J. But declarative for me means readable too. And there are cases, when in Prolog one can write a more compact and readable code than in Haskell. In Prolog you can describe just the essence of the problem. Not always, of course.<p>Another interesting thing about Prolog that it&#x27;s a small language. It means that it has only few internal parts that make it alive (The complexity of many Prolog implementations is a result of fighting for perfomance). I really like small languages (like Oberon or Forth, for example), because it&#x27;s possible to learn how they work internally. And the knowledge of this inner working helps to understand the language better. There is nothing &quot;logical&quot; inside Prolog, just a few powerful imperative constructs.<p>The author of &quot;Prolog Under the Hood An Honest Look&quot; says:<p>&quot;Prolog, billed as &quot;logic programming&quot;, is not really. You may be disappointed if that&#x27;s what you expected to find. On the other hand, having backtracking, unification, and recursion inside one computer language leads to something very powerful and special.&quot;<p>And I, personally, like Prolog terms very much!"

If that information were easily available to whoever was going to enforce this (and maybe it already is quickly accessible, I don&#x27;t know), they would merely need to type in the tag number and see who it is registered to.  That person&#x27;s state ID or driver&#x27;s license has a photo attached to it and they could easily see if that person is either the driver or a passenger.  If the car is parked in a handicap spot and that person isn&#x27;t present, they can cite for a violation.<p>So there would not need to be any harassment of people who don&#x27;t seem disabled.

We would just be checking that when it is utilized, the person associated with it is actually present.<p>&quot;After that the state only has to authenticate the doctor&#x27;s note and issue the placard.&quot; - maybe it is that simple.  Let&#x27;s assume it is.  But when I renew my driver&#x27;s via postal mail there is literally nothing that needs to be checked or verified.  It&#x27;s one piece of paper that requires no verifying documents and just gets processed.  And it still costs something like $24 in my state.  And for vehicle registration the process is nearly identical and yet it costs $56 where I live.  You&#x27;re argument in this regard doesn&#x27;t hold merit because it is entirely inconsistent, unless you also believe the fees for those should be waived because they are disabled.  And please spare me the &quot;aggravating inequality&quot; nonsense.  All of that is a product of the entitlement mentality that has become far too common.  Most people who are disabled receive a government benefit in some form or another.  So the idea that a very, very small portion of the money that is already taken from others and given to the disabled be used to give them another benefit is not insane, especially when it&#x27;s a voluntary application.  Guess what, things and services cost money.  Asking someone to shell out a pro-rated amount of 50 cents to a dollar a month to have that placard benefit from funds the taxpayers give them is entirely reasonable.<p>Yeah, flat fees do mean more to poorer people.  But basic consumer protection laws dictate that you are supposed to charge like buyers the same rate.  And if the cost of doing whatever costs X, it doesn&#x27;t magically cost less than X because someone is poor.  It still costs X and that money is coming from somewhere.  In the end, all you&#x27;re really arguing for is an additional flat benefit of $25 to be given to anyone who is deemed legally disabled.  Whether it gets paid to them first or is absorbed on the back end doesn&#x27;t mean much, except for perhaps income tax purposes if they received it first so they would have to pay with after tax money (like the rest of us)."

comment,14240484,,,1493665562,,kccqzy,"Not everything can be so easily named. A lot of times mathematicians deal with a much higher level of abstraction than you are, and at that level, there are no intuitive names available. It is not a failing of mathematicians, but rather a failing of human natural language to be unable to name these concepts.<p>You might want to read some very old math books that predated the introduction of symbols to stand for things. Go read how ancient mathematicians express Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem. We have verbose monstrosities that is much more simplified now.<p>Natural language is verbose.

comment,14240469,,,1493665481,,patrick_ranjit,"In my experience (30+), the truly differentiating factor is the nature of your interests outside of work, your energy level. I like to think of it as optimising your contact surface.<p>If your interests are not of a social nature, maybe try something that is. I climb a ton and that sport has resulted in so many new and valuable friendships I couldn&#x27;t even list them here. Also, figure out who you jive with at work, if they have time to hang out and if there are overlapping interests. Invite colleagues to lunch.<p>Making friends take energy, it is like dating really, where you attempt to determine if there&#x27;s a match. It might involve getting a beer or doing activities and generally being outside of ones comfort zone. You&#x27;ll either fail or you&#x27;ll get to a point where you can both relax comfortably. But it is going to be work for a while.<p>Personal anecdote:<p>I was in NY for 3 months for work and my luck was that my primary hobby, climbing, is a very social activity and walking up to strangers is sort of welcomed. I spent the first month never turning down an invitation from colleagues and making an effort of talking to people at the gym. The first month was rather gruelling, and I sometimes felt like I was intruding on people&#x27;s good will and perhaps their pity of me being alone in a new city. But after the initial brutality, my coworkers became comfortable around me and started inviting me to things they went to and I became a part of a small group of regulars at the climbing gym. I made a bunch of friends for life and I miss them dearly now that I am back again."
comment,14240466,,,1493665462,,inthewoods,"I doubt you&#x27;ll ever get an answer as to why the board would allow this to happen, but my guess would be that they were stuck between a rock and a hard place. Perhaps they had to forego a traditional VC investment because their last-round valuation was too high and the existing investors were not willing to either put up more money, or get diluted by raising money at a lower valuation. Second theory would be that they tried to raise a new round and simply had no takers, leading them to the corporate fund raise.<p>So it may not be as simple as eggs in one baset."

comment,14240376,,,1493664878,,SmellTheGlove,"If you have a team of 6, sometimes the best individual 6 people are not the same group of 6 that you put out there to solve a problem.<p>Let&#x27;s continue to use hockey as an example, because I love ill-fitting sports analogies and I also love hockey.  For sure, we already know we need 3 forwards, 2 defensemen and a goalie, so for the sake of argument, even if your 6th best skater is Wayne Gretzky, he&#x27;s going to sit because you need to put Neuvirth in goal (to pick on my own team for a second).  But let&#x27;s think about forward lines only for just a second.  Pittsburgh has Crosby and Malkin centering different lines, even though they&#x27;re the best two guys on the entire team - they do the same job, they&#x27;re playmakers first, goal scorers second (even though Crosby is the league&#x27;s top goal scorer).  Washington has Ovechkin playing the wing with Backstrom, because even though he&#x27;s their best player, his job is to take a pass and fill the net.<p>That&#x27;s a really long-winded way for me to say that &quot;best&quot; has a situational component, and teams have compositional elements that often involve roles.  The 10 best people at that level in the company may all fill the same role, but on a team of 6, maybe there&#x27;s only 3 of that role, and the other 3 are complementary parts.  Best is situational."
comment,14240373,,,1493664851,,sarcher,"Great summation of the issue! ZIP code related issues are a constant problem. Often the administrators of data sets don&#x27;t know how to geocode a full address, and there are few easy ways to have participants record &#x27;good&#x27; geographies. Can you imagine asking people whether they know what Census Block they live in? So we end up with a lot of data sets where ZIP codes become bad short-hand for geography.<p>Last year I worked on a study where the geographic data had been fuzzed prior to passing it along to the study team, a process that unfortunately resulted in the patient addresses being simplified to just the ZIP code provided by the patient.<p>There were two major issues beyond the general unsuitability of ZIP codes as geography: first, ZIP codes don&#x27;t seem to be verified during the course of patient care. They are recorded (incorrectly at a minimum rate of ~0.2%) as a part of a patient address during the creation of the initial record. Even if the address is used for mailings, a bad ZIP does not result in mis-delivered mail in the vast majority of cases due to the availability of city, state, and street address data in the full address. The issue is just never discovered until you are put into the position of relying on only the ZIP code for geography, at which point the mitigating data (the full address) is unavailable.<p>Second, even when ZIP codes do match to Census ZCTAs (the closest thing to &#x27;ZIP code geographies&#x27; available and commonly utilized) there are some ZIP codes that do not have exactly matching ZCTAs. For example, 03911 and 04565 are real ZIP codes without (exact) matching ZCTAs.<p>It would be preferable if address data, before being obfuscated for data anonymity reasons, was properly geocoded. After geocoding, the resulting geography could then be fuzzed for anonymity. Of course, this would just lead to arguments about what constitutes proper diligence in geocoding :)"

comment,14240367,,,1493664824,,alva,"&gt; The second paper suggests that immigration is needed to bring more highly-skilled and highly-educated workers to the U.S.<p>That aspect is indeed covered, however you will notice is a small constituent of what was proposed. Much of the bill is focused on the increased labor participation for low-skilled work (also includes protection for the skilled US jobs, countering that original point) as well as the increased GDP expected due to more people to provide loans to etc. Also, put it in context of the distribution of skill level in the jobs filled by immigration.<p>Any of these papers can be quoted to support either side tbh, it can be quite hard to decipher and see the bigger picture."

comment,14240328,,,1493664586,,danso,"It&#x27;s worth remembering that there are already algorithms used in determining how long a prison sentence should be, such as how much time off an inmate gets for good behavior, and whether there are mitigating factors about the conviction that would reduce the inmate&#x27;s chances of early parole.

comment,14240319,,,1493664549,,kylebenzle,"Exactly, this is not a &quot;big deal&quot; for Bitcoin users or Miners, but for Bitcoin Core Developers this is like a golden ticket. The &quot;Core&quot; Bitcoin implementation, headed by CTO (of BS) Greg Maxwell is currently being overtaken in popularity by the &quot;Unlimited&quot; implementation in mining power. Most of the Bitcoin community (by hashing power) support larger sized blocks and on chain scaling. Greg&#x27;s BS company is trying to sell a solution called &quot;off-chain scaling&quot; which is only necessary if the block size is not increased.<p>One of the largest chip manufactures in the Bitcoin space supports Bitcoin growing on its own and not depending on a 2nd layer support system that is known as &quot;SegWit&quot;. This is why Greg and his company are spending untold sums (like hiring Twitter hype man Samson Mow recently) pushing SegWit Code (which is copyrighted by BS) onto bitcoin, by trying to destory the competitioin with bull shit like saying there is a remote access bug, or some miners are &quot;cheating&quot; by optimizing their chips...<p>Bottom Line. ALL of the superficial infighting you see in the Bitcoin space right now is over scaling on chain as inventor Satoshi Nakamoto intended or using a patented second layer developed by BlockStream, Greg Maxwell&#x27;s company. Most devs in the know, of course, support Bitcoin scaling on its own, but Blockstream is well funded and laser focused on getting their patent code into the Bitcoin codebase and any cost necessary."

This is probably the closest you get to the &quot;overqualified&quot; dismissal excuse more commonly given in other fields. The potential impact on the team could be either small or large, depending on the candidate&#x27;s plan to move himself to a different position.<p>2. To me, it demonstrated a dependence on formalized schooling processes that may signal an inflexibility of mind that makes it difficult to adapt to the fast-moving world of software. He chose to go through this program not because he was programmed to believe it was the only way he could support himself, which is why most people pursue &quot;higher education&quot;, but because he wanted to learn about the business perspective. A strategy that involves getting an MBA is highly inefficient, as discussed elsewhere in this thread."

comment,14240223,,,1493663902,,manyxcxi,"I&#x27;m in complete agreement, but to add to the thought of &quot;Hire the best...&quot; as lazy, I think it&#x27;s just incorrect.<p>The best what? If you&#x27;re talking about a software development team, are you hiring the best software developers? The best devs in what niche? I consider myself a very good developer, but I would be shit for quite a while if I joined a team focusing on embedded systems. Or if I was writing an OS kernel. I would likely get up to speed and surpass some people, but I may never be as good at Y as I am at A, B, and C now. I may just not have the passion for it that I do for those other things.<p>To agree with your point more, assembling a team of &#x27;rockstars&#x27; who are all good at just about the same things means that your team is likely going to have very large blind spots (say: testing, for instance), and contention over people&#x27;s preferences for work. We can&#x27;t all be the architect of a greenfield real time data processing service.<p>I fundamentally believe someone who is engaged, enjoys critical thinking, likes to learn, and is generally good (or at the very least conscientious) at their craft can move from technology stack to technology stack if it aligns with their personal interests and&#x2F;or motivations. I do, however, believe we generally have our sweet spots where we are most apt. Maybe due to our preferences, possibly our aptitude, likely a combination of those and our personal preferences.<p>I consider myself stack agnostic, I float between a half dozen languages a month between professional and personal projects and depending on the problem trying to be solved. But if I sat down and thought about it, a couple of languages would float to the top as my preferred or best, and the rest would be because I&#x27;m good at solving a certain type of problem with them.<p>We can&#x27;t all be the best at everything, but we can be really damn good at some, and together we can go full Voltron and kick ass. It&#x27;s just too hard for someone in HR&#x2F;Talent Acquisition to figure out who should be the leg or the arm (or even what Voltron is), and they&#x27;re likely the filter most candidates must get through.<p>EDIT: To add, I&#x27;m not just ragging on HR&#x2F;Recruiters either. I generally know what I&#x27;m looking for in developers but still consider it hard to interview and hire. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m very good at being the interviewer in the formal interview process. Now, if we had all the time in the world and left the office to grab a pint and just talked like human beings I think I could feel it out better, but now I can&#x27;t get any work done and I&#x27;m going to be drinking 5 days a week until I fill the position."

comment,14240136,,,1493663331,,kazinator,"Walking helps us think only if we don&#x27;t bring any modern distraction such as a mobile device. The main advantage of walking with regard to thinking is that we are away from such things and also away from people. Anyone who wants to get a hold of us to distract our thinking first has to figure out where we are and then track us down on foot. Experience shows that this doesn&#x27;t happen, unless it&#x27;s a very, very urgent matter.<p>Walking helps with difficult problems in coding and design. It helps because often when you get a bad idea that doesn&#x27;t work, and you think it&#x27;s actually a great idea, you still have twenty minutes left to walk.  If you were sitting at the machine, you would be saying, &quot;Eureka!&quot; and coding the bad idea.  If you&#x27;re walking, you&#x27;d like to code the idea, but you can&#x27;t; not yet. So you keep juggling the idea in your mind for the remainder of the walk, by which time you figure out that it was wrong.<p>If you get into a mode where you&#x27;re just trying ideas to see what works, and in the given situation that approach isn&#x27;t working well (however well it might work at other times) walking will physically remove you from that and break the pattern."

There is a pronounced halo effect on association.

Having other options besides being on foot would have been great.<p>I&#x27;ve spent lots of time in Seattle and Los Angeles without a car, and it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but wasn&#x27;t great.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all to say a 24 hour transit system is certainly not a requirement, but it&#x27;s a great thing to have. New York wouldn&#x27;t be New York without it."

comment,14239785,,,1493661000,,jdmichal,"How does this not end with all existent small owners being strong-armed into selling out to capital-heavy investors who can afford to build 20-story towers? Or is the point that it explicitly does not protect them, because they are &quot;under-utilizing&quot; the property?<p>I&#x27;d expect that such a policy would result in a lot of cultural churn, and homogenizing of communities to the point of losing any sort of interesting historical character. How can you have history, when everything is being bought up and redeveloped every (x) years because the previous owners can no longer afford the taxes on the &quot;improved value&quot;.

comment,14239782,,,1493660998,,dvt,"Sooo I totally agree with this concept: that teamwork is more important than individual contribution; that we should focus on teams rather than metrics; and that teams are simply more resilient than other types of organizational structures.<p>Buuut, then the author starts talking about some corporate-bs mumbo-jumbo &quot;skills matrix&quot;. Moneyball is about &quot;black swans&quot; as Nassim Taleb would put it: unexpected outcomes that defy the current knowledge base. In other words, a conclusion that we could not have reached via deduction (but only perhaps abduction).<p>But that goes completely against the &quot;skills matrix&quot; concept. The whole <i>point</i> of Moneyball is that the Oakland players were flawed given standard metrics -- in fact, most were (very calculated) gambles.<p>&gt;The final touch is to match these against levels of mastery. A lower level of skill may be someone who is largely uninformed of the subject, a middle level may be someone who can constantly use that skill well, and a high level is someone who is a mentor and thought-leader.<p>Oh god, he really did miss the point.<p>&gt;With your new chart you are well prepared to decide where to make an investment. Should you hire for a specific weakness? Which team members get what training? Can we run peer mentorship? Do I have unchallenged experts who have no room to grow? Your answers are straight-forward now.<p>Yep. Whoosh. The whole idea of a strategy like Moneyball is that answers are not straightforward. Moneyball is all about intuition vs. evidence. In the case of the A&#x27;s, intuition seemed to trump evidence, but the author keeps telling us to collect more evidence (in the form of matrices, skill trees, or whatever else). Not only is that the categorically wrong approach, it&#x27;s also not how you build good teams."

How long does it take you to walk 10k steps?<p>I&#x27;ve fallen out of the habit lately, but I was hitting the 10k target for a while. I have a sedentary desk job. So chores and playing with my kid got me up to about 3k. Then I&#x27;d walk for an hour during lunch to get another ~7k steps. Walking for an hour every day is fairly substantial commitment. I mean, it felt worth it. As you said, it&#x27;s a huge productivity boost. I&#x27;m probably more productive walking 1 hour and working 7, rather than working a sedentary 8.

comment,14239650,,,1493660280,,danieldk,"<i>So for ~$850, after &#x27;hackintoshing&#x27; this computer, I get:</i><p>The difference is that Apple could do anything to accidentally or intentionally break future updates. It would be in their right to do so, since it is illegal to run macOS on non-Apple hardware [1].<p>I bought a 2016 MBP for 1480 Euro (after the educational discount) and it will always work without a hassle. I don&#x27;t have to worry if the latest minor release that also has security fixes breaks anything. That, plus Apple&#x27;s great support (had to use it twice in 10 years and in both cases I had new or fixed hardware within 2 hours) is worth the extra cost to me.<p>An additional factor is that Apple hardware is often less expensive mid&#x2F;long-term. I now buy a new MacBook every 1.5 years or so, my wife gets my current MacBook, and we sell her old one for 800-1000 Euro. So, we both have state-of-the-art MacBooks for ~400 per 1.5 year, or 133 Euro per year per person. There is a store across the street from my office where they sell second hand Dells and Lenovos. Three year old models go for around 300 Euro. So the resale value on other laptops is pretty bad.<p>Of course, I can understand that when you are on a tight budget, a Hackintosh can be attractive :^). When I was a student, I started with a Hackintosh. But after a month I realised it was easier to get a reasonably-priced Mac Mini ;).<p>[1] I also find it quite risky, unless you verify the Clover + custom kext source code and compile them yourself."

For example it knows which branch of an if it is more likely to be executed, so it can compile that code to native in a way the CPU jump prediction executes the branch that will probably executed at the end. (it is hard to explain without more knowledge but CPUs do optimizations in branches and usually executed one branch before even know the result of the condition, so you sometimes save some cycles, with the dynamic analysis you know which branch is more often executed).

comment,14239611,,,1493660064,,pensieri,"Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA Designer, Infrastructure, Customer Success<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

You have flexibility, and you get what you need.  This is something Apple has been missing for some time now."

This practice wastes everyone&#x27;s time.<p>I agree with you there, notation should be defined, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t help explain anything.<p>However, consider that for people who are already used to the notation those &quot;unnecessary&quot; equations are actually more compact and precise than reading the accompanying text. What seems difficult to you may be easy for someone else, and vice versa.<p>&gt; ... the key to it is to force mathematicians to name their variables.<p>I believe you overestimate how much of an improvement that would be. How much code have you seen that had variables like <i>int num</i> or <i>String str</i>? If <i>num</i> can be any arbitrary number, and <i>str</i> is just a generic string, there isn&#x27;t necessarily a more descriptive name you can use.<p>Mathematics is full of these cases. Say, some general equation involves three real numbers and a real valued function of two real parameters. They are completely generic, so a mathematician might name them <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> and <i>f</i> and write the equation as <i>f(x,y) = z</i>.<p>How would you call them? All I can think of would be <i>the first parameter</i>, <i>the second parameter</i>, <i>the result</i> and <i>the function</i>, which is not much more descriptive for the added verbosity.<p>The problem with using descriptive names in mathematics is that most entities you are dealing with are so generic that naming them doesn&#x27;t help. Of course I&#x27;m not opposed to e.g. writing <i>NormalDistribution</i> instead of just <i>N</i>, since this is actually a very specific concept. But there is just no way to completely eliminate single letter variables from mathematics without using an equally nondescriptive replacement."

The dense townhouse-style constructions have significant non-land cost.  Anecdote from a tiny lot Seattle: 17% of our house &quot;value&quot; is land; the rest is all labor and materials."

comment,14239527,,,1493659639,,basseq,"The problem isn&#x27;t that the Mac Pro isn&#x27;t upgradeable. That is a <i>symptom</i> and a <i>potential solution</i>, but not necessarily the best one.<p>The real problem here is that Apple itself hasn&#x27;t been able to keep up with demands. If they were able to enhance and sell a &quot;new model&quot; of Mac pro every 6-12 months, the problem would go away. Nobody <i>wants</i> a hackintosh, barring the long tail of people who like building PC&#x27;s <i>anyway</i>. (And that&#x27;s an enthusiast market, not worth catering to.) A vast majority of pros would just buy a new machine every couple years. So the <i>problem</i>, then, is that there&#x27;s no &quot;new machine&quot; for them to buy.<p>Positing that the solution is to offer an upgradeable tower implies that Apple can&#x27;t keep up with demand. Which, let&#x27;s be honest, <i>they can&#x27;t</i>. But the better solution here is to build a Mac Pro that <i>Apple</i> can upgrade in the form of a new model. That enthusiasts can upgrade it as well is a moot point (or an additional benefit).<p>Hell, they could even have a Genius-led support model that swaps out the guts of your machine every 12-24 months.
