Ross McCray is a boss who does not believe in the concept of work-life balance. “There is no such thing,” says the 25-year old co-founder of VideoAmp, a digital platform based in Santa Monica, California, that allows advertisers and media owners to interact across different screens or devices.

McCray, who says he thrives on an “above and beyond” culture, follows an extreme workout routine to kick-start his day.

“I wake up every morning at 04:30, regardless, Monday to Sunday, because ultimately I love life and I want to get a lot of stuff done. I can’t really find the amount of time to do everything that I want to accomplish by waking up later.

“I want to be able to inspire people and be the best version of myself. In order to do that, it is very important to be physically and mentally healthy and to get that done in the morning so I can still go to work at around 08:00.”|||
