For their new show, “The Expanse”, we helped Syfy design a set of 3D printable models which they would go on to release to the public. To do so with a bang, we also printed an entire set of all the models for Syfy’s 2016 CES booth display. The amazingly crafted models pulled in both die-hard fans and Syfy newbies, all of whom left with pocket-sized ship models to remind them of the show long after the event ended.|||
