ForthOS was the basis for the author's own experimental software work; unlike many other Forth systems, this one as a real tool in day-to-day use as a part of a larger development. It is a fully standalone system, with a metacompiler used to generate new versions of ForthOS while running under ForthOS. Please read about its legal status; the short version is that ForthOS is in the public domain.

The current version is ForthOS 1.0. Please read about the installation here.

A private newsgroup server existed for a while to permit communication among interested ForthOS users; a read-only archive of it is here.|||
