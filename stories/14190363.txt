This year's annual WeChat report from Tencent research division Penguin Intelligence was released just hours ago. Below are the key findings. Highlights include:

The average number of WeChat contacts has increased significantly over the past year. Large increases in the amounts of money running through WeChat pay from last year. The average age of a WeChat user has shifted significantly in the past year

 Average time spent in WeChat also increased significantly over last year. WeChat is now 66 minutes per day. 83% of respondents now use WeChat for work.

 WeChat pay is used by 93% of those surveyed for offline purchases in tier 1&2 cities in China.

 44.5% of users claimed not carrying cash was a reason to use WeChat pay.

I have combined and reorganized the findings together with parts of the recent WeChat Economic & Social Impact Report from CIACT and added in my personal commentary to highlight important statistics.
