evpp is a modern C++ network library for developing high performance network services in TCP/UDP/HTTP protocols. evpp provides a TCP Server to support multi-threaded nonblocking event-drive server and also a HTTP, UDP Server to support http and udp prococol.

And also provides some libraries based on evpp:

NOTE: master is our development branch and may not be stable at all times.

In our business system, we need to build a TCP long-connection Gateway and other TCP services. When we do a survey of the open sources, we cannot find any appropriate network library for our demands. According to our own business characteristic, an ideal C++ network library must have the features below:

As described above, there are not many options to choose from. So we developed one ourself. The design of the interface is highly inspired by muduo and Golang. Let's take some examples to exaplain this:

In addition, in the implematations we pay seriously attations to thread-safe problems. An event-related resource must be initialized and released in its own thread, so that we can minimize the possibility of thread-safe error. In order to achieve this goal we reimplemented and and other functions. Each call to , we stored the resource into thread local storage, and in the call , we checked it whether it is stored in the thread local storage. And then we checked all the threads local storages to see whether there are resources not destructively released when the process was exiting. The detail codes are here https://github.com/Qihoo360/evpp/blob/master/evpp/inner_pre.cc#L46~L87. We are so harshly pursuit the thread safety to make a program can quietly exit or reload, because we have a deep understanding of "developing a system to run forever and developing a system to quietly exit after running a period of time are totally two diffent things".

The IO Event performance benchmark against Boost.Asio : evpp is higher than asio about 20%~50% in this case

The ping-pong benchmark against Boost.Asio : evpp is higher than asio about 5%~20% in this case

The throughput benchmark against libevent2 : evpp is higher than libevent about 17%~130% in this case

The throughput benchmark against Boost.Asio : evpp and asio have the similar performance in this case

The throughput benchmark against Boost.Asio(中文) : evpp and asio have the similar performance in this case

The throughput benchmark against muduo(中文) : evpp and muduo have the similar performance in this case

The throughput benchmark of evpp is 17%~130% higher than libevent2 and similar with boost.asio and muduo. Although evpp is based on libevent, evpp has a better throughput benchmark than libevent. That's because evpp implements its own IO buffer instead of libevent's evbuffer.

Thanks for the support of Qihoo360.

evpp is highly inspired by muduo. Thanks Chen Shuo|||
