With TensorFlow, deep machine learning transitions from an area of research to mainstream software engineering. In this video, Martin Gorner demonstrates how to construct and train a neural network that recognises handwritten digits. Along the way, he'll describe some "tricks of the trade" used in neural network design, and finally, he'll bring the recognition accuracy of his model above 99%.



Content applies to software developers of all levels. Experienced machine learning enthusiasts, this video will introduce you to TensorFlow through well known models such as dense and convolutional networks. This is an intense technical video designed to help beginners in machine learning ramp up quickly.
