Here at Compelo we are always discussing Twitter, and more specifically, the incredible and varied work of Jack Dorsey. Now what has happened? Twitter starts news stream. Twitter surprises everyone.

We’re looking at what is it and what this will mean for the company everyone in business is talking about right now.

Social-media giant Twitter is joining forces with news outlet Bloomberg to create a new news service. They will steam rolling video news, 24-hours a day, that is produced solely for Twitter. The live video stream will feature original programming, as well as Bloomberg bureau feeds. Pretty cool, right?

“It is going to be focused on the most important news for an intelligent audience around the globe and it’s going to be broader in focus than our existing network,” said Bloomberg Media’s CEO, Justin Smith.

We all know that the media giants are fighting over the ad revenue video brings in. Big brands are putting their TV advert budgets online. For Twitter, this is great news and video accounted for their largest portion of ad revenue in the first quarter.

But competition in this space is fierce. Snapchat, Google’s YouTube and Facebook are all battling it out in this area. Basically that same, singular pot of money has many aggressive bees fighting over it.

However this new move to partner with Bloomberg could be the golden advertising ticket Twitter has been hoping for. Anthony Noto, Twitter’s CFO, said: “We really think we can reach audiences that are not paying for TV and are watching television on the go and we think Bloomberg is the perfect partner for us to start with”.
