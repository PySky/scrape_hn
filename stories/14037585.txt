How many times do you find yourself in a position where you are scrambling for  a gift at the last minute for your partner, friend, family, colleague?  How many times do you feel you are in analysis paralysis of indecision and lack of inspiration?  We are no different.  



We spent some time asking people about their way of finding the perfect gift, but we could not find a common denominator which was satisfactory.  We then started asking what would make a perfect gift?  This is what we heard:

“It should be personal” “It should be unique” “It should be fun and quirky” “It should show love and affection” “It should make the giftee feel special” “It should be a hassle free process for me” “I should feel acknowledged for it”

Considering these pain points of people of want to be giving unique gifts to their loved ones,  we came up with the service Marble.|||
