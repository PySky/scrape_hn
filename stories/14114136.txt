We provide you with secure webhook invocation endpoints that can run your shell scripts on your fleet of servers.

Use request context in your script code For every incoming webhook invocation we parse and store its original context: payload, headers and query parameters. We can export partial or entire values as temporary environment variables you can use in your scripts.

Want to only run your build scripts when a push to the branch occurs? Use trigger rules to customize the exact conditions of when the scripts should be run based on the request context.

Build script was already running when its webhook got invoked again? Don't worry about your script's behavior in the world of concurrency, we provide various strategies so you can specify exactly what should happen based on your own requirements and script code.

We keep the webhook invocation history for a limited amount of time so you can easily review your webhook usage and script behavior. Each historical entry contains the entire request context plus your scripts' outputs.

Your build script failed due to various reasons but it's a hassle to repeat the webhook invocation manually? No worries, you can replay the existing hook invocation with the original request context in a single click!

We use a prepaid, fair-use model, so there won't be any hidden fees or unexpected charges!
