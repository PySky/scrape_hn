Many were very sad when google chose not to update Nexus 10 to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. This simple guide will show you how to build Android 6.0 Marshmallow for Nexus 10. And for the lazy, I also have a pre-built AOSP Marshmallow image set to download on the bottom of this page. Since Nexus 10 was originally a Google-Play-equipped device, you can legally install Google Apps on this image and enjoy a full Google Android 6.0 experience on your Nexus 10. That part, however, is up to you to do yourself. I am not offering GApps downloads here.

For fun, to make this work a few very cool hacks had to be done, read further below in the "cool hacks" section about them, if you care.

Curious information: Due to peculiarities of the ELF format, when a binary baz imports function foo() from libbar.so, nowhere in baz's ELF file does it say that foo() must from from libbar. In fact there are two separate records. One that says that libbar is "NEED"ed, and another that says that there is an import of function "foo". What that means is that if the process were to also load libxyz, which also exported foo(), there is no way to be sure which foo() would get called. Why do we care? Well, consider our problems above. We need to provide functions and variables that existing libraries no longer do. How?

Result: GPS library works on M, with the help of libdmitry and a small binary patch to the GPS library itself (replacing one of the "NEED" records with a NEED record for "libdmitry")

Download patches if you want to make the build yourself: => [ PACKAGE YOU'LL NEED mirror )] <=If you're not a person who wants to build android yourself from source, here is fully usable userdebug image. Tested: Sensors, NFC, WiFi, Bluetooth, Camera, GPS.Fastboot-flashable images here => [ FASTBOOT IMAGES mirror )] <=Or, if you prefer to flash from TWRP => [ TWRP flashable zip mirror )] <=Plase do not re-host this elsewhere and claim this as your work.|||
