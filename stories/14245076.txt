Rosid combines technologies and workflows you might already be familiar with. It's not about reinventing the wheel. It's about making good what's already nice.

Rosid is a server with live-reloading that transforms files as soon as you request them. No need to save pre-processed files anymore.

Use technologies and a project structure you are familiar with. We won't force you to use what we use. That's why Rosid is as flexible as possible.

We don't reinvent the wheel. Rosid is powered by popular modules like Browsersync and only adds a small, modular layer on top of it.|||

Just-in-time server and static site generator written in Node.js. Rosid transforms your files on-the-fly before serving them to the browser.
