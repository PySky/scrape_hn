Some stories on HN are a complete waste of time.  Little real knowledge is ever included in the threads.  No one learns anything. We just bullshit for a few hours.  And this happens a few times a year for each topic.

My first suggestion is stories related to immortality. Most of the comments immediately turn  philosophical.

“It’ll only be for rich people”

“The money should be spent on something better.”

On HN, most people don’t  want to learn anything about aging.  No one discusses the basic science that we might gain by doing the research.  The knowledge gained could have benefits in other areas of medicine like heart disease and cancer, for example.  You aren’t going to want to live forever and have Alzheimer’s.

There are 7 billion people on the planet.  It’s not going to hurt if several thousand people work on basic research to understand aging.  From reading the current news headlines, robots and AI, will  soon leave many people without jobs. Perhaps basic research in all areas of science should be expanded to create jobs?

Finally, let’s not delude ourselves into thinking that death is going to be any easy disease to cure.  Maybe we’ll get a few breakthroughs over the next couple of decades and we’ll figure out how to add a few extra healthy years to the average person.  We definitely need to move beyond long term studies and peer deeper into our bodies.  By the way, the latest study says we need to take 15,000 steps a day to live a longer life.|||
