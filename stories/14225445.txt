News site kramola.info.russia interviewed the officer of the Russian army Eugene Gavrikov.

He tells about his experience in Antarctica and confirm that there really is a pyramid hidden in the midst of the icy mountains and there are traces of military infrastructure left by the Third Reich and signs of activity from the past.

Eugene also states that the U.S. are aware of what happens in Antarctica where satellites showed the Ozon hole which could not be attributed to human activities but by something more mysterious.

There are many mysteries around the Antarctic, theories which connect Operations Paperclip and High-Jump, to secret hidden bases and ancient technologies, human experimentation and discovered hidden entrances.

While the mainstream recently reported on further explorations in the Antarctica which they claim "holds the key" to mankind's future", what they do not do is connect the many dots which build a picture that appears to blur the lines between conspiracy and reality.|||
