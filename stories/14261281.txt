I'm working on a project called zero/divide -it is a merit-centric organisation inspired by a team of innovative creators, artists, and entrepreneurs. The open knowledge platform is a community driven learning environment that encourages curiosity, debate, and leadership across the generation-spectrum. Privately, we offer bespoke classroom, e-learning, and collaboration solutions geared towards small-medium biz profiles covering a broad spectrum from consumer software to humanities and even the arts.

Ideal candidates exhibit strong cords of personal growth and a persistant desire to both gain and share knowledge across borders.

This is a challenging task and I need some help in identifying key specific concerns in the Edu realm so that I can craft a solution that will incite a paradigm shift in leadership principles that are currently arresting the development of well respected speakers and influencers in this continent.

Please help me by Asking Me Anything?

Thank you all for your input!
