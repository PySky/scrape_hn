The new industrial and technology hub will be a 2,000 hectare 

 city and it is hoped that it will provide 100,000 jobs and house 300,000 inhabitants according to Morocco's Industry Minister, Moulay Hafid El Alamy. Given the size and scale of the project, the timelines given are that it will take 10 years to complete it.

The industrial and technology hub will be divided into various industrial zones spanning different sectors including aeronautics, automobiles, 

 telecommunications, renewable energy, and transport equipment.
