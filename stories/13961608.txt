jpgAgent is a job scheduler for PostgreSQL written in Java. It is low overhead, and aims to be fully compatible with pgAgent.

The reason for writing a pgAgent compatible job scheduler is to be able to utilize the tools already in place for pgAgent in the pgAdmin UI, minimizing the pain of switching for existing pgAgent users (uses the same database schema), and provide a more stable and feature rich implementation of the agent.

We support killing a job through Listen/Notify channels in Postgres. It was implemented this way to be the easiest to use without extending the UI to support it.

Annotations can be added at the job, and job step level. Annotations are added in the job comment field, or job step description field, must be on their own line, and in the correct format.

Annotations that take a time measurement support different suffixes for the value [ms, s, m, h].

Annotations that take a JOB_STATUS support the values of: [FAIL;SUCCEED;ABORTED;IGNORE]

Annotations that take a JOB_STEP_STATUS support the values of: [FAIL;SUCCEED;ABORTED;IGNORE]

You can create a file which contains your arguments, and pass that into the program instead. This will protect the password from showing up in logs. The file can be created anywhere on your filesystem, and must contain the arguments in this format:

The remote connection parameter in the job step configuration is not supported, we instead use annotations to allow connections to remote servers. Reasoning for this is due to the extended functionality of our annotations, the single connection string for a remote server was too limiting.

If the database you are trying to connect to is not on the database server jpgAgent is configured for, you can pick any database in the list (usually the maintenance db) and configure the one you actually want to connect to in an annotation.|||
