We've all been there. That moment when someone says something unbelievably silly, otherworldy silly even, that you don't know what to do. For a long time even our ancestors didn't know what to do, how to express their reaction.

But somewhere, in a remote part of the world someone realized that raising your arm to cover your face, expresses exactly the reaction needed. Thanks to the internet, we all came to know it as the facepalm.

But for a long time people in a lot of parts of the world the facepalm wasn't the default reaction. It took a long time to get where we are now, centuries spent in the darkness of not knowing it, so we should be very grateful to be here now.

We take moments like these very seriously at Appticles. This is why we've renamed one of our most popular themes - Palm to Facepalm. We want to raise awareness to one of the most widely used and yet very underappreciated reactions we've come to know.

With this we want to start a campaign, and we want you all to join us, we want to bring this reaction to Facebook, so we'll never ever forget about it.|||

April Fools' Day (sometimes called All Fools' Day) is celebrated every year on April 1 by playing practical jokes and spreading hoaxes. The jokes and their victims are called April fools.
