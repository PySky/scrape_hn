 This event took place somewhere in Turkey, this is the story: A girl came at the gas station, she missed the lane and hit into the sidewalk, but instead of braking she pressed the gas pedal and caused a disaster. She hit the car that was parked in front of her and almost killed a man that was near by, but that wasnâ€™t enough so she continued her journey straight into the gas station. Luckily there was no one in front of her when she crashed inside, but she literally destroyed the gas station. This event is covered by four security cameras, so watch the video below to see what actually happened inside and outside of the gas station.|||
