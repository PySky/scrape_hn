Snapchat users in India have been deleting the app since learning about a comment allegedly made by Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel in 2015.

“This app is only for rich people,” Spiegel allegedly said at the time, during discussions about Snapchat's overseas growth. “I don’t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.”

The comments came to light after former employee Anthony Pompliano filed a lawsuit in January alleging that the app falsified its user metrics. Much of that lawsuit was redacted for public view and only became available this week.

Pompliano, who spent three weeks with the company, was hired to work on Snapchat's growth, and he alleges that Spiegel dismissed "poor countries" when discussing Snapchat's growth in related markets.

"Snap did not give investors misstated user metrics back in 2015; nor did Snap employees commit any of the panoply of alleged bad acts that litter Pompliano's complaint," Snap wrote in the notice it filed with the court to unseal the complaint. "Snap will demonstrate as much at the appropriate time in the appropriate forum." The company declined to comment further.

UPDATE: April 17, 2017, 8:29 a.m. EDT Snapchat has denied that the company see its app as only for people in certain countries.

Now that users in the market Spiegel allegedly insulted are hearing about his comments, they're deleting the app. With the hashtag #UninstallSnapchat, users in India are sharing the reasons why they're getting rid of the app.

Will #UninstallSnapchat be the next #DeleteUber? Time will tell. Until then, try Instagram.|||
