Once again, I didn't intend to make a video about this adventure. This one was going to be just for me. I read about this great hike on a cool site I stumbled across:

It looked like Harding Falls was a little trafficked amazing waterfall. I made the decision not to bring my video camera because I didn't want to blow this place up with tons of people. After doing the hike, I don't think that will be a problem, lol. This hike is definitely NOT for everyone. You have to be in great shape and have a good eye for poison oak, which is abundant. There is occasionally a small, unmaintained trail near the creek, but mostly you are rock hopping, scrambling or bouldering most of the 6 hour round trip for this one. It's worth it to have this 40' and 15' two-tiered beauty all to yourself!



NO SALAMANDERS WERE HARMED DURING THE FILMING OF THIS VIDEO. He was ok and swam away after falling into the water.
