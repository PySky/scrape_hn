Peru 8K HDR explores the people and landscapes of Peru. This footage was captured in natively in 8K UHD (4320p) and 60fps resolution with the brand new Red Helium 8K Super35mm sensor. Using the most up to date technology we created this video to deliver the most realistic and cinematic experience possible today, especially when viewed in HDR!

Shot over 2 weeks traveling all over our the beautiful country of Peru: from Lima, to the amazon in Iquitos, Cusco, Ollantaytmbo and of course the stunning Machu Picchu, Puno where we visited Lake Titicaca and then traveling further into the lake to the inner island of Taquile. 



We want to share with everyone how we see the world in 8K.
