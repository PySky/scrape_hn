Ripple is an accessory that encourages the experience of courtship in daily life, by scanning your surroundings to work out who is attracted to you. Ripple widens women’s perception by giving them physical sensations to point out who is showing interest in them. If the interest is mutual, Ripple perceives these natural reactions and amplifies the flirtatious language by moving in response to the suitors gaze.

Our increased uptake of digital technology has led us to be more immersed in a virtual world. We are less present in real life, making it harder for us to communicate with others face to face. Although we are constantly surrounded by people, we behave as if we were on our own. We believe that our eyes always communicate, longing to connect with others. Ripple enhances this channel, and expands our awareness of what is happening around us.|||
