The editor needs to reload Sorry, the editor needs to be reloaded before we can save any more changes. This may be because you have signed out of Overleaf in another window or cleared your cookies, or because the Overleaf application has been updated. The page will be automatically reloaded in

There was a problem storing your edit. Sorry, we could not store your latest edit. This can happen if you type or copy and paste (e.g. from a PDF) text that uses certain unicode symbols, including emoji and some mathematical symbols, directly into your source code rather than using the TeX commands that produce those symbols. Please use the TeX commands instead. You can find the commands for symbols using this tool. Please reload the page to continue editing.
