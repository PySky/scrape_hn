A citizen proposal system delivers a powerful framework for civilian legislation.  It fixes the broken systems we have today, such as in California, where the only proposals to get through are watered down or bought and paid for by Big Money.  Anyone can put forth a proposal to Cicada, but only useful proposals will ever make it to a national vote.  Each proposal is routed randomly to a small group of people.  If it doesn’t get enough votes, it dies.  If it gets voted down it never goes anywhere.  Only If the majority likes it, the proposal passes to the next stages: ever-increasing groups of more and more voters.  Only the best ideas will ever make a national vote.  Bad ideas idea die.  Good ideas live.  Simple.  Nobody can buy their way to the top.|||
