We’re proud to announce support for Kubernetes 1.6.2 in the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes and the Kubernetes Charms. This is a pure upstream distribution of Kubernetes, built with operators in mind. It allows operators do deploy, manage, and operate Kubernetes on public clouds, on-premise (ie vSphere, OpenStack), bare metal, and developer laptops. Kubernetes 1.6.2 is a patch release comprised of mostly bugfixes.

Here’s the simplest way to get a Kubernetes 1.6.2 cluster up and running:



During the installation conjure-up will ask you what cloud you want to deploy on and prompt you for the proper credentials. If you’re deploying to local containers (LXD) see these instructions for localhost-specific considerations.

For production grade deployments and cluster lifecycle management it is recommended to read the full Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes documentation.

To upgrade an existing 1.5.x or 1.6.x cluster, follow the upgrade instructions in the docs. Following these instructions will upgrade the charm code and resources to the Kubernetes 1.6.2 release of the charms.

We’re normally found in these Slack channels and attend these sig meetings regularly:

Operators are an important part of Kubernetes, we encourage you to participate with other members of the Kubernetes community!

We also monitor the Kubernetes mailing lists and other community channels, feel free to reach out to us. As always, PRs, recommendations, and bug reports are welcome!|||
