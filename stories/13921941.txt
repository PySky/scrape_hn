“The ICO has data protection compliance concerns about SystmOne’s enhanced data sharing function and the potential risk to patients’ medical records held by GPs.

“However, given the possible impact to patient care, the ICO is not advocating that users switch off data sharing at this stage.

“The ICO’s concerns are centred on the fair and lawful processing of patient data on the system and ensuring adequate security of the patient data on the system. We continue to work closely with TPP, NHS Digital and NHS England and have seen an initial plan that they have put forward. This includes initial steps they are taking to remedy these issues and further work is planned.”|||
