HoloLems is a holographic spatial platformer and homage to the classic 90's video game Lemmings. Put on the Hololens headset and be challenged to safely guide a group of holographic lemmings through a number of real world obstacles (your furniture, your sleeping cat!) to a designated exit.

HoloLems was lovingly produced by Globacore Interactive Technologies in Toronto, Canada.|||
