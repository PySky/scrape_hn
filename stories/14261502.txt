Python wrapper for multiple APIs, that provide catchments-areas. It allows to acquire and manipulate catchments from those APIs. It can help you answer the questions like: "Where can I get in 30 min from that point?" taking into account e.g. real traffic, transport type, specified range.

Currently there are implemented two classes: SkobblerAPI("api_key") and HereAPI("app_id", "app_code").

You can use them as follows:

As you can see .get_catchment method uses params as second argument. Params keys names should be exactly the same as mentioned in APIs documentations, otherwise they will be ignored and default values will be used.

Params supported by SKOBBLER and HERE:

You can use also inbuilt command line scripts which accept *.csv file input with points as coordinates resource. Scripts generate *.geojson files for every point in given *.csv file.

Example *.csv file structure (name column is optional):

All scripts and their options are mentioned below:|||
