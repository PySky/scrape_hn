At FastFit we developed our own ab routine that, in our opinion, puts crunches and sit ups to shame! The greatest thing about it is, you can do this routine from anywhere. Whether you are traveling or on vacation, there really isn't an excuse not to complete it. We know you will feel good about it.

This routine consists of 5 exercises and will take 20 minutes or less to complete. Rest in between sets for about 30 seconds and move on to the next exercise. We like this routine because it keeps the workout entertaining, and it targets both upper and lower abdominal muscles as well as your obliques.

If your abs aren't burning by the end then you aren't doing it correctly. For us we start to feel it half way into the leg raises! We attached some videos for each link (not our videos) to show you how each workout is performed.

Complete 50 reps, we count 3 flutters as one rep, but if you want to count per flutter then you need to count 150 individual flutters to complete it.

If you are just starting out try cutting this in half.

Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion, make sure not to have your feet touch the ground as they come down (very important).

Perform the plank extension for a total of 60 seconds.

Perform the side planks for a total of 30 - 60 seconds each side.

We are always trying to change up our ab routines to keep it exciting and also to confuse the abdominal muscles.
