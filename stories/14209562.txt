The original librados rados_objects_list_open (C) and objects_begin

 (C++) object listing API, deprecated in Hammer, has finally been

 removed. Users of this interface must update their software to use

 either the rados_nobjects_list_open (C) and nobjects_begin (C++) API or

 the new rados_object_list_begin (C) and object_list_begin (C++) API

 before updating the client-side librados library to Luminous.

Object enumeration (via any API) with the latest librados version

 and pre-Hammer OSDs is no longer supported. Note that no in-tree

 Ceph services rely on object enumeration via the deprecated APIs, so

 only external librados users might be affected.

The newest (and recommended) rados_object_list_begin (C) and

 object_list_begin (C++) API is only usable on clusters with the

 SORTBITWISE flag enabled (Jewel and later). (Note that this flag is

 required to be set before upgrading beyond Jewel.)|||
