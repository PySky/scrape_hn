There are so many things, most small, that can be done. I'll keep it to two that have helped me:

As someone who's been on both sides of the table (or same, just different seats?), my biggest recommendation is to always explain why they're being asked to do something.

Some things are fun to work on. Some aren't. Being in the dark about how anything you're doing affects the business is frustrating, and worse when what you're working on is a slog. Giving everyone insight into the why, and why things change in priority goes a very long way.

While many engineers I worked with know I was an engineer, I backed off the how. That's on them. No matter where your technical expertise level is, you need to trust them. If you can, help them, but the how is their job, and their call.|||
