Usage of this software requires a compatible YubiKey device. Yubico Authenticator is capable of provisioning and using both slot-based credentials (compatible with any YubiKey that supports OTP) as well as the more powerful standalone OATH functionality found on the NEO and YubiKey 4 series. To use the standalone OATH functionality your YubiKey must have the CCID mode enabled, which can be done by using the YubiKey Manager.|||
