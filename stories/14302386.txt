In August of 2016, we launched Amium, a collaboration tool that combined chat and file sync that enabled users to keep their collaboration in one place. Instead of having files all over the place — on your computer, in a file sync app in the cloud, and in email — Amium was a place for teams to work together on files and have conversations. With thousands of users signed up, it was clear we were headed in the right direction.

The most common feature request we received from our users was for a way to collaborate not just within a team, but across teams and companies, including your clients, vendors, and even customers. This use case was particularly common amongst organizations that deal with many external stakeholders (e.g. engineering firms, marketing teams, design agencies, and freelancers).

And today we’re happy to announce a major new release of Amium that lets you do just that. It’s great for creative agencies, freelancers, and anyone who collaborates with people outside their immediate team.

Our marketing team works with many agencies and freelancers that help us get work done, including an outside PR team, SEO firm, graphics designers, and event managers. Amium allows us to invite all of them to separate projects, where we can work together on presentations, graphics, Word documents, or PDFs. Everything is synced so everyone has the latest version, and the conversation is saved so we know how we got there. Our outside agencies do not need to create a new account just to work with us, either. They can use the same Amium account to work with all of their customers.|||
