Deezer, the music streaming platform, has said that their new service for discovering emerging artists, Deezer Next, is now available in South Africa.

According to the music streaming service, Deezer Next will promote music artists to new audiences and also enable music listeners to discover the "next generation of stars.”

For South Africa, the four artists have been announced for Deezer Next and they are Dominic Neill, Raheem Kemet, Southern Wild & Robin Thirdfloor who spoke to us about how the Internet is a game changer for music artists.

As part of the Deezer Next offering, the service says it will work directly with the selcted emerging artists, record labels and their managers to help develop their profile through play-listing and the creation of individual content and campaigns with editorial and marketing support across all channels, including video, podcast, social and/or interactive.

"Deezer NEXT is all about helping you find your new favourite artist. We’ve been working hard over the last few months to put together a list of 12 acts we think are set for big things in the UK and Ireland in 2017. We’ve trawled thousands of tracks, travelled to gigs all over the country and, after hours locked in a room arguing about who should make the cut, come up with this final list." the company said in a statement.

Deezer Next has already been rolled out globally and the South Africa announcement is the first for Afrika.|||
