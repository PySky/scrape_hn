The v5ProBasic PEMF device offers you all the power of the full featured v5Pro EarthPulse™ with Manual Mode program only.

Two electromagnetic inductors at up to 1100 Gauss peak. That’s up to 2200 peak gauss applied locally! Tons of power for even the thickest mattresses up to 18 inches (45 cm) thick.

You may choose any frequency between 1 Hz and 14.1 Hz. Choose your favorite frequency for sleep, set timer and go to sleep. In the morning the frequency will jump to 14.1 Hz for an hour at end of timer to help you wake refreshed.

Our staff use Manual Mode setting almost exclusively now; set to 9.6 Hz exactly, or one of its lower harmonics @ 4.8 Hz or 3.6 Hz Theta, 2.4 Hz or 1.2 Hz Delta. Find out why 9.6 Hz works so well on our research portal. We find no matter which of the 9.6 Hz or lower harmonic settings are used, recovery is super FAST. Speed of recovery at these lower harmonics is indistinguishable from 9.6 Hz.|||

PEMF Device - ProBasic (dual magnet) is great for sleep & recovery. Tune to a frequency between 0.5 - 14.1 Hz . This PEMF device provides remarkable effects.
