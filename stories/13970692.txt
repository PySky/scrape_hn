Bitcoin is the future and I still believe in it. I was fascinated when I heard about bitcoin in 2012. But I didnt trust it enough to buy them. The buying price then was $5.

I have heard a lot by 2015 about bitcoin and how its the currency of future.

So I put in around $300 (Rs.14000) in a website called igot to purchase 1 BTC. The site was reputed, top in google search I transfered the amount into their bank account(Reputed Indian bank).

Finally I got the amount converted to 1 BTC and they have a wallet that holds the bitcoin. After few months on June 2016 I requested them to transfer the bitcoin to an external wallet, but they did not transfer.

After 4 months I get an email that your transaction for transfering the bitcoin was cancelled. I ignored the email as I was busy.

When I logged in to the account my bitcoin wallet showed “0”(ZERO) balance.I immediately raised a ticket to support team to know whats happening.

The reply I got on was as below:

This is how the scam is done. A bitcoin that is worth around $1000 at present was refunded to me at the price of the date that I traded my bitcoin i.e $310 (approx.)

Its like they took my money invested in Bitcoin and when the bitcoin started gaining , they took it away and returned the money.

And now I feel its impossible to get the bitcoin back because the Indian government does not support the Bitcoin.

Hope this article helps someone from getting into such scams.|||
