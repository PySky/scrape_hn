I don’t like karaoke, no offense.

My company covered all of my conference trips, wonderful. 

Those 2 seemingly unrelated things were the cause of my anxiety.

I love to attend conferences. Being in that environment has so much more value than sitting in front of a laptop and watching from Confreaks (not blaming the service at all, on the contrary, I appreciate it very much). I just love being in the present. I love the heat and the vitality, which always stimulates me into delving deeper and wider.

For conferences I went by myself, I was free. I listened to the talks, got inspired, afterwards, I went home. No strings attached. Normally I would not attend the afterparty, or go karaoke. I’m not anti-social. I’m just not social.

But these company-paid trips were different. The recent 2 conferences I attended were Full Stack Fest 2015 in Barcelona and Rails Pacific 2016 in Taipei, and both times, my company paid. We were one of the sponsors. We didn’t have a specific number of people to contact or even hire, but we vaguely did. And observing my colleagues socializing, networking, going out for drinks, directly or indirectly spreading word of our company (but not that hard like a persistent salesman), I had this urge to also participate, but knowing that I’ll be uncomfortable with all those social activities, I became anxious.

Nobody forced me, it was all me! I wanted to help, to contribute in some way to give back to my company. Yet I couldn’t seem to figure out how.|||
