By default, every WordPress installation will contain the same core files with the same names and the same locations. While this is a good solution for developers, who can easily navigate through their themes and plugins to get specific content, at the same this is a huge security risk. If someone decides to access your core files, which include your WP-Content folder where all theme, plugin, and uploaded files are, he would already know the path to your stuff.

In one of our previous articles, we showed you how to hide the entire folder or its subfolder from curious people. Instead of simply hiding your folder, you may want to think about relocating it or even renaming the entire folder.

IMPORTANT: Before you do any changes to wp-config.php file, make sure that you create a backup of the file just in case something goes wrong. When the backup is ready, you can go on and move your wp-content folder on to another location:

If you want to rename your wp-content folder, you can do that with the following code which needs to be added in wp-config.php as well:

The changes you have made in the wp-config.php file only tell WordPress where to look for your wp-content directory. If you go on and check your media files, for example, you will see that all images you already have are linking to the new directory. To make everything work correctly, make sure that you physically move the directory into a new location which you have defined in the code above.

While all these changes will make your site more secure, be careful if doing so; making the changes may stop your themes and plugins from working so make the changes only if youâ€™re sure you can move the folder without getting into problems.|||

In order to make your files safe, if possible, make sure that you relocate and rename WordPress folder. Follow these steps in order to do so.
