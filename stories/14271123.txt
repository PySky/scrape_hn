Worried about losing your job to a damn robot? Don’t be, says Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.17%

Schmidt visited MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab on Wednesday night, where he discussed the thorny topic of automation and the threat posed to the workforce, according to published reports.

But, unlike so many other notable business leaders, he’s not exactly sounding the alarm. In fact, he used these words to describe his stance:

He went on to explain his view.

“I’ve just decided I’m going to be contrarian, because the data supports me, and it’s more fun to be in opposition anyway,” Schmidt said, as quoted by CNBC. “There’s no question that there’s job dislocation. But there [are] always new solutions. The economic folks would say that you can see the job that’s lost, but you very seldom can see the job that’s created.”

Self-aware robots aside, Schmidt also vented on limitations on hiring skilled immigrants, saying policy restrictions like that make it tougher for the U.S. companies compete on the global stage.

“The stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas,” he said. “We want the best people in the world, regardless of any form of sex, race, country, what-have-you. We want them to work for us and not our competitors.”|||
