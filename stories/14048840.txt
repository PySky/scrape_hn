Facebook now has over 170 million monthly active users in Afrika and of these, 94% get on the social network on mobile.

This revelation was made as Facebook's regional office for Africa moved to larger premises in Johannesburg, South Africa.

“Since we first established a direct presence in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015, Facebook has grown from strength to strength,” says Nunu Ntshingila, Regional Director, Africa, Facebook.

Given this growth, the Facebook Africa team is also growing and necessitated a need to move to larger offices.

“We have enjoyed working closely with entrepreneurs, partners, developers and small businesses as they have used Facebook as a platform for growth. It’s inspiring for us to learn from the continent and to play a role in helping people and organisations connect with the world.” Ntshingila added.

Facebook executives Carolyn Everson, VP Global Marketing Solutions and Nicola Mendelsohn, VP EMEA, also attended the launch of the new office together with Ntshingila.
