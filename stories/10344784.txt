After another long delay, we are finally happy to announce a new release of Geany!

For a comprehensive list of changes please see Release Notes. A very detailed and complete list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog.

We want to thank all developers, translators and everyone who contributed to this release with patches, feedback, bug reports and so on. Thank you!

As usual, all downloads can be found on Releases. But this time you'll also find a MacOS X DMG, thanks to Jiří Techet!

Additionally, to try and avoid another long delay before the next version, we decided to try and embrace a time-based 4 months release schedule. If we can stick to it, next release should come out around November 15.|||
