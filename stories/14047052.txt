Infrastructure is critical to the fabric of the internet, as well as to conducting business across the globe. For Google Cloud customers in particular, better internet means means better business operations, better user experiences and the ability to serve even more customers.

Many people are coming online across Asia, including businesses that depend on the cloud. That's why it's so important to enable better internet connectivity across the region, and why Google, alongside AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel, SubPartners and Telstra, is building a new international subsea cable system in Southeast Asia, called INDIGO. The new cable system will serve Google traffic between Australia and Asia, connecting Perth, Sydney and Singapore, with a branch to Jakarta. Alcatel Submarine Networks will construct the cable, which is expected to be completed by mid-2019.|||
