We saved our MNIST characters, time to visualise it! If you did not change any of the variables above you can run the visualisation with:

Now open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:6006 (note: this can change depending on your computer setup). You should see this after navigating to the Embeddings tab (note: if you have an older tensorflow version you will NOT see the Embeddings tab. This can only be resolved by upgradeing Tensorflow):

Click the embeddings tab to see the PCA of our MNIST digits. Click on the left on the “color by” selector and select the Label. You probably see some nice groupings (zeroes close to each other, sixes close to each other, etc.).



 You can also try T-SNE to see the digits move around while they are trying to form groups.
