Are you aware that the products you design might be ignoring and even rejecting groups of people altogether? While design aims to be a force for good, it also has the ability to divide and exclude.

Automattic, the makers of WordPress are gathering leaders in the design and technology community to discuss this very issue at the Design and Exclusion conference. The aim of the conference is to help the design and technology community understand how our actions can negatively affect people and talk about ways to make more inclusive and inviting products.

Design And Exclusion will take place remotely on April 21st, 2017 at 12 pm ET and 9 am PT.Â Visit the Design and Exclusion website to learn more about the keynote speakers and panelists who will be sharing their expertise.
