Wow, the bubbles just keep on coming! For whatever reason qwikrazr87 has just released his bubble trick, now these bubbles are very easy to make and are nothing like the rebirth bubbles. All you need is one of the exploits listed but if you have access to your MS0: inside the PSVita or PlayStation TV on FW  3.36 and below you can place qwikrazor87 special pboot inside any game in your game folder. Some games work better then others, as you can use some minis, but I would not recommend it.

Another good thing about these bubbles is that you can rebuild the PSVita database and they will stay intact, so if you swap memory sticks around they won’t disappear.

Here is what qwikrazor had to say about his release.

These 3.52 files can be used on 3.51.

Now that this has been released I will release my pboot for TN-V11 for 3.50fw and below. I just need some time to get everything ready for a release. So please bare with me for the time being.

NOTE: I do not recommend leaving FW 3.52 for 3.55fw as you will lose so many good things like custom bubbles, themes and etc..

He has also released bubbles for FW3.50 users, but these bubbles will only work on FW3.50 or FW3.36

Here is what he had to has about these bubbles.|||
