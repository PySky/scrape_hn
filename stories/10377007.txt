This is a Material Theme port of both the IDE and Color scheme for JetBrains products.

Please note: This is a work in progress. There are some work to be done before this can be considered stable.

Thanks to the awesome guys at JetBrains the plugin is now supported on pretty much all IDEs from the same company. There are still some work to do to get it perfect on all IDEs, but we're close.

This plugin will not set the new color scheme for you, as that would cause a couple problems. You need to set the new color scheme manually:

Shortcut: (that's a backtick) then hit and select your desired color scheme.

Import the project from the file and develop as normal. Make sure you select JDK 8 in the import wizard. The other defaults are fine. You can run the above mentioned CLI Gradle tasks directly in the "Gradle" Tool Window, which expands from the right side of the screen. To debug, find "runIdea" in the list, right-click it, and choose Debug.

I would love to get some help on the colour schemes. Send me a pull request!

Thanks to @equinusocio for making the Color Scheme.

Thanks to all contributors and a special thanks to the guys at JetBrains for contributing and showing interest in the project!|||
