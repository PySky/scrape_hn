Version 2.3.4 of pfSense, a specialist FreeBSD-based operating system designed for firewalls and routers, has been released:

“We are happy to announce the release of pfSense software version 2.3.4. This is a maintenance release in the 2.3.x series, bringing stability and bug fixes, fixes for a few security issues, and a handful of new features. On the 2.3.4-RELEASE Dashboard you’ll find a few additional pieces of information – the BIOS vendor, version, and release date (if the firewall can determine them) and a Netgate Unique ID. The Netgate Unique ID is similar to a serial number, it is used to uniquely identify an instance of pfSense software for customers who want to purchase support services. For hardware sold in our store, it also allows us to tie units to our manufacturing records. This ID is consistent across all platforms (bare metal, virtual machines, and hosted/cloud instances such as AWS/Azure). We had originally intended to use the hardware serial number or the UUID generated by the operating system, but we found that these were unreliable.”|||
