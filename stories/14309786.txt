Originally Highrise was built for Jason and David, the founders of Basecamp, who had trouble staying on top of who was talking to the lawyer, who needed to follow up with the landlord, what was said to the reporter, etc.

But do our customers look like Jason and David?

Maybe they did originally but things changed over the last decade Highrise has been in business? Is that still our reason for existing? So we recently did a series of Jobs-to-be-Done interviews to understand who uses Highrise at a deeper level.

Our interviews uncovered that Highrise was now in the hands of a very different group of people with very different needs. It’s less about “Contacts” and more about “Leads” someone needs to get into a sales process. It’s less about “Todos” and “Tasks” and more about “I need a reminder to follow-up with this lead in a few weeks.” But that’s just functionality and how it’s communicated.

The core job we saw people looking for was a system to track leads and manage follow-ups that needs to be turned on immediately. No manual required. So, it’s less about: “I need robust pipeline analytics”, and more about “I need this system to be running yesterday.”

With this insight in front of us, there’s a lot of options. How should we change the product? The marketing site? How can we get in front of more people who look like these customers?

But I’m not one to put all my resources in long term projects. We need quick experiments, quick lessons, and hopefully quick wins along the way.

So I took our current marketing site, and gave it a very fast redesign. Can I change the headlines and copy to match what our customers say about the product?|||
