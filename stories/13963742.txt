First install Lumen if you don't have it yet:

Then install Lumen Passport (it will fetch Laravel Passport along):

Or if you prefer, edit manually:

Implement an authentication system, I suggest you to use "passport", for Lumen you can check this: https://github.com/dusterio/lumen-passport/

This package provides a simple way to create permissions for your application.

In the users table you have to assign to the user an auth level.

In the authorizations table you can create the permissions.

For each sentence you can see its implementation in the authorizations table.

The user with authorization 0 can see the id of everyone

The user with authorization 1 can see the email and the username of everyone

The user with authorization 2 can edit every field for his cars

When you create a new model instead of extending Model, you have to extend AuthorizationScopes.

Inside every model you can user the following scopes to filter your queries.

All the scopes also work with relations, in every Model you have to create a public parameter called own. That is the field linked with the user's id.
