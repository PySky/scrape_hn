AngularJS Module to enable action trigger for textarea on pressing the key.

It removes the default behaviour of creating a new line, when key is pressed against any textarea element, instead as soon as the key is pressed, the method attached to the directive can be called and can be used to access the model associated with the textarea element.

To create usual newlines, a combination of , and keys can be used.

You can install the package using bower. Make sure you have bower installed, then run :

Or, download the latest version and include to your project.

Add as a dependency in your angular app module.

Add the directive as an attribute to any textarea element and pass in a method, which will be called on pressing the key.

Now everytime key is pressed against this textarea, the will be called, no newline will be created. In this case it is logging the value of scope variable out to the console.
