I used Facebook for several years and than I took 2 years pause. Now I can’t login anymore. I can’t update my account, I can’t update or delete my website’s fan page.

I sent them my government-issued ID. It’s more than 4 months now and nothing happens. I wanted to confirm my identity another way by clicking on link you can see on the image above and I’m getting this:

This is sick! I can do nothing. Account is inactive, fan page is active showing old irrelevant content. They have my government-issued ID scan and can do whatever they want with it. I have nothing. Terrible attack on privacy!

If you know some way how to solve this please send me a comment.|||
