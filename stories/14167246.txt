Slitheen is a new proposal for a decoy routing system. Decoy routing systems enslist the help of Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems that exist outside of a censor's area of influence to provide censorship resistance to clients that are under the influence of a nation-state censor.

Slitheen provides a strong defense against both active and passive attacks by requesting overt, allowed content and replacing the leaf resources of this content with censored material. Rather than mimicking what allowed traffic should look like, decoy routing systems like Slitheen make traffic appear indistinguishable from allowed, uncensored traffic by design.
