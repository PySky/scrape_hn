I remember Alison as a first year student.  She came into my office with a friend.  “I’m a Bio-E major,” she told me.  “I don’t really know how to code, or build complex stuff, or design circuits.  Is anyone going to hire me for the summer?”  For the next three years, I watched Alison.  She took advantage of off-site conferences, hackathons and networking events.  She worked really hard in her classes, with her teams on projects and in preparation for her technical interviews.   And she asked for help when she needed it.  I was so proud of the young lady I saw walk across the stage at commencement.  Not just in terms of job offers, but also in the way she carried herself…in her confidence, and in her great big smile.  Alison no longer felt she was an Imposter at Olin.

When you don’t mind if you’re not smart,

When you don’t mind if you’re not smart, you set an example for others.

Alison finished up at Olin last December, and is currently a Software Engineer at Google in NYC.|||
