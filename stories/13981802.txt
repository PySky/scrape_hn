Domain names registered as Tesla and UAW getting ready for fight in a California.

A number of domain names were registered yesterday for an upcoming battle between automaker Tesla and United Auto Workers Union.

22 domain names referencing Tesla, unions and the UAW were registered at brand protection registrar MarkMonitor yesterday, including teslaunionfree.com, uawkillsjobs.com and unionizetesla.com. (A full list is below.)

The whois records for the domains use MarkMonitor’s domain name privacy service. Tesla uses MarkMonitor for its domain name registrations and UAW.org is at GoDaddy, so my bet is that Tesla is behind these registrations. Some of them are clearly designed to prevent UAW from using the domain names. I’m somewhat surprised UAW didn’t already own UAWsucks.com.

Add a fight against UAW to Tesla’s long list of challenges in the coming year as it tries to get the lower-priced Model 3 car out the door.|||
