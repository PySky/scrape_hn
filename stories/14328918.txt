Windows Template Studio is a Visual Studio 2017 Extension that accelerates the creation of new Univeral Windows Platform (UWP) apps using a wizard-based experience. The resulting UWP project is well-formed, readable code that incorporates the latest Windows 10 features while implementing proven patterns and best practices. Sprinkled throughout the generated code we have links Docs, Stack Overflow and blogs to provide useful insights.

Example scenario: I need an app that uses MVVM Light, uses master detail, can suspend and resume, settings, maps on one of the pages and will need Azure hub notifications. It will need a background service that does a query every 5 minutes.

Windows Template Studio approaches UWP app creation using the following four attribute sets:

Once you select the attributes you want your new UWP app to have, you can quickly extend the generated code.
