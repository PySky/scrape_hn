Welcome to mathmeth.com! We are a community dedicated to exploring the art of effective thinking. We conduct these explorations primarily through solving mathematical problems in the Calculational style. This style was developed by Edsger Dijkstra, Wim Feijen, Netty van Gasteren, and others.

You will find the work of our members on the Contributors page.

We have a mailing list where we discuss problems, the design of solutions, and generally stay in touch with each other. If you are new to our community, we highly encourage you to sign up and introduce yourself! You may do so using the form below:
