At the final meeting before spring recess, the Board of Supervisors approved in an 8-3 vote a resolution supporting Assemblymember Phil Ting’s efforts in Sacramento to pass a bill that would authorize San Francisco to ask voters to tax personal income. Currently, no city in California can.

The resolution was introduced by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who is working with Ting on the effort, and has said the tax could be The City’s best answer to address income inequality.

Board President London Breed, along with supervisors Jeff Sheehy and Mark Farrell, opposed it. Mayor Ed Lee previously told the San Francisco Examiner he didn’t support the tax.

San Francisco’s tech advocacy group, sf.citi, also did not support the tax. The advocate group was established by Ron Conway, the mayor’s most prominent backer and angel investor.

“Without proper evidence and research into these potential effects, implementing such a policy could be disastrous and greatly inhibit growth in our economy,” wrote sf.citi to the mayor and board prior to the vote. “sf.citi strongly urges the Board of Supervisors to delay any action on this resolution, and rather, to work with the Controller, Treasurer and Tax Collector’s offices on a review of the city’s tax policies and options for reform as we approach the November 2018 election.”

Mayor Lee has the option to veto, sign or return unsigned resolutions approved by the board. In this case, he returned it unsigned on March 31. Given the vote count, the board had the sufficient eight votes to overturn a potential mayoral veto.|||
