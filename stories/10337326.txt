Over the years AWS has grown to dozens of different services,  providing virtual machines,  databases, monitoring and  deployment tools on-demand. Today, it would be considered foolish to manage your own Postgres/MySQL server when you can set up an RDS instance with excellent scalability and availability characteristics in a matter of minutes.

Container infrastructure is starting to provide similar abstractions and benefits: One-click deployments, load balancing, auto-scaling, rolling deploys, recovery from failures, data migration, resource usage monitoring, and more. Increasingly, I see companies moving away from cloud provider services in favor of containers and container orchestration platforms. Core services like EC2 and S3 aren’t easily replaced, but others are, and there are good reasons to do so:

Just like Craigslist has been unbundled by purpose-built websites, it seems natural to (not only) me that cloud providers like AWS will be unbundled by purpose-built open source software. In a way that’s ironic because the value proposition of AWS is the exact opposite – bundling  open source software in a centralized place and giving them a consistent look and feel. Up until now we didn’t have the right technology to enable unbundling of PaaS solutions. It’s only recently that container infrastructure and orchestration are becoming mature enough to make this possible.|||
