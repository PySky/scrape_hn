This is a multithreaded JAVA Birthday-bound collision finder that will populate an AVL tree while querying for matches. once a match is found the two colliding files are output and then program increases the quality standard for nibble matches. Once the AVL tree is full new values are still generated and checked against the tree but not stored. The program is designed to run as long as necessary looking for collisions of increasing tail-end nibble matches.|||
