Rose Valley Falls is the best waterfall in Ojai and the biggest in Los Padres National Forest. I show you how to get to the upper tier of Rose Valley Falls, an epic 200' upper tier of the 300' total waterfall. I did a quick free climb next to the upper tier and the rocks are very loose. I don't recommend climbing them. This waterfall is like a bigger, badder brother on steroids compared to another popular two tiered waterfall in Southern California, Escondido Falls in Malibu.
