Here is my Katas for creating BASH programs that work. Nothing is new here, but from my experience pepole like to abuse BASH, forget computer science and create a Big ball of mud from their programs.

 Here I provide methods to defend your programs from braking, and keep the code tidy and clean.

All variable should be local.

As we see, this test does not concern main().

will print to the standard output:

What this code do?

Can be written much cleaner:

Good example where we clearly see the connection between lines and the connecting rods:

It should be a function:

echo is repeated in each line. For that we have Here Document:

Pay attention that there should be real tab ‘\t’ in the start of the line for each line.

 In vim you can use this replace command if your tab is 4 spaces:

Here is an example to complement the usage function above. I got this code from Kirk’s blog post - bash shell script to use getopts with gnu style long positional parameters:

You use it like this, using the immutable ARGS variable we defined at the top:

Here is another example using df command:

Here I have exception, for testing, I declare DF in the global scope not readonly. This is because of shunit2 not allowing to change global scope functions.|||
