If you take your fourth-generation iPad into Apple for a repair, the company may replace your tablet with a newer iPad Air 2 instead. According to an internal memo published by MacRumors, Apple started doing this on March 30, right around when the $329 iPad became available for purchase:

Starting March 30, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2 models. Apple's repair and order management tool will indicate for each repair if a substitution will take place. Please note the substitute part’s color and capacity to ensure the customer understands what their replacement iPad whole unit will be.

While you may get a new color and capacity, we also assume that customers with Smart Covers or other accessories for their fourth-generation iPads will need to buy new accessories for the iPad Air 2; we've contacted Apple for clarification and will update if we get a response.

The iPad Air 2 is two years newer than an iPad 4—it's significantly thinner, lighter, and faster, and it support iOS features like multitasking than the iPad 4 isn't capable of. More importantly, it's certain to be supported by the next major version of iOS, while the iPad 4 is more than likely to be dropped from the support list. Apple is likely running out of parts and replacement tablets for the older iPad, while the only-recently-discontinued iPad Air 2 is still available in abundance in Apple's refurbished store.

The iPad 4 was originally sold from November 2012 to October 2013, when it was replaced by the original iPad Air. It was then resurrected in March 2014 to replace the iPad 2 at the bottom of the lineup before being permanently discontinued in October 2014. The iPad Air 2 was sold from October 2014 until last month, when it was replaced by a new $329 iPad.|||

Your replacement tablet may be two years newer and faster than your old one.
