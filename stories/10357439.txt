Google's self-cars have been driving around on public roads since 2009. Before July 2015, only Mountain View and other Californian public roads. In July, they've arrived in Austin (TX). (Although no incident took place there, yet).

According to September 2015 data, there are 34 Google cars driving in Mountain View's public roads and 14 in Austin's. This brings the total to 48. That's 20 more than last month and the highest number of Google vehicles on public streets yet reported.|||
