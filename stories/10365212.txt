Not due to any particular fault of his own. To contrary belief, he was just a man. And man is inherently flawed.

Society has a habit of idealizing and idolizing people. Likely, because we want someone to point to and say, “that is the best of us”; “the best of what humans can be and do.” However, in that pursuit, we often forgot the flawed characteristics and history ends up immortalizing only the positive aspects of a person. It is done time and time again.

I can see the apprehension to why those closest around Jobs wanted the movie to be killed. For something being marketed as a biopic, Sorkin took many artistic liberties. There are unsavory and exaggerated parts of the movie that will inadvertently be what a generation of people come to believe as truth about Jobs. In hearing Jony Ives speak about Jobs, it is clear that he believes the only way to truly understand Jobs is to know him. There are nuances to the man that require deep and long context. These things can never be portrayed with a book or movie.

I was/am a ‘fanboy’ of Steve Jobs. Ascribe whatever connotation you would like to ‘fanboy’, but I admired Jobs greatly. What I take from Jobs, are his lessons and wisdom on life. His 2004 Stanford commencement speech is truly a source of advice for me in numerous points of my life and will continue to do as lessons learned during his life will become applicable to me as I grow older. My greatest regret will always be never seeing him give a MacWorld keynote (it was always during school and I never campaigned hard enough to skip it.) When he died, I felt guilty for feeling sad. I felt wrong to cry for somebody I didn’t know. It’s still a feeling that haunts me.|||
