I made a Wordpress plugin for the API. You just have to install the plugin and it works out of the box.

The plugin will check the emails when your visitors try to register or comment.

It uses the domain method, so only the domain is sent to the API.|||

Validator.pizza is made to prevent users to register to websites with a disposable email address. It checks in the same time if the domain or email is valid.
