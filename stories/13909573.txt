Programming languages are our interface to the myriad of computer systems we interact with on a daily basis. They allow us to craft complex sequences of operations at increasing high levels of abstraction. How are these languages designed? How are they implemented? How do we evaluate them?

The First International Programming Language Implementation Summer School (PLISS) will be held in Bertinoro, Italy from May 20 to 27, 2017. The Summer School's goal is to prepare early graduate students and advanced undergraduates for research in the field. This will be done through a combination of lectures on language implementation techniques and short talks exploring the state of the art in programming language research and practice.

Lectures cover current research and future trends in programming language design and implementation, including:

The instructors are accomplished researchers and practitioners with extensive experience designing and engineering successful languages and tools.|||
