Seth Godin has a recent post titled “What if scale wasn’t the goal?”.

I’ve posted the entirety of it below:

The knee jerk reaction in tech, as both VCs and, often, as founder is to agonize how scalable something is long before it has proven noteworthy.

A favorite reason for passing on an investment can be boiled down to “I don’t see how this can be a billion dollar business”.

I recently spoke with a founder who is working to answer the question at the heart of Seth’s post. Giacomo ‘Peldi’ Guilizzoni is the founder of the wireframing software company, Balsamiq. Our chat covered a wide range of topics, but it was his answers to my questions specific to scale that departed so completely from the VC funded startup narrative.

Peldi started Balsamiq nearly a decade ago. His intent was not be to it’s founder or CEO, but to be it’s only employee. Ever.

But if growth isn’t the goal then what is?

Unlike many founders who hit on something that’s working then rush to raise funding to scale, Balsamiq has chosen to take a more measured approach- consistently growing revenue and profits year of over year. Each year Peldi takes $1M out personally, socks away 18mo of runway for a rainy day, and pays out 15% of profits to Balsamiq’s 25 employees (this number grows by 2–3 new hires per year).

Over the years, there has been plenty of pressure to scale, be it from waves of competitors (Peldi called 2011 their year of the Clone Wars™) or VC’s looking to use the company’s massive user base as the foundation to roll up similar startups to dominate the category. To which Peldi says:

What hasn’t Balsamiq been able to do without the support and resources that come from taking on outside investors? Sell.

Back to Seth’s original question then. If scale isn’t the goal, then what is?|||
