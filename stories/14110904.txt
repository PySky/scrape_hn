This is a project to make a home "photo booth" using a Raspberry Pi. Anytime somebody on the Pi's network goes to a website, the Pi snaps a photo and displays it on the website.

The Pi uses Flask to run a simple Python web-server on the local network. Anytime another device on the network makes a GET request to the Pi's interanl IP address with the correct port, the Pi snaps a photo and serves it as a response. Additionally, the Pi saves all of the photos it takes.|||
