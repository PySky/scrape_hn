A quick google search returns several articles such as this one claiming that airlines make less than $10 in profit from each customer.

I feel there are a few reasons to doubt this premise:

You can connect through some destinations more cheaply than landing there

Skiplagged is a service helps users find cheaper airfare by booking flights that connect through their actual intended destinations to ones that are less popular and therefore are being sold more cheaply. Users are then expected to simply intentionally miss their final connection.

This means that a travel agency or airline can book seats on more planes and sell that connecting flight for less money. If the airlines have very small profit margins, then that proposition wouldn't just return less profit; it would lose money.

After 30 years of gradual decline due to competition, prices have been increasing since 2010 and have returned to levels they were at before the 'great recession'.

So, is the claim that airlines turn $10 profit per customer accurate?|||
