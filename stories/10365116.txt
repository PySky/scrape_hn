The Haskell community self-selects for people interested in unique things that Haskell can do that other languages cannot do. Consequently, a large chunk of Haskell example code in the wild uses advanced idioms (and I'm guilty of that, too).

So I would like to swing the pendulum in the other direction by just writing five small but useful programs without any imports, language extensions, or advanced features. These are programs that you could write in any other language and that's the point: you can use Haskell in the same way that you use other languages.

They won't be the prettiest or most type-safe programs, but that's okay.

This program is an interactive TODO list:

The following program transforms tab-separated standard input into comma-separated standard output. The program does not handle more complex cases like quoting and is not standards-compliant:

This program converts an RNA sequence read from standard input into the equivalent sequence of amino acids written to standard output, using the genetic code:

If you would like to contribute a simple example of your own, try sharing a paste of your program under the #Haskell #BackToBasics hashtags.|||
