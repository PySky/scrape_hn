Foreword: This was built for a talk in RubyConf Brasil 2015, no changes will be made I guess.

Displays the engine vibration levels as provided by a 0->10 sensor. Sensor must be calibrated.

This program can be used with other sensors like: Speedometer, accelerometer and so forth. I personally tested it with a pitot system and it worked perfectly with sensors calibrated to work with Lyncoming O235 engines.

It can run in a RTOS, read rtos.c to know how you can hook this gem into your specific RTOS. You might need to get rid of Rubygems depending on the OS you are planning to run this code.

This gem was tested in OSX, PREEMPT_RT, Xenomai Linux and a proprietary OS it works as intended.

Warning: While you may use this inside an aircraft for testing purposes I advise you not to unless you are an experienced instructor or test pilot or passenger.
