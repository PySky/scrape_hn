In absence of a centralized log collection tool and the ability to see them all side by side, correlation would not be possible. Most logs are helpful in ascertaining security threats but they are useless in isolation without any connection established with other logs. For example, there is a log which says “Unauthorized Access detected” and shows the time when this event occurred. Unless it is established if this was internal or external breach and what led to such a breach, the extent of damage cannot be ascertained. For such instances, we need the event correlation and need to see logs from different sources. This can be done by human intervention or a logical analysis through event correlation rules. Event correlation helps in detection of the incident and follow the trail so that security analysts and incident responders can know the nature and extent of the damage occurred through such a breach and get to the right direction of investigation to be prepared in responding to such situation.|||
