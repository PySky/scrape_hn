The executive who oversees Microsoft’s developer tools and services, S. Somasegar, has announced that he will leave the company after 27 years. In a series of tweets, Somasegar, who is usually called by his nickname Soma, said he plans to pursue other career opportunities.

ZDNet first broke news of Somasegar’s departure after obtaining an internal memo. In it, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive vice president Scott Guthrie said Microsoft hopes to announce a transition plan in the next few weeks. A Microsoft spokesman told TechCrunch the company currently has no comment.

Somasegar is a familiar name to Microsoft followers because, as the corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Developer Division, he was in charge of engineering and marketing developer tools and services, including Visual Studio, Team Foundation, and programming languages. After joining Microsoft in 1989, Somasegar contributed to eight Windows releases before joining the Developer Division.

He also oversaw Microsoft-owned sites like MSDN, a community for developers, and news portal TechNet.|||
