Police are reviewing the round-the-clock guard outside the Ecuadorian embassy preventing the escape of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange amid concerns that it is putting a strain on resources, the Metropolitan police commissioner has said.

The cost of the operation, which began in June 2012, has reached about £10m, according to figures published last week.

The Met commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, told LBC radio on Tuesday: “We won’t talk about tactics, but we are reviewing what options we have. It is sucking our resources.”

Assange walked into the embassy on 19 June, 2012, in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sex assault and rape accusations, which he denies.

He has said he fears he will be extradited to the US to face charges relating to WikiLeaks’ publishing activities.

In August 2013, Ecuador granted him political asylum but the police are stationed outside the South Kensington building to arrest him if he leaves the building.



Figures obtained by LBC under the Freedom of Information Act showed that the Met spent £9m on policing the building to the end of October last year.

In August last year, Assange said he would leave the embassy “soon” amid reports that he was planning to hand himself in to police but there has been no sign of an end to the impasse since.

In November, Stockholm’s appeal court rejected a demand by Assange’s lawyers to lift the arrest warrant against him.



The Foreign Office has maintained that it is committed to a diplomatic solution to the standoff but talks between UK and Ecuadorian officials have failed to bear fruit.|||
