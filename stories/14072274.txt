Shuttleworth: Growing Ubuntu for Cloud and IoT, rather than Phone and convergence

The choice, ultimately, is to invest in the areas which are contributing to the growth of the company. Those are Ubuntu itself, for desktops, servers and VMs, our cloud infrastructure products (OpenStack and Kubernetes) our cloud operations capabilities (MAAS, LXD, Juju, BootStack), and our IoT story in snaps and Ubuntu Core. All of those have communities, customers, revenue and growth, the ingredients for a great and independent company, with scale and momentum. This is the time for us to ensure, across the board, that we have the fitness and rigour for that path.

Mark Shuttleworth reports that Canonical is ending its investment in Unity8, the phone and convergence shell. GNOME will be the default desktop for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. "" (Thanks to Unnikrishnan Alathady Maloor) Log in to post comments)|||
