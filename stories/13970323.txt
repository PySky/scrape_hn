Based on my own experience with Should I Sign and prior endeavors, I would suggest the following approach:

Now, getting more into the particulars, here are the key roles that are likely to be crucial to any startup.

Outside of core team members, there may be a variety of things a young business needs that may not warrant full time involvement. These needs can vary from business to business. The best way to fill these needs is to leverage advisors and service providers. Advisors can be useful when it comes to fundraising, developing partnerships, business strategy, marketing strategy and even product strategy.

Service providers that are crucial to any business are accountants and lawyers. There are plenty of accountants and bookkeeping services that specialize in servicing younger companies and are relatively affordable. When it comes to lawyers, the spectrum is wider and even murkier. Most startups and small businesses will need a variety of lawyers throughout their business life cycle. At Should I Sign, we built a fully-vetted network of business, employment and IP attorneys who can help with the transactional legal needs that arise along the way from formation to exit. All of our attorneys provide fixed-fee quotes for your exact legal need on a project basis with without hourly billing surprises.|||
