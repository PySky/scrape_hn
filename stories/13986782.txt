We asked HR practitioners and leaders involved with diversity and inclusion (D&I) in over 150 organizations about their current programs to shed light on what is working and what is not. In fact, researchers recently found that mandatory diversity training that tries to police thoughts and behaviors do more harm than good.

In our survey, we asked about the D&I training offered but also explored the outcomes of those engagements to better understand the most effective ways to build inclusive diversity.
