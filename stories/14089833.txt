When I started writing on medium. I hardly got 100 views. But I kept writing. One fine day David Smooke noticed my posts. He added me as a writer in Hackernoon. Thank you David, otherwise I would have still been struggling.

When I got lucky it hit five thousand views.

This was good comparing to the time when I started. However, if you notice the recommends I got were very less.

Then I decided to write stories about what I personally experienced. My life didn’t have great adventures. So I decided to start one. I decide to build a start-up while I write about it. My first post in the series Building a start-up from scratch Pt 1 : Identifying the problem received 99 recommends. This was way high compared to my previous posts.

That is the story behind the post How India saved its internet from greedy corporations.

I submitted a raw post. My writing skills were not great. The editors of FreeCodeCamp polished it. They share the credit. This is why the title of this post is “How we made it to popular on medium list”.

In four days it received 570 recommends. Yes, it also made it to popular on medium list.

My point is it’s difficult to make it alone. You can take a smartcut by working with others.

Lookout for the leaders and see what they work for. Think of ways you can add value. Collaborate and they will help you climb the ladder.|||
