NGINX is a multi-faceted tool, and if you’re just getting your feet wet--or need a buffer--you’ll want to check this presentation out first. One popular use for NGINX is as a HTTPS reverse proxy--enabling services to support encrypted protocols that don’t normally do so. Why should you be an expert on this? Putting NGINX in front of HTTP-based websites and services allows them to be fully HTTPS compliant, taking advantage of NGINX’s state-of-the-art encryption technology. 

 

This session will start by introducing the basics of HTTPS and web encryption. Attendees will learn how to get a proper HTTPS certificate from a certificate authority (“CA”) for browser-facing services, and an internal CA for internal services. The session will also cover the ngx_http_ssl_module, and what it takes to configure it to the industry standard. This is your spark notes session for getting that A+ in security.|||
