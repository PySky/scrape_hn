Apple may have left another clue that its self-driving car project is still alive.

In February, the tech giant published a list of suppliers it is working with, including Robert Bosch. Apple lists Bosch’s office in Reutlingen, Germany, which houses the supplier's automotive electronics division.

A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the relationship. A Bosch spokesman confirmed the company was working with Apple as a supplier, but declined to comment on the specifics of the relationship.

To be sure, Bosch’s Reutlingen office also handles non-automotive electronics, such as sensors for consumer electronics devices, according to the company’s website. However, many of the products developed in the division are automotive-related, including components for vehicle sensors and electronic control units, which power braking, steering and other vehicle systems.

Apple’s relationship with Bosch follows the company’s public comment on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s autonomous vehicle guidelines.

“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” the comment states.

The comment, authored by Steve Kenner, who left his position as director of Ford Motor Co.’s automotive safety office two years ago to head Apple’s product integrity unit, rekindled speculation over Apple’s automotive aspirations after the company reportedly laid off many of the engineers working on its car project.|||
