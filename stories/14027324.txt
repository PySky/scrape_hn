Our recent attempts to compute AI, or rather AGI (artificial general Intelligence) are not new. They can be traced back quite some time.

How far back depends on whom you ask, for the purpose of this write–up I will focus on Minsky, McCarthy and MIT’s AI Lab as the starting point (but we could easily go back to Turing and beyond).

When Minsky and McCarthy started the lab in 1959 they were very much set on computing general intelligence. Machines that think, armed with consciousness and able at learning.

They sought to achieve that by a number of means. Of varying techniques, but a shared point of view.

In an interview to Jeffery Mishlove (of Thinking Allowed), John McCarthy confessed to:

To annotate: “looking at it from the point of view of biology…” means the kind of “wet” programming the brain does, neurons, axons and so forth. Simulating such process is likely to be a reference to neural networks, which are (broadly speaking) sets of networks modeled around the way the brain works: namely taking a stab at clustering logic in proximity and generating hierarchies of information.

“Looking at it from the point of psychology” is equally as provoking, as it refers to human intelligence as buckets of knowledge.

To push that slightly further before annotating, here is a quote by Marvin Minsky, part of a monologue in Machine Dreams.

This is the other way of computing a brain. Buckets of knowledge, and sets of actions, compartmentalized in different vertical buckets. Switched by emotions.

Beyond being offensive to humanities, this argument is also easy to debunk using a quick thought experiment.|||
