How long does this book take to complete? You should take as long as you need with each module to fully grasp the material. It's not a race, and the only deadlines are the ones you set for yourself. Assuming you already have some programming experience and can do at least one module a day, you should expect to spend at least three months. What kind of computer do I need? Common Lisp is available for nearly every platform. Your personal computer, whether it be a Mac, Windows, or Linux platform, will be fine. For all the features of this website, however, you may need to update your browser to the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.|||
