This is an unofficial guide to GCC’s internals, aimed at new developers, and at plugin authors.

I’m a relative newcomer to GCC, so I thought it was worth documenting some of the hurdles I ran into when I started working on GCC, to try to make it easier for others to start hacking on GCC. Hence this guide.|||
