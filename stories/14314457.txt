An annotated digest of the top "Hacker" "News" posts for the first week of May, 2017.

Getting Started with Headless Chrome

 (comments)

 Google enables webshits to remove the 'browsing' part of their web browser. Hackernews trades python programs about it. One Hackernews is inspired to run his browser several times with a filesystem and a network interface for each copy, but dismisses virtual machines as "too heavy." Everyone else just wants to take screenshots without the 'screen' part.

CRISPR eliminates HIV-1 infection in live animals

 (comments)

 Some biologists use a gene editing tool to edit genes. Hackernews trades youtube videos and NPR stories so they can more effectively pretend to understand anything. One Hackernews has a friend who totally fixed everything and just needs venture capital. The rest of the comments are people misquoting the NPR stories in an attempt to sound educated.

Root – Programmable bank account for software developers

 (comments)

 A foreign bank wants you to rub javascript on your money. Their example code involves transaction approval in a Slack message. Hackernews, the place where crypto code is too hard for mortals to write and the Rust Evangelism Strike Force has indoctrinated a deep-seated fear of pointers, thinks applying javascript directly to money is a fantastic idea. Most of the comments are people misinforming each other about banking law, international fiduciary policy, and needlessly in-depth descriptions of the retarded things Hackernews does to feel in control of their money.

Uber faces criminal probe over software used to evade authorities

 (comments)

 A jitney cab outfit is in dutch with the fuzz. Hackernews divides into two groups: people who are slightly upset at how brazenly Uber is willing to shit on the law, and people who are firmly convinced that no laws are valid if such laws prevent money from changing hands. Most of the people on the latter side are the same idiots who insist that Uber is "ride-sharing" and not just a shitty taxi company. Countless thousands of words are wasted arguing about whether Uber is demonstrating "civil disobedience" or "criminal conspiracy."

The Horror in the Standard Library

 (comments)

 Some internets realize their overbuilt C++ shitware is falling over. They are forced to delve into the guts of a terrible programming language to fix it. Hackernews trades battle stories about their shitty code, the bad choices of libraries they made when writing their shitty code, the ridiculous programming languages they selected to implement everything, and the trash hardware they bought to run it all. The rest of the thread is bikeshedding the blog post.

Why does Google prepend while(1); to their JSON responses?

 (comments)

 An internet links to a stackoverflow discussion about yet another javascript workaround. Hackernews is blown away by the complexity of modern webshit and adamant that it is impossible to live without writing javascript. Bizarrely, half the comments are about how important backwards compatibility is to the web, completely ignoring the fact that no browser more than a few years old is capable of rendering most of the arcane garbage involved in current webshit.

Wikimedia Foundation spending

 (comments)

 An internet whines about Wikipedia's checkbook. Hackernews swoops in to jerk off about Warren Buffet quotes, profound thoughts about leadership in technology, and pointless speculation about Wikipedia's management policies. Nobody performs a cost-benefit analysis of just eradicating Wikipedia altogether. Some of the more useless Hackernews gather at the bottom of the page to bikeshed the article's title.

The Guardian Pulls Out of Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News

 (comments)

 A newspaper stops paying for retarded comments on its articles. Hackernews has strong opinions about monopolies, decentralization, paying for journalism, and their complete inability to survive without Facebook. Mostly they're trying to decide if they hate the newspaper because it is full of nazis, or if they hate the newspaper because it is mean to nazis.

Lyrebird – An API to copy the voice of anyone

 (comments)

 Some internets teach their DECTalk to poorly impersonate politicians. Hackernews is no longer sure what is real: they're worried that history is unreliable, the future is terrifyingly confusing, the company might have faked their samples, and next week we will lose track of what a human being is. You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

Robert M. Pirsig has died

 (comments)

 A professional lunatic passes away. Hackernews misunderstands basic economics for a few hours, moves on to misunderstanding religion for a while, expands to misunderstanding philosophy, then settles in to bitch about how useless school is.

Painting with Code: Introducing our new open source library React Sketch.app

 (comments)

 Some webshits make new webshit. It's basically "Rapid Application Development" from the 90s, except without the rapidity and resulting in no application. Hackernews is over the moon with joy. Presumably AirBnB, whose business model is "Uber for toilets," created this to stress-test potential toilets before entering into business partnerships with them.

Postal: Open source mail delivery platform, alternative to Mailgun or Sendgrid

 (comments)

 Some assholes write a mail transport agent -- not a mail delivery agent -- and because webshits are incapable of doing otherwise, they write it in Ruby on Rails. It has over thirty direct dependencies in Ruby, only a handful of which are version pinned. One of them is 'mail', raising the question of what the hell the other thirty are for. Hackernews spends a couple days cargo-culting about how hard it is to run an email server. One Hackernews says he successfully runs an email server; everyone tells him how easy that is and also that he's probably doing it wrong.

Rust 1.17

 (comments)

 Christ Jesus of Nazareth, Light of the World, Lamb of God, Son of Man descends bodily from heaven and delivers unto our undeserving civilization the Blessing of a new version of the Truth. This one contains minor syntax updates. An unsuspecting Hackernews blasphemes by asking what the point of Rust is. The Rust Evangelism Strike Force ensures the resulting thread is exclusively comprised of shitting on other languages. Never forget: Rust isn't the best because it's good; it's the best because using anything else is morally equivalent to genocide. One Hackernews tries to build code that built last year. One guess whether it works.

The Boring Company [video]

 (comments)

 Frustrated with not being taken seriously as a Bond villain, Elon Musk sets about literally undermining civilization. Hackernews declares all skeptics to be heretics and fools who will be the first against the wall when the Muskolution comes. Hackernews is resolute on two facts: Elon Musk is smarter than every other living creature, and all successes at any Musk-related companies are his personal doing, which have nothing to do with the billions of dollars he spends hiring the brightest scientists and engineers on earth. There is only Elon (peace be unto him).

Show HN: Sorting Two Metric Tons of Lego

 (comments)

 An internet overthinks sorting his toys. Hackernews bikesheds both the machine-learning crap that does all the work and the actual physical hardware involved in the project. Eight hundred people tell the creator to start a doomed business sorting toys.

Why Use Postgres?

 (comments)

 An internet wants you to use some database software. Hackernews is excited at the possibility of pushing more computation out of their programs and into an overbuilt database management system. The rest of the comments are partisan bickering between people who like support contracts and people who ascribe morality to copyright licenses. An idiot wants to know how PostgreSQL compares to MongoDB, and nobody comes right out and says "one is a database and the other is incompetent webshit garbage."

Disclaimer

 Nobody mentioned Rust this week. FEMA advises all internet forums to remain calm and seek shelter if municipal typecheckers fail.

Golang SSH Security

 (comments)

 An internet notices that a library bypasses security measures, then notifies a company and the library's vendor. The company explicitly states they do not give a shit about security measures because they are hard and everything will probably be fine. The vendors of the library, Google, respond by instructing the reporter to bypass other security measures*. Both organizations defend their bullshit on Hackernews. Hackernews accepts the bullshit.

How to Raise a Creative Child – Step One: Back Off (2016)

 (comments)

 An internet writes sixteen thousand words without meaningfully expanding on the headline. Hackernews believes that mediocrity is preferable. In addition, all of the problems their kids have, as well as all of the problems they had when they were kids, are your fault. Some Hackernews debate whether it's even worth the effort of being good at something, since AI and robots will take all the jobs next week.

Steve Ballmer serves up a data trove about government spending in the US

 (comments)

 A rich guy makes a webshit about money. Hackernews lists similar webshits about money, then launches into the usual posting-flood of misunderstanding tax law, governance-from-first-principles, and bad economic theory.

USA Facts – Federal, state, and local data from government sources

 (comments)

 This is the webshit from the previous day's rich guy, because Hackernews wasn't done misunderstanding everything. Now that they've got some hard data to ignore, they have another shitfest of lies, confusion, and using the word "generally" to mean "in the cases I have noticed." One Hackernews wonders what the big deal is with the Constitution. Someone shows up to compare it to software.

Google plans ad-blocking feature in Chrome browser

 (comments)

 Google, an advertising agency, sets about blocking content from competing advertising agencies. Some Hackernews think that maybe Google's motives are a little selfish here, but by and large Hackernews is incapable of thinking negative thoughts about Google. Other Hackernews suggest using software that Google didn't make, such as software that Apple made. The end result: everyone agrees it's going to be great.

Calculus Made Easy (1914) [pdf]

 (comments)

 A Hackernews posts a link to a scanned copy of a math book. Hackernews compiles the usual list of not-particularly-relevant "see also" URLs. One Hackernews points out that there's a very nicely prepared copy of the book available, both in source code and typeset forms, but that is derided. The scanned copy of course has brighter highs and a better soundstage in the mids, without confusing or dry bass timbres or ruining the pace, rhythm, and timing of the original master. The rest of the comments are people demanding to know why nobody showed them this specific book before someone showed them this specific book, and ignoring any answers to such a stupid question.

What Happens When You Send a Zero-Day to a Bank?

 (comments)

 An internet posts about bank security to his blog. Hackernews demands an ombudsman to handle computer security problem reports, suggests several organizations that exist for exactly this purpose, and determines that they're all doing it wrong. Several Hackernews come forward to report they entrust similarly incompetent banks with their money, but everyone is too cowardly to name any. The rest of the comments are people speculating about contract law.



 * - Imagine that. Vendor-related problems with Go. For a change, this one couldn't have been trivially solved with plain old package management.|||
