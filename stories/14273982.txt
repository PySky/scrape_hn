The factors I've listed (integration, complexity and closed-source) are necessary in the world we're living in, with all the advances in engineering, competition between companies, as well as laws in different countries.

We can, and this is the reason ZeroPhone project was born. Nowadays, we can assemble a phone from easily available parts, using available SBCs that run Linux, and we'll be able to adjust it to our needs - unlike with modern phones, when we have to adjust ourselves to suit the workflow the phone offers. With ZeroPhone, hackers can finally have smartphones that are going to work for them, not against them, people with special needs will be able to have to have custom-tailored phones, and people that want to protect their privacy will have a phone that respects it.

Our technical challenges are: developing PCBs that'd be feature-packed, but with components that'd be easy to source and solder, as well as developing mobile phone software that'd be open, high-quality and highly modifiable to suit any needs people might have. However, much bigger challenges are - building a community of people experimenting with ZeroPhone platform, keeping ZeroPhone open-source and independent of any harmful influences, and experimenting with new ways of intergrating smartphones in our lives without selling our lives in the process.
