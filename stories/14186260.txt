How many times have you said (or heard someone else say) – that you couldn’t buy the whatever-you-want until payday?

There is an epidemic of people living paycheck to paycheck. Well, I’m using the term “living” sort of loosely here. (People NEED to stop living paycheck to paycheck,because it’s not living – it’s more like surviving.) Are you one of these people?

The good news is that if you ARE one of these people, you can stop. It just takes a little effort.

JUST GET STARTED

 I won’t insult your intelligence by saying that it’s “easy” to stop living paycheck to paycheck, or that it won’t take you long, or that you won’t struggle with the adjustments. But gaining financial freedom IS possible, and you don’t have to have a 6 figure salary to do it. (I can say this, because we live “financially free”, and last year we didn’t make $50,000. We can’t buy whatever we want whenever we want, but we never have to “wait for payday” to make a purchase.)

Getting started is the hardest part. As your good habits gain momentum and you start to SEE results, you’ll be more motivated than ever… and it will get easier.

Are you ready to stop living paycheck to paycheck? I’d love to hear your plans and encourage you if I can!|||
