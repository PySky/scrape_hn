And of the book The Elements of Computing Systems, MIT Press, By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken

The site contains all the software tools and project materials necessary to build a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. We also provide a set of lectures designed to support a typical course on the subject.

The materials are aimed at students, instructors, and self-learners. Everything is free and open-source; as long as you operate in a non-profit educational setting, you are welcome to modify and use our materials as you see fit.

The materials also support two courses that we now teach in Coursera:

Nand2Tetris Part I (hardware, projects/chapters 1-6) is offered as an on-demand course that learners take at their own pace. Here is a two-minute video promo of this course.

Nand2Tetris Part II (software, projects/chapters 7-12): is also offered on Coursera, in the same format.|||
