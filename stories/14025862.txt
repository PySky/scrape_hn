Hundreds of medical students at the University of Glasgow are going to have to resit one of their examinations after evidence of collusion was uncovered. A clinical examination they sat this year had been declared void amid suspicions that some students used social media to share information.

It’s not the first time technology has been linked to cheating. Research by the Student Room, an online community for students aged between 14 and 24, in 2015 found 11% cheated in breaking the rules in their GCSEs, A-levels and degree finals. While many stuck to smuggling in notes, some students also started developing hi-tech methods to try to improve their grades. These include using concealed headphones linked to gadgets with recorded information, and holding information on calculators.

Last year a university in Thailand caught a group of students using smart watches and cameras concealed in glasses to cheat during entrance exams, forcing the cancellation of the tests for others.

We want to hear from students and lecturers about this subject. Does your university have a policy in place to ensure students don’t use technological devices? Are smartwatches banned in exam halls, for example? Have you heard of young people getting hold of different devices? How common is cheating? Hast it changed?
