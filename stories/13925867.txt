Tomorrow we’ll be launching an early version of a new profile page experience with a few redditors. These testers will have a new profile page design, the ability to make posts directly to their profile (not just to communities), and logged-in redditors will be able to follow them. We think this product will be helpful to the Reddit community and want to give you a heads up.

We’re making this change because content creators tell us they have a hard time finding the right place to post their content. We also want to support them in being able to grow their own followers (similar to how communities can build subscribers). We’ve been working very closely with mods in a few communities to make sure the product will not negatively impact our existing communities. These mods have provided incredibly helpful feedback during the development process, and we are very grateful to them. They are the ones that helped us select the first batch of test users.

We don’t think there will be any direct impact to how you moderate your communities or changes to your day-to-day activities with this version of the launch. We expect the carefully selected, small group of redditors to continue to follow all of the rules of your communities.

I’ll be here for a while to answer any questions you may have.|||
