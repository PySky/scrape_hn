I regularly read articles on Long-term investments on Seeking Alpha and I wanted to do a sort of trend analysis on recent stocks. The ultimate goal is to build a sentiment analysis engine of sorts based on various data sources.

For the moment, I decided to generate a graph that lists all ticker mentions in the past 30 days. A fatter circle implies a greater frequency for that day. To eliminate spam and keep it interesting, tickers with a total reference count of 2 or below have been filtered out.

Disclaimer: please use this data at your own risk - SA articles usually have positive and negative indicators so it's possible that a stock is highlighted due to a very high negative sentiment. In the next iteration I hope to have postive/negative direction baked in.

Here is where we will say something.

The ticker with the highest reference count within the past 30 days is:|||
