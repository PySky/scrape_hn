This repository contains a Java 8 implementation of a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Distribution Point and an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Responder.

This app is a Dropwizard app that can respond to CRL requests and OCSP requests for a given CA. You need to provide the app with access to the index file of the CA, which is effectively the database for the CA, the crl file, and a Java KeyStore containing the key and certificate chain to sign the OCSP responses with. This is all done within the file.

To test the application, run the following commands.|||
