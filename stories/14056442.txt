We are looking for an expert with experience using APIs to get data and create an extract in csv. Ideally the expert knows Marketo and their API (http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/).

The file is like this

The use-case is to automate the collection of this data so it is not manual.  Basically SELECT list_size FROM marketo_smartlist_name.  This needs to be done 50 times.

So I want a script that can use the Marketo API to get this data as pseudo-queried above and dump the output to CSV when it is run.  Ideally the output will be 50 column headers (one for each list) and one number under each heading (again one number of each list).  Again the column name is the SmartList name and the metric is the count of users on the list. Like this: https://screencast.com/t/5obb9gLAL

Make the same call using Marketo API for the same data but change the name of the list. Iterate this 50 times for 50 different lists, and then dump a CSV with the name of lists as the column head and the count of items in the list as the value below.  Does this make sense to you?  It really is that simple. It's one query for one datum reused 50 times changing the name of the list to get the data.

Please provide your experience with Marketo, REST APIs and this type of project.|||
