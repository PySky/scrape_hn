What are you looking to solve? What ideas do you already have? What ideas do you want to validate? Is there a realistic basic version you could build to test your hypothesis?

I have a continuous list of ideas. Some are batshit crazy, some are feasible, some are fairly ‘boring’, some are “Uber/Tinder for X”. I write them all down; the ‘X for Y’ ones are usually just an easy first step to visualise what you are thinking.

Is your idea a big one? Think about where you can focus initially. What can you build to prove your assumptions in solving this problem.

Remember these don’t have to be life-changing. This is merely a way to get into the practice of actually launching something, and quickly.

When you can churn out products quickly and often, you realize that it’s less of a big deal than you thought. You get less attached and likely to have an open mind to feedback, changing the focus or accepting it turned out shit.

I’ve experienced all the above situations.

You’ve got an idea with a focus. Cool 👍. Now map out how you are going to launch it. What tools you could use to get a feasible launch out the door. All ideas can be simplified into a build-able product quickly.

It may be that you have to do things manually, it may look ugly as hell but it just needs to do the function you want it to.

No one likes that person. I’ve been that person.

Who in your network could you bounce this idea off of? Who has valuable insights? (They don’t have to necessarily be the target audience). What do they focus on that you haven’t thought of? What do they love/hate about it?

Oh no! They don’t like some of your ideas. Guess what? You’ve not made anything yet so don’t sweat it. Perhaps you feel strongly against their opinion. Or perhaps if after a handful of people say the same thing, you rethink it.

This whole process is testing, is not costing you money and is a learning experience. It’s an experiment, always remember that.

I message about 5–15 people (probably weekly, some, daily) who I’m friends with via my startup-network and trust with my ideas, however wacky. They will tell me what they really think. Although when you know someone well enough, “yeah cool, it’s a nice idea” = “this is shit, NEXT.”

Also chatting with others helps you find out about other companies who may already be toe-deep in this space. Maybe you knew about them, maybe you didn’t. Either way, its a good thing to be discussing, why you are looking at it differently.

Use whatever you feel most comfortable with. Paper? Whiteboard? Napkin? Design/prototyping tools? All will do.

Draw some ways you envision this to look. Do a few variations but make sure you are drawing up some completely different ones too. Look at other websites to get some inspiration. There are a ton of ‘website design directories’. Is there a website you visited that you thought the experience was really interesting?

Check out Product Pages if you want somewhere to start.

I often do the ‘mockup’ when I’m actually making it. It may make me slower but using things like Carrd (mentioned below) lets me change things so quickly and easily.

Time to learn to accept what actually will look good, what you can actually make with the tools you have, what a good flow looks like, what is too complicated.

Focus on the one action you want your users to do. If it’s to sign up for something or click a certain button then make it easy for users to do so. Make things clear and simple.

Sometimes I’ll revisit my ‘feedback friends’ to check it out and if something isn’t clear or needs new colours (I’m bad at that!) then they will let me know and I’ll tweak it.

For me, I already have my go-to tools for this process (see below). No doubt there will be new ones that come to my attention, especially given my role at Product Hunt. I’m always testing out new things.

It may take you some research before, after, or even during this process. Don’t worry about testing things out, not liking them and going for alternatives. I’ve found the more simple, the better for me. I’ve tested different web builders, like WebFlow, and I got a site up and running but it’s more complex than I usually need. However I have a designer friend who swears by it and uses nothing else.

There’s often no one-size-fits-all too so be open to trying different things.

This step looks different for everyone, me included.

Sometimes hunting it on Product Hunt and seeing if anyone likes it (or cares) is my launch. Or I may post it out to Twitter to get some feedback. Other times just posting it to a wider group of friends is the launch.

The point is that it is live and it works (perhaps ugly). You’ve made something. It’s launched 🚀

People want to do this process for a number of reasons. Mine are usually for learning experiences. I’m curious and like exploring new tech groups and how I can build something to support that.

Again, this looks different for everyone.

I have many projects of varying success. All are still live. One has spun off and become a company (I’m no longer involved), one still gets thousands of pageviews and users a month, some spike when launching and then drop off.

I don’t have time to try and make all these experiments into anything more and I’m ok with that. I’m not looking to launch companies, I’m just looking to launch.

Also I have a little graveyard of products I’ve made and are ready to launch but I just decided against it or thought it wasn’t as good as first thought. These don’t take up much time and are just experiments so I have no emotional attachments. It happens.|||

I can’t write a single line of code and I’ve launched 10+ products within the last two years. All of them have been experimental side projects and some have done pretty well. I don’t have a ‘perfect…
