A simple script to create and launch your Counter-Strike : Global Offensive Dedicated Server.

 Tested on Debian based distros (Ubuntu, Mint, ...)

Of course a Steam account is required to create a Counter-Strike : Global Offensive dedicated server.

Execute the following commands to download the script :

Before running the script, you must change some vars in the config file .

 If you change the location of the config file, do not forget to change the path in the csgo-server-launcher script file for the CONFIG_FILE var (default ).

The screen name, you can put what you want but it must be unique and must contain only alphanumeric character.

 Example:

Name of the linux user who started the server.

 Example:

The port that your server should listen on.

 Example:

Anonymous connection will be deprecated in the near future. Therefore it is highly recommended to generate a Game Server Login Token. More info : http://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers

 Example:

Name of the script that steamcmd should execute for autoupdate. This file is created on the fly, you don't normally need to change this variable.

 Example:

Root directory for the server.

 Example:

Path to the game.

 Example:

You don't normally need to change this variable.

 Example:

Mail address where the update's logs are sent. Leave empty to disable sending mail.

 Example:

Number of retries in case of failure of the update.

 Example:

To download maps from the workshop, your server needs access to the steam web api. Leave empty if the file exists. Otherwise, to allow this you'll need an authorization key which you can generate : http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

 Example:

A collection id from the Maps Workshop. The API_AUTHORIZATION_KEY is required. More info : https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CSGO_Workshop_For_Server_Operators

 Example:

A map id in the selected collection (WORKSHOP_COLLECTION_ID). The API_AUTHORIZATION_KEY is required.

 Example:

Maximum players that can connect.

 Example:

The tickrate that your server will operate at.

 Example:

For the console mod, press CTRL+A then D to stop the screen without stopping the server.

You can automatically update your game server by calling the script in a crontab. Just add this line in your crontab and change the folder if necessary.

This will update your server every day at 4 am.
