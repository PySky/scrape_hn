We already know that the OnePlus 5 could be one of the best smartphones released in 2017 and a recent GeekBench result basically confirms this, as the handset scored an impressive 1963, in single-core mode, and 6687 in multi-core, surpassing models like the Samsung Galaxy S8 or Sony Xperia XZ Premium.

Currently, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and the Xperia XZ Premium are two of the most popular handset, relying on the same chipset, the Snapdragon 835. However, their scores are lower – with just a bit, though – than the OnePlus 5‘s.

To be more specific, Samsung Galaxy S8 scored 1929 points in single-core and 6084 in multi-core, while Sony’s top notch model got 1943 in single core and 5824 in multi-core.

The leaked screenshot from the GeekBench result also reveals a couple of features about OnePlus 5. We’re talking about the operating system, which will be the manufacturer’s own OxygenOS, but with Android 7.1.1 Nougat as a base.

Finally, it’s worth mentioning that this leaked screenshot shouldn’t be taken as granted, so there’s a chance that all these numbers can be fake, as well as the software the smartphone is running.

On the other side, we could be looking at the results of a pre-production unit, known for having slightly different scores, compared to the final, consumer variants of the handset. However, considering that the numbers are pretty much in line with the scores of other Snapdragon 835-powered devices, there’s a chance for these to be pretty accurate.

Keep an eye on our site, as we will be back with more details about the OnePlus 5, as soon as anything new comes up.|||
