Materials on the H-1B work visa issue, the computer industry's claims of a desperate software labor shortage, etc.:|||

There is no software labor shortage.  Instead, there
is rampant age discrimination in the high tech industry.
Employers will hire someone over 40 only if he/she is lucky enough to 
have currently hot software skills; instead, employers focus on 
hiring new college graduates and foreign nationals, both of
which are cheaper than domestic mid-career programmers.
