How far can Zipline fly?

A Zipline Distribution Center can reliably deliver to any site within 75 km (150 km round trip), even with high winds, downpours, and tall mountains.

What infrastructure is needed at the delivery site?

Nothing. Zipline does not land or recharge at delivery sites, so no infrastructure needs to be installed. To begin service to a new delivery site, Zipline performs a survey flight to map the area. Within two days, we're ready to start delivering to an open clearing the size of two parking spaces. This can even be on the clinic's roof!

No. Zipline provides a fully-integrated delivery service. We operate our own equipment so you don't have to worry about the ins-and-outs.

Yes. Zipline has engineered the airplanes from the ground up with safety as the top priority. Redundant motors, batteries, GPS, and electronics are why Zipline's airplanes are among the safest in the sky. Additionally, each Zipline airplane has a parachute landing system.

Why does a Zipline drone look more like an airplane than a quadcopter?

Zipline has designed its service to meet the real-world needs of our customers. Our custom-designed fixed-wing airplane can fly farther, faster, and in more inclement weather conditions than a quadcopter can, enabling service to facilities 10 times as far, regardless of weather.

Redundant lithium-ion battery packs and twin electric motors enable a high level of reliability, low operating cost, and an environmentally-friendly solution.

Our airplanes fly on predetermined routes using an advanced autopilot, developed in-house to be highly-reliable in all weather conditions. A Zipline Controller monitors the airspace as our fleet of airplanes perform their missions.|||
