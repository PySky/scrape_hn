Emails are dead 💩. Let us introduce you to UniYo 👏.

- UniYo? What is it for?

- Interact with everybody on campus in a fun and easy way!

- Why is it better than email?

- Well, it’d be like asking why email is better than fax, or why fax is better than letters. Just try.

- Ok, I’ll try but once again: why is it better than email?

- Emails are super not efficient, they are boring and you have to wait for a week before getting a reply. Proof: When you contact a friend, you could send him an email but you will always use a messaging app. Why should this be any different with a classmate or with your professor?

- Alright. But why is it better than WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger?

Because students and profs are not necessarily your friends. You don’t want to chill out… you just want to chat!

You must sign up on UniYo right now. But signing up is not enough. You must invite all your classmates and your professors to join. UniYo will be efficient if each of you guys invite at least one friend to join. Otherwise you will not be allowed to say something like “Well…. UniYo could be fun if the whole campus was online” 💦 🔫

Do not forget: Be one of the first people to sign up and invite at least one friend to join because chatting alone is always embarrassing… 😳
