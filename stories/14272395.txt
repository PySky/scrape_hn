Your business is sure to flourish if you sell your services and products on-the-go. Almost everyone has access to internet via their smartphones today, so it only makes sense to have an app for your product. This makes it easy for your customers to shop while on the move.  However, when it comes to mobile app development, there is no one-size-fits-all policy. Depending on the specific needs of your business and what your customers are looking for, you can choose between native apps which integrate with single operating systems, web apps which are developed using HTML 5 or hybrid apps that combine the best of native and web apps.

More and more businesses are preferring hybrid apps over other types of app development because of the numerous benefits they offer in terms of device performance, responsiveness and user experience. As per Gartner’s, more than 50% of smartphone applications in 2016 were hybrid in nature.

So, what is a hybrid app?

Hybrid apps are cross-platform apps that leverage multiple technologies and techniques from mobile web apps and native apps.  Speaking from a business point of view, hybrid apps remove the need to develop applications from scratch for every operating platform you plan to cater to.  With cross-platform designs, hybrid apps offer better user experience than native apps and solve several other issues with web applications.

A 2014 study by VisionMobile for over 7,000 app developers found that 15% of app developer experts use web technologies to integrate with native tools, that is, in laymen terms, build hybrid apps. With higher businesses turning to smartphone marketing, these numbers are set to escalate.

Apart from a better user experience, hybrid apps have a myriad of benefits to offer. Let’s look at some of them:|||
