We loved NixOS so much, that we wanted to make it a "1st Class" operating system on the Packet platform.  We're happy to be the first cloud provider to offer it on demand.    Welcome to the family, NixOS!

Built on top of the Nix package manager, NixOS is completely declarative and makes upgrading systems reliable.  Benefits:

Declarative - You write a specification of the desired configuration of your system in NixOS’s modular language, and NixOS takes care of making it happen.

Reliable - NixOS has atomic upgrades and rollbacks. It’s always safe to try an upgrade or configuration change.

DevOps-friendly - With NixOps (the NixOS cloud deployment tool) easily provision and manage networks of NixOS machines.|||
