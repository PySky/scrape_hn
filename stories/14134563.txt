The Internet of Things is truly incredible in that it lets us stay connected with many aspects of the world around us via devices and sensors. With the rise of third platform innovations, we can monitor our home from anywhere, see how we are doing after a strenuous workout and even see how stocked our refrigerator is. But with this wonderful technology comes a lurking problem: security. As we have seen over the past few years, many hacker attacks have occurred on cars, baby monitors, video devices, and the list goes on. How can we protect ourselves from the bad guys so we can truly enjoy this technology?

Unfortunately, when all these devices started coming out, security did not seem to be on the minds of companies putting out the products. Since these devices all work over the internet, they are live and can be hacked. Now, there is a very large push for securing these devices and sensors. Standardization of best security practices is starting to take shape; however, many security holes still exist.

What can a company or individual do to protect their devices from being hacked?

Since standardization is still being figured out, users have to rely on the companies they purchased the products from to be vigilant. Some companies are great at putting out updates to quickly fix a product, while others arenâ€™t as on top of things.

Here are some of the ways to ensure safety on these devices:

1. Research the company you are buying the device from

All of these steps will help you properly secure whatever internet-enabled/IoT device you may have, whether it be a video camera, router, personal fitness monitor or other. As time goes on, more and more standards will start to come out that will ensure IoT devices are more secure to begin with, filtering out all the fly-by-night companies selling subpar, easily hackable devices.
