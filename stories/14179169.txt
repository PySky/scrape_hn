Javascript abstract art! Click on the canvas for another masterpiece.

The current implementation uses a recursive function to split the canvas up into mini boxes. This is then ajusted to add a random factor in splitting and corrected to ensure that the boxes are of a minimum size.

See also JavaScript Art: Triangles for a simpler concept.

Feel free to send me an email with a screenshot of your favorite canvas :)|||
