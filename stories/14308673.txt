A Python 3/2 Raspberry PI Character LCD library for the Hitachi HD44780 controller. It supports both GPIO (parallel) mode as well as boards with an I2C port expander (e.g. the PCF8574 or the MCP23008).

This library is inspired by Adafruit Industries' CharLCD library as well as by Arduino's LiquidCrystal library.

No external dependencies (except the library, which comes preinstalled on Raspbian) are needed to use this library.

You can install RPLCD directly from PyPI using pip:

If you want to use I2C, you also need smbus:

You can also install the library manually without pip. Either just copy the scripts to your working directory and import them, or download the repository and run to install it into your Python package directory.

These things may get implemented in the future, depending on my free time and motivation:
