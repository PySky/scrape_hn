Since proposing Grid Layout to the CSS Working Group and shipping an experimental implementation in IE10, we have been heavily invested in advancing it through the standard process.

Today we’re pleased to announce that work has begun on updating our implementation to the latest Candidate Recommendation spec. We’re excited about the level of developer and implementor interest in Grid Layout, and look forward to see how it will be used on the Web.
