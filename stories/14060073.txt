Hetzner Online has recently introduced its first ever dedicated root server with an incredibly powerful graphics card: the EX51-SSD-GPU! The GeForce® GTX 1080, with its highly parallel architecture, can perform many processes simultaneously and efficiently, thus increasing overall performance. It also houses an Intel® Core i7-6700 Quadcore processor built using Skylake architecture, 64 GB DDR4 RAM, and last but certainly not least, two 500 GB 6 Gb/s SSDs.

 

 The EX51-SSD-GPU dedicated root server is perfect for any applications that requires the processing of large amounts of graphical data, especially images and videos. Further applications include big data analytics, customer information processing, and highly sophisticated encryption techniques. It has resources to handle calculations needed for all kinds of machine learning, as well as a wide array of scientific and industrial research. 

 

 You can get your hands on this server model for an incredibly low € 99.00 per month plus a one-time setup fee of € 99.00.
