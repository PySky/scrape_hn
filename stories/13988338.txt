I’ve been writing a lot about intentionality in data science, about how having a sense of history (present and future), can be incredibly powerful for any enterprise.

Think about how archaeologists use data to seek the truth, as compared with how astronomers do it.

Archaeology starts with digging. It’s all about studying the data that’s buried in the system (i.e. the fossil record), which means studying things that probably weren’t put there intentionally (depending on your belief system). Without a time machine, it’s impossible to change the structure of the record, to apply intention to the signal, so we do the best we can with what we’ve got: we mine through the accidental signals, discarding the (literal) mountains of noise, in an effort to find the truth about history. Perhaps as should be expected, this effort is expensive and leads to mixed results.

On the other hand, Astronomy is a very different field. Astronomy starts way earlier than digging — it starts with planting. At instrumentation-time, astronomers can point the telescopes where they want, measuring and recording the signals they want. Unlike archaeologists, astronomers have the ability to design the record and its structure, to choose the signals with intention. Doing this intentionally sets up the data record to yield the discoveries they already know they want to make, but also to be somewhat future-proof (which means it can yield unpredicted, emergent discoveries, to be harvested down the road — often by different people than the planters).|||
