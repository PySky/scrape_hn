When I retired nine years ago, I launched this blog in an effort to continue a lifetime of teaching.  At first, terrified that my active life had ended, I plunged into a lengthy autobiography and then into a series of tutorials, mini-tutorials and appreciations so extended that very soon I had written more than half a million words.  But blogging is unlike teaching.  It is lonely, impersonal, episodic.  There are no faces, no eyes widening or narrowing, no sense of the passage of human time.  Each post is, as it were, born yesterday.  I recall with longing the master classes I have watched in which an old cellist or violinist listens to a young, eager aspirant and breaks in from time to time to shape a phrase or correct a bowing, offering his or her lifetime of experience to help the young student transmute notes into music and music into art.|||
