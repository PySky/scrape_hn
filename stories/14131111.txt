There’s a famous quote by Walt Disney’s on money:

There’s a myth we like to tell about artists.

The only real artists, we say, are the ones that are poor and starving. As soon as an artist “makes it” and is rewarded with cash, they’ve now “sold out” and forsaken their craft.

Sure, this happens sometimes.

But assuming this is true for everyone is a classic case of the fallacy of composition — just because some artists sell out once they start making money does not mean all artists do.

There’s something romantic about the poor, starving artist. But not earning money is disrespectful to your work, says Walt Disney:

That’s exactly how I feel about my writing.

If I didn’t make money from writing, I’d still want to spend all day reading books and sharing ideas with others. But I’d have a lot less time to actually do it.

The solution is not to reject all money and live a frugal life. Rather, the answer lies in making a living while not selling out.

This platform — Medium — is filled with internet marketers who only care about cashing out.

But that’s not everyone.

There are plenty of people here with something to say.

I can’t guarantee I’ll never “sell out,” but here are some steps I’m taking to protect myself:
