As his taxi splashes through torrential rain in Yan’an, a Chinese rustbelt city that is more used to dust and humidity, Bei Yuhong sighs under his breath: “I am really not satisfied at all”.

It’s not the weather that is getting Bei down, it’s the heavy burden of responsibility supporting a family that he rarely sees, given his long hours.

Bei earns just over £200 a month driving his Chinese-made Volkswagen around Yan’an, the cradle of China’s Communist Revolution .

Mao Tse-tung based his headquarters in this remote valley in Shaanxi province, promising a brighter future for workers and peasants as his armies fought the Nationalist forces and, sporadically, the Japanese.

But for a salary that is less than half the national average, Bei works 12 hours for 13 continuous days, until he is finally able to rest – for a day at least.

“There is quite a lot of pressure for people like me,” says Bei, who continues to scan the roadsides despite having a fare-paying customer, as he seeks to give pedestrians shelter from the rain – for an extra 5-10 yuan (50p-£1) each.

Working long hours is common in China, where hairdressing salons are open until late in the evening, and construction sites continue around the clock, much to the anger of sleepless residents.

Estate agents, nannies and retailers both on the high street and on China’s hugely popular e-commerce sites are just some of the workers who would rarely utter the term "out-of-hours".

That is why, for many Chinese, the national holidays are considered sacred. This is particularly true for the 253 million migrants who return home from the booming coastal cities to their rural villages during China’s Lunar New Year holidays.

"Chunjie", as its called in China, is the one safe-haven for many families from the demands of the relentless Chinese economy.

But for Bei, who was working on a holiday during the "Golden Week", which began on China’s National Day last Thursday, there was no respite.

He says he needs to work around the clock to support his wife, who is not employed, and his 15-year-old son.

“This is just what you have to do,” he says with a smile, as he crunches his gears aggressively.
