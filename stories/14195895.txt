This PrefixStore is implemented via an in-memory trie capable of storing only . This should be used when you know that the data you would put in only has ASCII characters. No one is stopping you from putting any kind of .

This PrefixStore is implemented via an in-memory trie capable of storing only . This is useful when you want to store data that might have UTF-8 characters.
