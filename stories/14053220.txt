And then there were five.

Hulu, the popular purveyor of on-demand TV shows from major networks, as well as original series such as "The Handmaid's Tale," is the latest company to offer live TV streaming over the internet.

Its new plan, called Hulu with Live TV, costs $40 per month, includes all of the on-demand shows and movies found on regular Hulu, and is designed to replace traditional cable TV.

Hulu with Live TV competes directly with four similar services: Google's YouTube TV, Dish Network's Sling TV, Sony's PlayStation Vue, and AT&T's DirecTV Now. All of them offer different slates of channels for various prices and share a few common traits.

Unlike standard cable or satellite plans, there's no annual contract and you can cancel and reup anytime. Of course, you'll need a good broadband plan that can support HD video streaming, as well as a supported phone, tablet, computer and/or TV streaming device to actually watch it.

We've created a chart that compares channel lineups for Hulu and the others. It's arranged in alphabetical order by channel name, grouped roughly into three quality tiers, with more popular channels listed toward the top.

Hulu and YouTube TV have just one package, so we've denoted available channels with a simple Yes or No (or "Coming Soon" for certain channels that have been announced but aren't yet available). The others offer more channels to people who pay more money, so for them we've listed the names of their packages, if the channel is available, instead of "Yes."
