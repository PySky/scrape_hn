A cluttered email inbox can be overwhelming and cause you to be unproductive. When you open your email client, does it inform you that you have 23,037 unread messages? Trust me, I’ve been there and a clean inbox is much easier to deal with.

These are the steps I use to stay productive with email:

In step I mention the use of a "snooze" function. As far as I’m aware, this feature doesn’t exist in all email clients but it does help a lot. If your email client doesn’t support snoozing, you can use a separate "snooze" folder and set manual reminders to drag those messages back into your inbox to be dealt with.

As far as email clients go, I use Newton. I’ve tried a lot of different clients, and so far this has definitely been my favourite.

Keeping a spiffy inbox has helped me reply to emails more quickly and waste less time managing email. I highly recommend it.|||
