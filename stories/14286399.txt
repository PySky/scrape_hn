In the days of the typewriters, some letters which are often used often jams when they are used frequently. To solve this problem, Christopher Latham Sholes attempted to solve this problem by placing them further away from each other. E. Remington eventually developed this into the QWERTY keyboard. When the computer was invented, most people are already used to the QWERTY keyboard and so it is continued to be used.|||
