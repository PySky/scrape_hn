Any Linux distribution that is updated to the latest release with all the security patches applied is going to have vulnerabilities. Security patches are often created after the vulnerability is discovered. And every distribution will have some lag from when an upstream library releases a fix until it is incorporated into the distribution. When you drill into many of the listed vulnerabilities, you'll often find that the distribution does not have a patch available yet.

Just because an image contains vulnerabilities doesn't mean that it is exploitable. Often the vulnerabilities are with various included libraries which may not even be called when accessing the container through any of the published ports.

For example, some list exploits that allow privilege escalation from a user to root, but many containers run as root already since the root user has added restrictions and can only access the single app. And other exploits may require a library to parse a file, which if your webserver doesn't parse pictures from unknown sources, it may not be possible to use this exploit against your container.

Personally, I feel that Docker is simply shining a light on an issue that has always existed but has been easy to ignore. Without these reports, people assume that applying all the security patches available means they've fixed every known vulnerability. And without Docker they are running applications on these systems without any isolation between the various applications, making an exploit in one application easy to expand and expose every other application and included data on the same machine.|||
