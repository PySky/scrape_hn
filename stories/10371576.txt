Government officials in India and the Gulf had to wait until the early twentieth century for the introduction of the teleprinter, which combined the ease of creating letters on a typewriter with the speed of telegraphic communication.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, British officials extended their administration over the Gulf through continued technological improvements and the increased speed and reliability of the telecommunications network. The introduction of wireless telegraphy, for example, first pioneered by Guglielmo Marconi in the 1890s, paved the way for telegraphic communications to be established between Bushire and Bahrain, Muscat and Sharjah.
