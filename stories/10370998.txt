Your front-page article on the rising tide of obesity and overweight (10 October) brings welcome sharp focus on the devastating role a broken food system is playing in maximising profits at the expense of public health.

While this attention is essential, it is important not to neglect the disastrous effect of sedentarity, driven – as pointed out by Dr Lobstein of the World Obesity Federation – by inadequate urban design and transport systems.

In this arena the UK fares particularly badly. Unpleasant and broken infrastructure for walkers and cyclists is widespread. While we desperately need better attention and scrutiny on the food industry, we are in danger of letting town, road and transport planners off the hook by our failure to monitor, report and advocate for an infrastructure that makes walking and cycling a safe, pleasant and effective everyday option.

We have clear examples of what is possible and what works from our neighbours Holland and Denmark. We need to learn from them and build the lessons into our huge roads and planning budgets, and move beyond tokenistic projects with tiny impact.

Our public health and NGO advocates need to step up to this task and be more regular and rigorous in holding those responsible to account. Only by tackling the broken food and transport systems together will we have a fighting chance to turn the tide on the obesity epidemic.
