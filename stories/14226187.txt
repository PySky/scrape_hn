By assigning conventional note on/off messages into “note channels”, the MPE proposed specification enables continuous control parameters to be attached to individual active notes. These parameters can be used to represent continuously changing per-note pitch bend, pressure and timbre.

The working group is supported by ROLI, Apple, Bitwig, Moog, Haken and Roger Linn Design. It is currently implemented in ROLI’s Equator and NOISE software synthesizers, as well as Logic X, Bitwig Studio and Cubase.

A C++ implementation is also available, included in JUCE.|||
