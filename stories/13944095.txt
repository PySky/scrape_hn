Hi everyone! I'm Anthony Faria and I've been designing professionally for 15+ years delivering industry recognized creative solutions in digital media, print, experiential, product UX/UI, advertising, marketing and branding design. You can check out some of my work here or follow me on Twitter (@a_fariadesign) I attended the Rhode Island School of Design and received BFA from The University of the Arts. For the past 12 years, I have been bringing to life brands and building smart, innovative products. We take simple ideas and develop complete user experiences which have included cohesive branding, marketing and advertising campaigns that support award-winning designed mobile products. I have also been a Creative Director at 'Top 5 US Web Property' and New York based mobile startup for 8 years now. Ask me anything!
