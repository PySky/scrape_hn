Details about Google's new mystery operating system, Fuchsia, appeared on Ars Technica on Tuesday and give us a better idea of what Fuchsia is for.

Based on Ars Technica's findings, Fuchsia is designed to work on "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors" with "non-trivial amounts of RAM." That seems like an odd move for Google, as Android runs perfectly well on budget devices with lesser specs. It's usually third-party apps that require speedy components to perform at their best.

We have seen that Fuchsia is built from the ground up and based on Google's Magenta kernel instead of the Linux kernel Android is based on. A kernel is the core of an operating system that the basic functions are built from. A kernel is like an empty house (Linux) that the tenant (Google) can furnish to work, look, and feel the way it wants. By building a kernel, Google has more control over what its OS can do.

Check out Ars Technica's screenshots of Fuchsia to get a look at Google's new OS. In the meantime, I've compiled a few screenshots from YouTube user Kyle Bradshaw, who uploaded a video on Wednesday showing Fuchsia running on a mobile device.|||

It's far from finished, but it doesn't even have app icons.
