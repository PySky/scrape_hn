You can create a new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.6.2 database instance with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, or upgrade an existing PostgreSQL 9.5 database instance using a point-and-click upgrade. Upgrading from version 9.3 and 9.4 requires you to perform a point-and-click upgrade to the next major version, reaching version 9.5 before upgrading to 9.6.2. Each upgrade operation involves a short period of unavailability for your database instance. Learn more about upgrading your database instances from the Amazon RDS User Guide.



Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL deployments in the cloud. See Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Pricing for regional availability.|||
