Abstract: Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what. This makes cryptography an inherently political tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically moral dimension. The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral positioning of cryptography. They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our field. I believe that it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to resist mass surveillance. I plead for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal implications of our work.

Note: This is a paper I wrote to accompany my invited talk at Asiacrypt 2015. It is not a standard research paper. The talk was delivered on December 2, 2015, in Auckland, New Zealand.

Some things I say: For reasons unknown, Chatterjee, Koblitz, Menezes, and Sarkar (2016) (update) attribute to my essay a set of claims (update) that I neither make nor believe. While I promptly informed the authors that they were misrepresenting what I write and think, they responded that they stand by their claims. I guess these authors must what I wrote and believe better than I do. Please read the actual essay, not a highly inaccurate summary of it.
