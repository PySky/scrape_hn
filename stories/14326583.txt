This uses WebPageTest.org to measure web page load speed on articles from a variety of news organizations and publishers and highlight the top ten.

Benchmarking across different sites is hard. The aspirational goal is measuring perceptual load time - when the reader 'thinks' the page has loaded. For now this provides benchmarks to monitor.

Tests run twice daily. Results are averaged of last 5 tests over a simulated LTE connection. There's probably a better way of doing it but there you go.
