This 12-unit course digs into the application of Artificial Intelligence to Games—focusing on core techniques, essential skills and principles transferable from one domain to another. Lessons (1h) are released incrementally and combine short videos with exercises & optional coding.

The course is aimed at technically-oriented developers, and the Main track should be generally accessible to designers, testers and producers. The primary audience consists of Software Engineers though, and there will be an Advanced track with programming exercises too.

The course itself is available under a “Pay What You Want” model, including a free option! AiGameDev.com PREMIUM and ULTIMATE memberships unlock access to related materials and separate features such as statistics or course completion certificates.
