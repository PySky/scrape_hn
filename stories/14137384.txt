After a couple of weeks, the wafers arrived. Meanwhile, I started collecting parts that I would use to showcase them. My idea was to put each wafer in a frame with a passepartout and illuminating them with an LED. So off I went on a trip to a nearby IKEA to gather some parts.

Now, I prefer minimalism, so I don’t want to have any wires exposed used to power the LEDs. So I ordered some more parts to allow the frames to be wireless. I got six 2200 mAh rechargeable cells that I estimated allow the frames to have about 70 hours of light (This wasn’t the case, unfortunately).

After all parts came in, I started soldering and wiring up the batteries, charging modules and step-up converters. At first, I noticed that soldering a lead on a Li-Ion cell is quite hard, so I used some sanding paper to make the surface of the terminals more rough.

After combining all electronic components, the result were six sets.|||

Silicon wafers are often used as a base for manufacturing micro-electronic components, using a process called photolithography. With this process, schematics of integrated circuits can be “etched…
