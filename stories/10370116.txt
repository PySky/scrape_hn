If you install gpg and then type: gpg --gen-key, it 'freezes up' during the entropy gathering phase.

 We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform

 some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the

 disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number

 generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available. Please do some other work to give

 the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 278 more bytes)

I found some reference on the interwebs suggesting to install rng-tools so that the rngd daemon can gather more entropy for the system because by default cat /proc/sys/ kernel/ random/ entropy_ avail has a very very low number.

Thus, installation of rng-tools, fails to start the rngd daemon...

And cat /proc/sys/ kernel/ random/ entropy_ avail has a much higher number.

All in all, I think this process should be simplified by maybe making gpg depend on rng-tools. The whole reason why I need to generate a gpg key is because I want to sign the .deb debians that I'm creating for my repository.

Thanks for your time.|||
