On August 21st the Go community gathered in London for the first edition of Golang UK. The conference featured two parallel tracks and nearly 400 gophers attended.

The conference started with the opening keynote by David Calavera called Crossing the Language Chasm (video) and continued with two concurrently executed tracks.

Finally Damian Gryski took the stage for the closing keynote (video), giving an overview of how the Go community has evolved over time and hinting to what the future might look like.

On the day before the conference William Kennedy gave a full day Go workshop.

It was a great conference, so congratulations to the organizers and see you next year in London!|||
