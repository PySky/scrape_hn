As people submit your form, you'll see submissions tickle in in our interface. You can even set up to be notified for every response - that way you don't have to log in to check.

You can also email the person that submitted the form, notifying them that you have received it. Personalize the email you send them by using merge tags, so you can refer data that they have submitted.|||

Your own form on your own website. No iframes or javascript needed. You control the form, we collect the data. Works great with Wordpress, Github pages or other static websites.
