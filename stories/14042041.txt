Brexit! TIGA, the network for games developers and digital publishers and the trade association representing the UK video games industry, published the following statement in the light of the UK’s decision to initiate Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union and begin the process of leaving the EU.

Dr Richard Wilson, TIGA CEO and Jason Kingsley OBE, TIGA Chairman and CEO and Creative Director at Rebellion, said:

“TIGA, the trade association representing the video games industry, is engaging with Government, Parliament and interested third parties to ensure that creative and technological sectors, including the video games industry, continue to succeed following Brexit.

“Today is a historic day. Opportunities and risks lie ahead. It is now more important than ever to realise TIGA’s vision to make the UK the best place in the world for games development, games education and games service providers. If you share this vision and want to make it a reality, then contact Dr Richard Wilson, TIGA CEO, to discuss how you can get involved in our campaign (richard.wilson@tiga.org ).”|||
