which is pretty good for start. Now we have a model, but this does not solely depend on the accuracy but on the domain and business requirements of the problem. If we predict a customer with ait means we are going to approve the credit loan for the customer who will end up not paying it, which will cause losses to the bank. However, if we predict a customer withit means we will deny him the loan in which case the bank will neither profit nor will incur any losses. This is much better than incurring huge losses by wrongly predicting bad credit ratings as good.|||
