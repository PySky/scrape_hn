There are 6 types of coders I have found recently.

Coders are highly creative folks, and the exciting thing about my job is I always get to work with them asking them a lot of questions: how, why, when, etc.

I always get interesting answers, and after working with the creative bunch of coders at Shippable for six months, I have come up with a few broad categories that developers and coders tend to belong. But, before we get to these broad categories, let’s review some of the traits of coders:

1. The Perfectionist — Comes on time, does his stuff, leaves on time. Fixes a whole bunch of issues and is never late on deadlines.

2. The Street Smart Freak — Copy pastes a lot of things from the internet, and although they don’t know the principles behind everything they somehow get things to work as expected.

3. The Theoretical Dude — Knows a load of theory about computer science and coding, but not that great at coding. Gets into an argument with any who disagrees with him on theoretical aspects.

4. The Sloppy Fellow — Knows the problem, knows how to fix it, but ends up blowing things up because of some lack of concentration.

5. The Code Police — A review nazi, difficult to get a PR approved, catches all the bugs but lets the others fix the bugs, and argues about code indentation.

6. Wildcard or Eureka Guy — They keep trying new stuff, a kind of growth hacker.

Recently, I added a poll on HashNode asking coders where they belong in these categories (unfortunately, I could add only four categories there) and it was the top trending post on HashNode that day. Around 130 coders and developers participated in the poll, and the results were just astonishing.

Interestingly, I found many consider themselves Street Smart Freaks.

OK, now that I have come up with these categories, it’s going to be a bonus point for all the coders out there to look at themselves and know where they belong, and improve their rank in the leader-board within the category they belong.

Very cool. Here are the usual suggestions below:

Still confused on what type of coding you want to learn? Let’s break it down,

Any of the many “Learn to Code” sites mentioned above will do fine.

Now, take a deep breath and choose who you really want to be. With the chaos that is software development, you must choose your category in such way that you can be very competitive in that class/category.

So let me know what type of coder are you or want to be?
