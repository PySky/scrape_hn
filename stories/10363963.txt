Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.

ngx_brotli is a set of two nginx modules:

Both Brotli library and nginx module are under active development.

Enables or disables checking of the existence of pre-compressed files with extension. With the value, pre-compressed file is used in all cases, without checking if the client supports it.

Enables on-the-fly compression of responses for the specified MIME types in addition to . The special value matches any MIME type. Responses with the MIME type are always compressed.

Sets the and of buffers used to compress a response. By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page. This is either or , depending on a platform.

Sets Brotli quality (compression) . Acceptable values are in the range from to .

Sets the minimum of a response that will be compressed. The length is determined only from the response header field.

Achieved compression ratio, computed as the ratio between the original and compressed response sizes.|||
