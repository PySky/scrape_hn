This is the relative cost of the site based on data from the ITU and World Bank. The cost of data is standardized based on the factor. The cost then has affordability factored in by comparing to the per capita (broken down to a daily number). Prices were collected from the operator with the largest marketshare in the country, using the least expensive plan with a (minimum) data allowance of 500 MB over (a minimum of) 30 days. Prices include taxes. Because these numbers are based on the least expensive plan, they are best case scenarios.|||
