A couple of days after last monthâ€™s blog post about sha1sum benchmarks some researchers showed, that SHA-1 can be broken in practice. However this does not invalidate the test results.

I ran the code on my mid 2011 MacBook Air on a SSD drive. The following table lists the runtime of the code. As an input file I used a random 100 MB file.

And again, these results are not really scientifically sound, but show the by far best performance for Go. Python really lacks behind this time, while it was quite fast for the processing of sha1 values.

These results let myself to the decision to use Go for my forensic projects, to be able to cope with huge amounts of data in an appropriate time.|||
