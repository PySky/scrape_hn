Buttfinex almost certainly did have "bank issues" with Wells Fargo that prevented withdrawals of real money through that bank, as demonstrated by their lawsuit (that they have retracted, AFAIK).

Buttfinex probably had the same "issues" will other banks. The explanation offered was that Taiwan is under international pressure to clean its act on AML/KYC. (But the attempt to sue WF may have contributed too.)

That said, the issues had the effect of blocking all real money withdrawals from Buttfinex. That actually seems to have been good for Buttfinex and for all bit-coin hodlers -- except those who have their bit-coins and dollars in Buttfinex, or those who have their bit-coins in the Chinese exchanges (which are blocking withdrawals in crypto instead).

As expected, the BTC price at Buttfinex skyrocketed, as desperate clients started buying BTC at a huge premium in order to get their worth out. But that may be the best explanation also for the rally in other exchanges, like Buttstamp.

Namely, it seems likely that many butters are buying bit-coins at Buttstamp and sending them to Buttfinex, in order to "profit" from the huge spread ($1517 to $1621). They either may be unaware of the "bank issues", or are betting that they will be resolved eventually and they can take their dollar profits out.

So, while the "bank issues" may not have been intentional, most hodlers must be fervently praying that they last as long as possible. And Buttfinex must not be in any hurry to resolve them either.

It may be worth recalling also that Buttfinex recently returned to its clients the real money that it had confiscated after the hack, by crediting their fiat accounts with said amounts --- AFAIK, after the real money withdrawals were blocked.

EDIT: fiat --> real money. Shame on me for the slip.|||
