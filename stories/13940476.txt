A Silicon Valley startup claims it has created a giant robot that can digitize boxfuls of old documents 10 times as fast as the competition — and create, rather than kill, factory jobs in the process.

The robots are remarkably adept at human-like tasks, including pulling staples and fasteners out of paper bundles, and sifting through piles of mixed-up documents like letters, pink invoices and business cards, says Ripcord co-founder and CEO Alex Fielding.

Nevertheless, he insists they’ll create jobs — mainly because, until now, sorting through all of the stuff has been such an expensive pain in the neck that most businesses haven’t bothered.

“There will be no more holding records hostage in massive warehouses or nickel-and-diming customers at every step in the digitization process,” says Fielding, a former Apple engineer.

As it looks to disrupt a “stale, outdated,” $25 billion warehouse-storage industry, Ripcord says it will be hiring hundreds of workers to feed its robots with banker boxes full of old papers for a growing roster of clients.

Ripcord charges $0.0004 a page per month — a price that includes transportation, scanning, indexing, auto-categorization, and connections to other popular systems from data companies like Oracle and SAP. This makes digitization accessible to companies of all sizes.

“We believe robots and humans should work together,” a Ripcord rep says.

 The startup predicts its current facility in Hayward, Calif., will be processing 50 million files a day by the end of 2018.

Ripcord on Thursday raised $9.5 million in series A funding from venture firm Kleiner Perkins as well as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.|||
