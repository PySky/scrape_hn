Workers gain access to more work applications through VMware Horizon desktop virtualization along with an added bonus: one click authentication and application management. Workspace ONE on Chromebooks and other Chrome OS devices simplifies the secure login process with SSO, or single sign on. Employees can then access the applications they need to get work done through a managed software catalog.



Sumit Dhawan, senior vice president and general manager, End-User Computing, VMware says “We believe the combination of VMware Workspace ONE and Chrome OS will provide increased security and accessibility to applications for customers using the platform. This is just the first step in our collaboration on this platform with more to come.”

IDC estimates that by 2018, 25% of Fortune 500 companies will have IT-supported Chromebooks deployed in their organization thanks to the speed, simplicity and shareability of secure Chromebooks.
