BlackBerry with Android Operating smartphone, isn’t this sound just great? There are few smartphones of BlackBerry with Android Operating System which are around five devices. One of them is BlackBerry Aurora.

That is the smartphone I am going to talk about in this blog. This Smartphone is a low to mid range smartphone, so nothing spectacular about this, but lets get to the business.

Blackberry Aurora is coming lased with Android Nougat, which is the latest Android OS by far. This smartphone is developed in Indonesia. The BlackBerry Aurora is launched by partner of BlackBerry from Indonesia, “BB Merah Putih”.

Indonesia boasts the world’s largest population of BlackBerry Smartphone users. So, BlackBerry decided to create device, BlackBerry Aurora is specifically designed to appeal to Indonesian customers.

For starters, it is the first ever Dual SIM BlackBerry Smartphone, letting users easily separate personal and business calls in one phone. Of course there are many Smartphone with Dual SIM by others but it is the first time for BlackBerry.

This latest development under licensing strategy of BlackBerry represents a critical step in bringing BlackBerry branded smartphones to customers from all over the world.

Not only do the 250 million Indonesian consumers represent a massive and fast emerging market, but Indonesia is a hub of innovation and BB Merah Putih is a fine example of that with its world class manufacturing and design.

Built on the World’s most secure Android Software platform, the Android Nougat v7.0 based BlackBerry Aurora is made in Indonesia, and will deliver many features.

BlackBerry which made their name with QWERTY keypad smartphone, are also well known for their security features. So, this is same as any other BlackBerry device. It do have BlackBerry Software to make it more secured.

With a wide screen width of 5.5 inches, allows users to access the menu, watch videos and play these smartphone features with more leverage. The screen is equipped with high definition features with a resolution of 72 x 1280 pixels which makes it look more clear.

This BlackBerry Aurora will provide connectivity options like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, 4G and also USB On the Go. It is also lased with sensors like Compass, Magnetometer,  Proximity sensor, Accelerometer and Ambient light sensor.

The BlackBerry Aurora is powered by Snapdragon 425 processor with 4 GB of RAM, which is quite a lot for this small processor. It also features 3000 mAh Battery, which is quite a lot because again this smartphone is powered by small processor, it looks like that it will get passed a One day with this battery easily.

So, we will have enough power for the day or may be even two days, which sounds good to me. Than it comes with 32 GB of internal storage as well as Expandable storage of 256 GB which looks good for this small size of smartphone to handle.

BlackBerry Aurora has 13 Mega Pixel on the back of the phone as the primary camera, it also has the selfie camera on the front of 8 Mega Pixels. Considering the features in camera, there is a New mode in Camera.

This new mode of camera is called E-Aperture. Which means you can chase the exposure time. So, as I said you can expose images for a longer amount of time. So, if you shoot waterfall and when you expose the waterfall for a longer amount of time, the water will seem very smooth and like edited with Photoshop and you can do that with the BlackBerry Aurora.

BlackBerry Aurora comes with the Android Nougat v7.0, which seems like it will come before the BlackBerry mercury which is now BlackBerry KEYone.

So, the BlackBerry Aurora will be the first BlackBerry phone to ship with Android Nougat and it will come with all the BlackBerry features, you expect like BlackBerry DTEK, the calendar app, the library hub and all about we have to come.

So, the BlackBerry Aurora seems like to come with the photo app which seems a bit different to the other BlackBerry smartphones. So, it looks a lot like the iPhone. It almost seemed like an insect copy of the iPhone. So, yeah maybe that is faced with us.

Rest of the World: Yet to be announced

The BlackBerry really did the work on this BlackBerry Aurora. Although they made it with keeping Indonesian customers as target, I hope this device will be liked by other countries too.

Although, in some countries everyone buys those Flagship phones with high Specs, likes of Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+, LG G6, HTC U Ultra and Xiaomi Mi Mix. So, I am not sure that this low specs smartphone of BlackBerry will get the nerve out of the customers to sell it to them.

But, for the customers with low budget for smartphone, this could be a good choice from such big brand like BlackBerry. So, what do you think about this smartphone? Are you going to look out for this one?
