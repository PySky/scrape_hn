We proudly present to you our film about Polish chef Maciej Nowicki. We wanted to tell the story of someone who digs deep into a culinary identity of Poland. That is why we sneaked into the kitchen of Villa Intrata in Warsaw’s Museum of King Jan III’s Palace at Wilanów. 

 Maciej is not the most famous Polish chef, he doesn’t even cook for the public.
