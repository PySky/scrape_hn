Maxeler is proud to announce its Real Time Risk product on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) F1 Instances, starting with a Counterparty Risk instance for pre-trade Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) on Amazon Web Service (AWS). With General Availability of the Amazon EC2 F1 Instances and the Maxeler collaboration with AWS, Maxeler is expecting to start serving initial customers with CVA on F1 by the end of the month. “It’s great to see Maxeler’s high performance technology now being implemented on AWS for clients,” says Geoff Smailes, Chairman at Maxeler Technologies.

Maxeler Dataflow Engines (DFEs) are already used in Production for several years. “We are proud that our latest MAX5 DFEs are fully compatible with Amazon EC2 F1 Instances,” says Oskar Mencer, CEO of Maxeler Technologies, “One such DFE implementation for Real Time FX Risk has recently been installed at a Tier 1 investment bank.”

Maxeler Real Time Risk is a rich suite of Finance Risk tools and components, including CVA, SIMM but also a full derivatives pricing library, driven by Bloomberg market data. Clients can upload their trades and portfolios using the industry standard FPML format. RTR runs on AWS CPU cloud instances or for ultrafast real time purposes on Amazon EC2 F1 Instances. For complex risk models, Maxeler DFE implementations reduce compute times from hours to minutes and minutes to seconds.

Maxeler RTR is available both on the Cloud and on-premise with Maxeler’s MAX5 product generation which is fully compatible with Amazon EC2 F1 Instances. RTR is also ideal for building your own solutions for FRTB, CCR and extended scenario analysis. RTR comes with complete dashboards as well as an optional API based library with full source code.|||
