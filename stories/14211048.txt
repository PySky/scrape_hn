Don't be worried by complexity of this banner, with latest version of docker installed correctly, you can run Deep Video Analytics in minutes locally (even without a GPU) using a single command.

Please contact me for more information, I plan on relaxing the license soon. For more information about the approximate timeline see my answer on this issue|||
