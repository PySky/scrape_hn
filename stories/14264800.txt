Alphabet's Google unit (GOOGL) said Thursday that it will pay $334 million, or 306 million euros to settle an issue with Italy's tax authority.

Italian tax police alleged last year that Google had not paid about 1 billion euros of Italian revenue between 2009 and 2013.

"In addition to the taxes already paid in Italy during those years, Google will pay another 306 million euros," a Google spokeswoman told Reuters.

Other European countries have also accused Google of avoiding taxes by booking income earned in higher-taxing markets through its Ireland unit, where taxes are lower.|||
