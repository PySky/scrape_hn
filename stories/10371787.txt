James Allworth, co-author of “How will you measure your life” with Clay Christensen and Karen Dillon, joined us in an interesting discussion on the book and his reflections on disruption theory. From discussing motivational factors to why you should not outsource your childcare, James offered his thoughts and perspectives to how we can draw valuable ideas from businesses to apply to our lives. Finally, we have a short chat on James’ current podcast “Exponent” with Ben Thompson and also his thoughts on disruption theory and “jobs to be done” framework applying to not just Asian but global companies as a whole.

Here are the interesting show notes and links to the discussion (with timestamps included):
