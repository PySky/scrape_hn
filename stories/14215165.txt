The photographs below all come from the Lenkin Family Collection of Photography which comprises part of the University of Pennsylvania Libraries’s Holy Land Digital Image Collection. The Penn Libraries are grateful to Edward Lenkin (C’71, PAR’12) for a major gift which made it possible to acquire approximately 5,000 photographs of the Holy Land dating from ca. 1850–1937.

Recently, an exhibit, curated by Hila Fishman, went on display in the Kamin Gallery in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library, entitled “Insight: Seeing the People of the Holy Land, Collections from the Lenkin Family Collection of Photography.” While these photographs contain people, the focus is not really on them, but rather on the purpose that they serve for the photographer, whether it was to show the scale of a Pyramid, reenact a biblical scene, or epitomize Western Christian notions of the Holy Land.
