Here at Mint, we’re big fans of Elixir. We’re aware that deployment is sometimes painful, through our own experience, and through talk we’ve heard in the wider community.

With this in mind, we set out to test the following:

Respondees were self-selecting: having found and chosen to read the blog post, they went on to fill out the survey with no promise of a reward. Given this, it seems reasonable to assume anyone responding has a fair interest in Elixir already.

We used 3 questions to test our hypotheses:
