Last week I turned 30. Unlike most people, I do like getting older. 10 years ago, I was a complete idiot.

Now, a decade later, I still know nothing, but I do feel more in control of my life. I thank that personal growth to an idea I stole from Socrates, the person who was once named the wisest man on earth by the Oracle of Delphi.

When Socrates heard that the oracle had made such a comment, he believed that the statement was wrong. Socrates said:

How can the smartest man on earth know nothing? I heard this paradoxical wisdom for the first time from my school teacher when I was 14 or 15. That humility made such an impact on me that I used Socrates’s quote as my learning strategy.

What you will find below is a list of the most important things I learned from others. We might learn things quickly, but we often forget things at the same rate — and sometimes we need to remind ourselves of the things we’ve learned.

Here are 30 of those reminders that others taught me.

You might know a lot. But like Socrates, you and I know nothing at all. So we have to keep learning.|||

Socrates said: “I know one thing: that I know nothing.” Use the same mindset to improve your life. Learn from everyone and everything.
