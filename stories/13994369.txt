After today’s big and long-awaited launch event, Samsung has already begun taking pre-orders for its new flagship, the Galaxy S8. Fans in Canada, for example, can already place them, eventually receiving the handset as soon as April 17. Telus, one of the biggest carriers in the country, even confirmed the latter, through an official statement.

However, they’re not the only ones who already offer clients the chance to get their hands on one of the most desired phones of the moment. Bell has also listed the flagship on their website, claiming that anybody who places a pre-order before April 11 will eventually receive it as early as April 18.

The regular Samsung Galaxy S8, with the 5.8″ display, has a starting price of CAD 1,035 in Canada, which roughly translates to $775, while the Samsung Galaxy S8+, with the 6.2″ display, retails for CAD 1,115 (about $835).

As for the colors Samsung’s flagship duo is available in, you can pick from Midnight Blue, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue and Maple Gold. However, we’re looking forward to seeing even more color options in other regions, at least, considering that previous leaks were pointing to even more variants.

No matter which option you pick, the Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with a resolution of 1440 x 2960 pixels, a Snapdragon 835 under the hood, accompanied by 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage, while on the back, it has a 12MP camera, teaming up with an 8MP front-facing snapper. Both models are running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, with TouchWiz on top.|||
