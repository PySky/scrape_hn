The co-chairs released the following joint statement regarding formation of the caucus:

“We are proud to announce the launch of the Congressional Caucus on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Technologies. As these technologies continue to advance and grow, this ‘Reality Caucus’ will work to foster information sharing between Congress and our nation’s world-leading technology industry. These technologies have shown tremendous potential for innovation in the fields of entertainment, education and healthcare. As these technologies develop, questions will inevitably rise in privacy, intellectual property and other areas. This is an opportunity to educate our colleagues and others to ensure Congress is doing all it can to encourage – rather than hinder – these enterprising fields. We look forward to working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help support innovation and address the challenges posed by this emerging sector.”

The Congressional Caucus on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Technologies will work to promote the advancing technologies of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality to Members of Congress and their teams.|||
