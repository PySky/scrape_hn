Headline – “Road accident tolls drop by 50% in last 12 months thanks to Tesla” There have been numerous articles and views on driverless cars and there are more than twenty serious players across the globe with the right vision, passion for technology, and intent to bring about this change, and capital. Seems like a far fetched goal don’t you think? Well, maybe, maybe not. The number and company could be anything (several companies could be listed too). I strongly feel that the twenty-odd companies (there may be more too!) in this space will make this dream a reality sooner than they, and the world is expecting.There have been numerous articles and views on driverless cars and there are more than twenty serious players across the globe with the right vision, passion for technology, and intent to bring about this change, and capital. But for each of these companies, the concept of a driverless car seems to vary. So how would you define it? An autonomous, fully functional self-driving vehicle? Semi-autonomous, with a smart driving assistant (for the rare times the owner would be driving)? Would you feel comfortable being driven around without having anyone in the driver’s seat? It really does vary. I, for instance, would feel fine. The software and hardware being used would have gone through countless checks – from both the private firm and the government – and there would be laws in place to complement this. Others, may not share this view. Many of you would probably know that a lot of the companies that are going to be discussed have tested their cars on roads, and most have been (almost entirely) successful too. So why don’t they move into mass-production? Money surely cannot be limiting them. So what’s holding them back? I think they are just waiting for their system to be flawless, to make sure no one gets hurt – and there are two different paths being taken to explore this.

How These 20 Companies are Tackling the Driverless Future Head On The Establishment. If one had to, two broad sets of players can be defined. The first set consists of those who are continuously and incrementally improving their technology (sensors, and the sorts) and software (response time, assisting features, etc.). Notable names would be Daimler (the company behind Mercedez Benz), Volvo (with its DriveMe programme , and its partnership with Uber), BMW and Toyota . All these are current car manufacturers. Lets call them The New Age. This group has members such as The second group is trying to pioneer a new form of driving all together. We’ll call these. This group has members such as Google Tesla (despite being a among the top three car manufacturers in all of America, Tesla has chosen to take a radical approach to tackling the driverless future), Apple General Motors (partnered with Lyft) and PSA Groupe (the second largest car manufacturer in Europe). Ford is a bit hard to place. Its approach seems to be a blend of that of The Establishment and The New Age. (A complete list of companies and their different approaches is available at the end of the article. With it, you will get a document in which I have evaluated all the twenty companies’ cars on certain parameters and given my verdict on them.) A few features already in play are: forward and backward collision warning, lane departure warning, parallel park (automatic or assisted), automatic reverse parking and a lot more. BMW has a car which can park itself and can come to pick you up – all without any human interference! All of Tesla’s latest cars have all the required hardware needed to complement the driverless software. Once it’s perfected, Tesla merely needs to push out this software to every interested customer, and hey presto! Google’s Waymo has driven 1.8 million miles in testing. Others too have tested quite a lot, but nothing as impressive as Google – they did start the earliest.

But different ethos drive every player! Uber wants to build a fleet of driverless cars to retain its aggregator platform without having to share the revenue with anyone (drivers). Ford seems to want to come into the same space too, with their cars being targeted at the ride-sharing, or hailing service industry. Ford & GM are working towards to ensure they remain in the transportation business and the likes of Google and Apple have a complete different dream and vision for the technology driven world! Rolling out an electric version, BMW is looking to make driving both more safe, and more eco-friendly. Daimler is working on something that no one else is (details for which can be found in the bonus section below) and in my opinion is going to be one of the most successful in the space.
