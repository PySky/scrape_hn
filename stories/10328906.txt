 

 I recently tripped across a comment on Hacker News that inspired me to ask a question there about 1-3 person shops with profitable web businesses of some kind. I don't really mean consultants who happen to also have a website listing their services. I mean a webcomic, blog, SAAS model, app or other web business that makes enough money to support the 1-3 people who work on it. My question only got one reply and that did not even list any specific examples.

So I thought I would list the ones I happen to know. This list is in no particular order. I have not researched it or fact checked it. It is information "off the top of my head." Inclusion on this list should not be interpreted as a personal endorsement. It just means I am aware of their existence. If you aren't on it, it isn't a slight. I just either am not aware that you qualify or did not think of you as I dashed it off on a lazy Sunday.

 





 

 

 You can also discuss it on HN. If you have a bicycle on the information super highway, I would love to hear from you. You can leave a comment below to add yourself to the list, or email me if you don't want it publicized here. It would be great if you could link to the business. I am also interested in additional info, like your blog address, HN handle or Twitter handle. I would be thrilled to hear a few words about your business, what you do, how you made it work, or that sort of thing.

These are additional webcomics that I know of that currently do or did at one time support their author:|||
