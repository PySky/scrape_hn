Today, Google Cloud is excited to announce a Machine Learning Startup Competition in collaboration with venture capital firms Data Collective and Emergence Capital.

Startups are eager to use machine learning to build new products and services for their customers. As Fei-Fei Li, Chief Scientist for Google Cloud Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, said this week, we want to do everything we can to make sure this technology is broadly available, powerful and simple to use for everyone.

The competition brings together promising early-stage startups using machine learning for an opportunity to receive up to $1M in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credits and the potential to receive up to $1M of equity investment from our partners, Data Collective and Emergence Capital.

Startups invited to participate in our final pitch-off event will also have an opportunity to meet and receive feedback from our supporting partners, a16z, Greylock Partners, GV, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.

In keeping with Google’s spirit of openness, teams don’t need to use GCP to be eligible for the competition. U.S.-based startups working in any sector — from health to financial services and from retail to mobile apps — are encouraged to apply.

Entries are due April 16, 2017. You can find all the details on eligibility, timeline and prizes on our competition website. Applications are open now! We look forward to learning more about your company!
