For noun (plural to singular and singular to plural), verb (gerund, present & past) and adjective (comparative, superlative) transformations.

First of all, unless you have a dictionary of all the words and verbs that exist in English, you can't really write a regular expression or an algorithm and expect to have a 100% success rate. English has been adopting words from a lot of different languages (French, Greek and Latin for example), and each one of these languages has its own rules of pluralization and singularization, let alone verb conjugation.

Even with dictionaries you'll have the problem of complex and made up words like , and you might have to add dictionaries for specialties (like medicine which does actually have its own dictionary).

However, I think what you'll find in this library is what can be achieved with the least amount of compromise.

I've used a set of rules (for detection/transformation) in combination with an exceptions list.

However, testing the library was more challenging than anticipated. If you have any case inaccuracy or false positives please submit an issue.

And of course, You can clone this repository, install and test it for yourself, and you'll see how it passes the 9900 tests successfully.|||
