Apple has seemingly redesigned the logo for Windows 10, an odd move considering the company doesn't control the branding of Microsoft's products.

The change appears on Apple's tech-support website for iCloud Calendar with no explanation for why the standard Windows 10 logo was not used.

Business Insider has reached out to both Apple and Microsoft to ask about why the real Windows 10 logo didn't make it.

The reason is unlikely malicious, however, as the two companies have an increasingly friendly relationship.
