Chances are you’re wearing a smart tracker to record your vital signs right now.

But today scientists are exploring a metric that’s previously been overlooked, which could have a huge impact on your health:

Improving the ways we track this vital sign could change life for all sorts of people: those recovering from illness, those living with longterm health conditions, and elderly users.

That’s because walk speed can predict a huge range of health issues like cognitive decline, falls, cardiac and pulmonary diseases.

Today, devices like Fitbit can only roughly estimate walking speed based on step count, and GPS trackers don’t work inside buildings. So one MIT lab created a new device to rival the leading trackers on the ‘wearable’ scene. And it isn’t a wearable at all.|||
