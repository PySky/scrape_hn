There seems to be a common belief about computer science: people either get it, or don't get it.

A recent paper by the University of Toronto, Evidence That Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal, dispels such myth.

The paper even suggests some explanations for this myth: teaching failure. We don't know how to teach computer science; so, it seems that some people succeed at learning despite teachers' inability to convey CS concepts.

I think the idea is interesting and very appropriate; I have some opinions of mine:

Otherwise, we risk an even further split between practitioners, those that learn by doing and that sometimes don't have a formal education, and the academics, that live in the walled garden of universities and have little to no contact with the industry.|||
