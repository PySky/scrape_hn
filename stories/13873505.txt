To a great extent. The CEO of a company owns the company’s culture, and the head of a company’s engineering organization owns the engineering culture of the company.

In Uber’s case, it is Thuan who owns Uber’s engineering culture. Uber’s culture became toxic over time under his reign. I don’t really think Thuan is by nature a bad person. He seemed genuinely care about employees and Uber’s engineering culture. He gave pretty good speech too. However, what he has done was detrimental to Uber. Generalization is cheap, so let’s get into specifics.

Hopefully, Susan’s blog post will catalyze some positive changes. It will be hard as Uber has already grown to thousands of engineers, but at least it’s worth trying.|||
