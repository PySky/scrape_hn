Last month I had written a tutorial on the subject of containerizing a web application that talks to Couchbase Server.  This tutorial called, Deploy a Node.js with Couchbase Web Application as Docker Containers, helped you containerize a Node.js application, but this time around I figured it would be helpful to have a step by step video to avoid having any loose ends in the process.

The video below is a complete walkthrough on the process and can be applied on any Mac, Linux, or Windows machine that is running Docker.

If you need help with containerizing a Couchbase Server NoSQL cluster, check out a previous tutorial I wrote titled, Using Couchbase with Docker and Deploying a Containerized NoSQL Cluster.

To find more information on Couchbase, Docker, and any of the development SDKs, check out the Couchbase Developer Portal.|||
