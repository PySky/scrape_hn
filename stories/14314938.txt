TED is one of the world's premier cultural events, providing not just a chance for the thousand or so attendees to hear from some of the smartest people around, but also opening up this knowledge to millions of learners around the world through the event's wildly popular online videos.

But those aren't the only ways the much-buzzed-about conference promises to expand intellects and spur fresh thinking. The event's world-class speakers also regularly recommend books for further reading from the stage, and this year's event, held recently in Vancouver, British Columbia, was no exception.

The big brains on show suggested an incredible number of titles, all of which were helpfully rounded up by ParrotRead (hat tip to Kottke). Here's a small fraction of the truly gargantuan list to get you started. Load up those shelves or e-readers with everything from history to poetry to sports memoirs and you're all set for summer.|||
