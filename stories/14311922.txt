With an HD display, a Kaby Lake CPU, and a sizable solid-state drive, this laptop offers a complete computing experience wherever you go.

Inside, this model features a seventh generation dual-core 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U CPU, integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, 8GB of DDR4 RAM (2400MHz), a 512GB SSD, a DVD burner, Bluetooth 4.0, and 802.11b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi support. As for the 15.6-inch display, it has an HD resolution of 1366×768 and LED backlighting.

Even if you typically lean towards desktop PCs, there’s still a lot to love here. The built-in touchpad is large and precise, the chassis is durable, and it even sports a number pad on the right-hand side of the keyboard. And since it has a built-in HDMI 1.4 port, you can easily plug into your monitor or HDTV.
