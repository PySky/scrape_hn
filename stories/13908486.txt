The day I actually became a product manager

We’d just closed our Series A round. We were twenty people and I’d been an engineer for two years before I became the first product manager in the company.

I got the job for a couple of reasons. First, I always had strong opinions on the product and experience and often argued with the CEO (who was the product guy) on product decisions. Second, I always wanted to try out product management and so when he announced his plan to formalize product and hire a product manager I said I’d like to do it. He trusted me and thought I had good product instincts so he let me have it.

The first few months were great. We had a good roadmap and were growing fast. He was doing biz dev and I was driving product. But then things started slowing down, our user growth stalled. That’s when our problems began.

He was back on product and started driving it in a different direction. He overruled my decisions. He made a lot of phone calls to users and those discussions influenced him more than the data. He wanted to move fast and cut corners. That made me nervous, but it was his baby so I played along.

The next few months were really bad for me, I didn’t get why we were doing what we were doing. I wasn’t happy with the way we were hacking the code to make it work differently. I felt like I had no say in anything.

Remarkably, the new experience started resonating and growth started to come back. Turns out he had this vision as a plan B since day one. His bet paid off. Not only that, had we continued in the original course, we could have ran out of money and failed. I stayed through it for over a year and quit.|||
