I love my career in Security. I found it to be the perfect combination of mathematics and computer science. I worked as a security software developer at Canadian Security Establishment(CSE) for a year as an intern and spent 8 years working on the team responsible for securing BlackBerries. I now lead a team of developers who build the Arctic Wolf Cyber SOC that our Security Engineers use to keep our clients networks secure.

While completing my undergraduate degree in mathematics I took a job working at CSE as a cryptographer where I helped a team evaluate Bluetooth as a cryptographic algorithm. I enjoyed it and came back another term, except to a different team. Our job was to help the canadian government retrieve important information.

Those experiences where enough to convince me I wanted a career in security and at the time the really good jobs needed a master’s degree to attain. So off to the University of Waterloo I went to get a degree in cryptography!

My degree and previous job experience landed me a job as a Security Software Developer at BlackBerry and the rest, they say, is history!

There are many many ways to get into security. It really depends on what type of security you are interested in. Once you know that you can start doing some research.
