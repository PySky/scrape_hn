I’ve chosen one of the apartment stairwells to remake, primarily just because I wanted to try making a small environment getting out of my usual sci-fi comfort zone, and I wanted to attempt to make a scene entirely using Substance Designer and Painter. I’m also going to expand this scene into an exterior too as that will be good fun! I’m not giving myself any time limit on this scene, I just want to have fun with it in my spare time.

So far, I’ve only used Photoshop for a few little decals on the paint cans and fizzy drink cans. Everything here so far has been textured in Substance Designer so far. However, I’ve started to use Substance Painter and I’m thinking of switching my material library over to Painter to start getting some more unique detail in there!|||

Creative Assembly environment artist Liam Tart is currently working on an amazing personal remake of Half-Life 2 scene in Unreal Engine and it looks amazing.
