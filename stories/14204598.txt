We’re excited to announce the availability of the IT pro technical documentation for Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on docs.microsoft.com. As part of this release, we’ve also migrated the technical documentation for Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Windows Store for Business, Education, Surface, Surface Hub, and HoloLens.
