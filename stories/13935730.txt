After installing the libc6_2. 19-0ubuntu6. 10_amd64_ udeb package during the automated install of ubuntu 14.04.5, the system was suddenly unable to resolve hostnames via dns. Installing -0ubuntu6.9 resolved the issue. Reinstalling -ubuntu6.10 broke the system again.

I note that -ubuntu6.10 was recently added to the archive.

I am currently unable to install Ubuntu 14.04.5.|||
