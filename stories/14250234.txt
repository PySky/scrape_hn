Some of the workmates who attended to PyConES went to a talk about Micropython and discovered that there is a thing named ESP8266 NodeMCU which is a small wireless micro-board which can be programmed in Micropython and it is very cheap (you can find it any Chinese marketplace from prices below 3€). The ESP8266 it's very popular in the IoT enviroment because it provides a wireless device out of the box. In fact the microcontroller is the wireless chipset itself! Take a look how simple it is to send a data via POST with Micropython.



How do we know if the toilet is in use? Since our toilets are only suitable for one person if there is light in the room it means that there it's occupied by somebody. Easy, isn't it? So we need a light sensor: a LDR. Those are a cheap and simple components to detect light. Its output resistance value depends of the amount of light that they receive. We followed this basic approach to connect the LDR to the board.

Then we needed a case to protect the board and place it in a good place of the bathroom. So we downloaded a PCB case printable 3D model in thingverse and modified to fit the dimensions of the PCB and the NodeMCU. We printed the case thanks our friend Marcos.

On the other hand, we need to show the status of the toilet in a website to easily view if the toilet is free or not. So we built a simple Django app with the brand new websockets frameworks Channels. With a few lines the site renders almost in real-time when somebody enters and leaves a toilet.|||
