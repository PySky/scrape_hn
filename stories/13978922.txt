Remember that weirdly realistic episode where the protagonists would toil away on electricity-generating bikes ? While the prospect of becoming simply a tool for creating electricity is terrifying, we were so intrigued by the idea of playing a video game at the gym that we turned it into reality. Gymgaming is a mobile video game that you can play on exercise bikes and ellipticals, and its available on the App Store today: Download Gymgaming Now.

Using the front-facing camera of your phone and kinect-like algorithms for camera vision, Gymgaming can detect how fast you are cycling.

Simply try and cycle at the same speed as the green zone. You win points for staying inside the zone. If you stay long enough, you complete a streak and points start accumulating at a faster rate.

Gymgaming is as much a game as it is a workout. Each level is divided into different intervals, each with it’s a different target speed and resistance.

Gymgaming does not require any external accessory and it will work on any exercise bike, even on this 1955 Vintage Exercycle Executive.|||
