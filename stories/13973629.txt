Us: Wouldn’t it be cool if people could post messages around the real world, but virtually?

People: You mean like comments?

Us: Yea, they could be comments, but also stickers and photos.

People: You mean like Snapchat or iMessage?

Us: Yea… but this is different, this is using live augmented reality — you can put stickers, text, animated GIFs and photos on things at places in the real world. And then others can see them when they view the virtual spaces in the app.

People: Oh, augmented reality…. like Pokémon Go*?

Us: Sigh, yea, but these are virtual 360° spaces that you create and add things to - they can be seen by everyone or maybe just your friends… kind of like a virtual graffiti wall that others can write on, too.

People: OK, sounds cool, but why would I do it?

Us: Well, if you wanted to express yourself or make a statement at a particular place — like leaving your photo to say “I was here!” at a cool landmark, or sharing what you think about a restaurant or trolling your friends with a GIF at school.

People: OK… I’m not sure I’d do any of those things.

The above wasn’t an actual conversation, and I promise not the way that we conducted qualitative interviews. It represents what it was like to get iterative feedback for an app that we launched in 2016 called Outta.|||
