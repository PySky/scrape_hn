Cargo cult programming is a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose. Cargo cult programming is typically symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug they were attempting to solve or the apparent solution .[1] The term cargo cult programmer may apply when an unskilled or novice computer programmer copies some program code from one place to another with little or no understanding of how it works or whether it is required in its new position.
