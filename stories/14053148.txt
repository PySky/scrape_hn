Anyone can make CampFire Flame. The schematics, code, STL CAD files, and links to supplies are all available on Instructables. CampFire Flame was created through the innovative use of common prototyping methods, all on free software like Sketch-up and Arduino Processing. The code is easy to manipulate to make new and improved light patterns, interactions, and experiences.|||
