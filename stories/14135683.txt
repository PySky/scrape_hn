Bring industry and academia together to have a conversation.

One speaker addressing hundreds of people is hardly a conversation.

Chess-timer talks are our unusual solution to making tech conferences a more interactive, more fun, and better place for learning and discussions. 



 Speakers who choose to give a chess-timer talk are allowed 20 minutes of solo speaking time, and 20 minutes of discussion time. A Curry On representative operates a chess-timer during the presentation, switching between solo + discussion time budgets. When an audience member interrupts the talk to ask a question, for example, we switch the timer to deduct from discussion time. 



 Curry On will feature a limited number of chess-timer sessions, meaning that a majority of talks will still be standard conference talks.|||
