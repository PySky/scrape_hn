So there’s this secret thing I’ve been secretly working on for the past few weeks and it was a secret. But then today I guess some parts of the secret thing that was secret were leaked and now it’s not really a secret anymore.

It’s a really extremely cool company and I can’t wait to tell you about it. I was given the lowdown about it earlier this month and have been rapid-fire learning ever since. Turns out the brain is obnoxiously not simple. But don’t worry, there’s a deadline.

In the meantime, here’s the thorough blog series I wrote about Elon’s other companies:
