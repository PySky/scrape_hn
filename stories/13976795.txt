Not all code bootcamps are created equal. We're seeing an alarming number of students apply to Lambda School after dropping tens of thousands on bootcamps that—frankly—failed them.

For reputable code bootcamps this shouldn't be an option (which is why we rolled out our tuition reimbursement program for all full-time Lambda School students). But not everyone was afforded the same opportunity.

We're so confident we can get you a job that for those students who have attended a code bootcamp there is no up-front tuition. Instead, attend Lambda School for free, and only once you graduate and are employed as a full-time web developer you'll pay us 10% of your first year's pre-tax salary in twelve monthly payments. That's it.

If you, somehow, are unable to find a job after Lambda School, enjoy the 100% free education (though we expect you to keep trying for at least one year).

Our end goal is to provide everyone with a risk-free education. We're not there yet, but you can know that we're doing everything we can to rapidly work toward that goal.

Offer only available to students who attended a full-time bootcamp that lasted 12 weeks or longer. Students must be looking for employment in the United States. Full terms and conditions forthcoming.|||
