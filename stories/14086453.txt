First, airlines are required to do everything they can to ensure “the smallest practicable number of persons holding confirmed reservation space” are kicked off a flight against their will. In a situation where there aren’t enough people willing to volunteer, federal regulations state that airlines must have a seating priority policy “written in such manner as to be understandable and meaningful to the average passenger” laying out how they choose which paying customers will be removed from a flight.

Airlines must make sure that their priority boarding policy “shall not make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or subject any particular person to any unjust or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.”

Examples of factors that can make you higher or lower on the boarding priority list, per the CFR, are the time a passenger checked in, whether a passenger had a seat assignment before arriving at the gate, the fare they paid, their frequent-flyer status, and if the passenger is disabled or is traveling as an unaccompanied minor.

It gets more complicated from there, but in certain situations, federal regulations state that passengers who are kicked off flights can be entitled to 200%–400% of their fare.|||
