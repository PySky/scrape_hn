Google is opening up its Classroom educational service to allow anyone to create and teach a class on its platform.

The web-based tool works across devices and Google says it can be used to help manage classes for adult education, hobbies, and after school programs.

Classroom should come in handy for people who want to do more than just post tutorials on their blogs and YouTube channels; they can add resources, post tasks and assignments and interact with students as they progress through lessons.

This is the second major update to Classroom in 2017: last month, Google expanded the service to allow anyone to join classes, without the need for a G Suite for Education account (which is usually made available by schools and universities to their students).

You can get started setting up your own class over on this page, and learn more about Classroom here.
