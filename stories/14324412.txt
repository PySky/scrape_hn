Urban Armor Gear, a case manufacturer for cell phones and other mobile devices, may have let the cat out of the bag about the rumored 10.5-inch iPad Pro. An Apple Authorized Retailer’s stock system shared with 9to5 Mac seems to show a UAG Metropolis Folio case ‘for iPad 10.5-inch’ with availability listed for June.

After Apple skipped the iPad event this spring, it seems WWDC is the logical choice for when and where we’ll hear the announcement. WWDC starts June 5, and following other Apple typical release schedule, it should be available within two weeks of the event’s conclusion.

That said, this is by no means a certainty. As Ben Lovejoy points out:

Of course, case manufacturers are also some of the most reliable tools at our disposal to confirm links, as they often get information as to the size and specs of devices before it’s made public. But as always, take leaks and rumors with a grain of salt.
