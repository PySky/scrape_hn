Take a couple of minutes to explore what makes mini.css different from all those other CSS frameworks and UI toolkits.

mini.css is a lot lighter than a lot of other full-featured CSS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, Semantic UI), but it is not a micro framework (e.g. Milligram, Pure.CSS). Instead, mini.css blurs the line between full-featured and micro frameworks by providing lots of modules and components in a very small file. All the things you expect to find in a CSS framework, such as grids, styling for common elements and typography, along with some more complex components such as tabs or cards are all present in mini.css.

Many CSS frameworks utilize modules to deliver more components and features, without making it necessary for all developers to include them. mini.css provides a handful of very powerful modules that can do many different things. This way, developers only have to learn a few different HTML structures and patterns, while having the ability to build a lot of interesting things with them. You can see an overview of the modules below:

mini.css allows you to easily customize your designs, using Flavors, pre-built color and style variants of the framework. The functionality is the same, but many things like color palettes, spacing and fonts can be easily changed by the community. Apart from that, you can easily build your own flavor by tweaking variables and using mixins, as explained in depth in the customization section.|||
