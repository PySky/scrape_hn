On 30 March 2017, EPSRC will be holding an event to launch the new 'Tier 2' layer of High Performance Computing (HPC) equipment. These new computers will be funded through a Â£20 million grant awarded to the Universities of Bristol, Loughborough, Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, and UCL. Professor Simon McIntosh-Smith from the University of Bristol writes about 'Isambard' - Bristol's new supercomputer which hopes to change the landscape of HPC.
