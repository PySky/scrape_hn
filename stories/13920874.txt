If you use bricks as dominoes: you get a second wave going in the opposite direction.

I think that is the original upload. If anyone finds a better one, please do let me know.

CORRECTIONS

- The overlap length should be 21 - √(21² - 6²) = 0.875 cm not the incorrect √(21² + 6²) - 21 = 0.84 cm I show on-screen. First spotted by Daryl Adriano.

- A correction to my masonry terminology! What I called the width is actually the height of a brick (which makes sense given the orientation bricks are normally laid). The width is the third dimension: how far into the wall they reach. Thanks to Doodle Vids.

- Let me know if you spot anything else!
