I’ve literally watched the beloved series, Mad Men, 5 times. It’s easily my favorite period-show of all time and any entrepreneur should do themselves a favor and watch it (if not for the amazing cinematography and wardrobe selections).

Several business related themes always pop out at me:

Never be afraid to invent or reinvent yourself.

The founding team portrayed in Mad Men has had to start and restart many times throughout the series, much like startups and their pivots of today. Aspiring entrepreneurs need to embrace change when they’re faced with it.

Opportunities are created and reserved only for those who’re prepared.

The main character of Mad Men, Don Draper, is a self-made man in the most literal sense of the word. Don was never satisfied with the status-quo, always looking out to get to 100%. Even with his flaws, Don is a meticulous preparer, thinker, and strategist. Business owners can learn a thing or two about the way Don thinks.

People join and leave Don’s advertising agency throughout the series but only a handful of people are truly trusted and given the opportunity to grow and come along for a new venture. Not only do the people you surround yourself with need to be talented but also have a strong sense of moral character. They are the centerpieces of your business culture.

Growth culture is important and the people you lead need to know

Your team needs to know there is room for them to grow and thrive in a chosen career. The prime example is Don’s previous secretary, Peggy Olson, turned Senior Copy Writer. Business owners need to establish and grow a culture of self worth and taking initiative in order to grow that worth. It’s a win-win for everyone.|||
