Migrating your project off of Xervo

Zeit ‘Now’ is a platform which has similarities that developers have enjoyed on our service in addition to many other great features such as auto scaling, backups, custom domains, deployments directly from GitHub repositories, and multi-region support at the enterprise level.

The pricing for ‘Now’ is great also, with a free tier, and a ‘premiere tier’ at $15 / month.

 

 The Zeit team has also set-up a special #xervo channel in their Public Slack Community where members of the Zeit team will be on hand to answer migration-related questions.

 

 In addition to our doc here, the Zeit team has also created the following migration guides:

Make sure you are using the latest Xervo CLI

The project download command from the CLI will save your project source in the directory that you are currently operating from within your terminal.

 

 xervo project download --output myProject.zip



 Or specifying a specific project name:

Please note, you must specify the output file name (with the --output flag) and it must end with the .zip extension.

Update your Xervo CLI if not already on v7.1.3

Export your env variables for the specified project

In this particular example the environment variables for my project “meteorHello” will be exported into a .json file in the directory that you are currently operating within your terminal or command line interface.

Meteor can also be deployed to Now by using a third party module: 'meteor-now.'

 Meteor-now is explained here: https://github.com/jkrup/meteor-now

 This is not recommended for production Meteor applications|||
