Think the rainbow and unicorn food trend is going away anytime soon? Think again. From rainbow grilled cheese sandwiches to unicorn hot chocolate, this magical culinary club has another member: the Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino.

The rumors about the Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino first started spreading earlier this month, but now the coffee chain confirmed to TODAY Food that it's serving this once secret-menu item from April 19 to 23.

So what's in this magical looking drink?

The base is a crème Frappuccino with mango syrup that's mixed with a sweet pink powder. Then it's blended together and poured into a cup that has a layer of sour blue syrup. The finishing touches are vanilla whipped cream and a sprinkle of sweet pink and sour blue topping.

The drink changes color and flavors as it's swirled, according to Starbucks. At first the Unicorn Frappuccino looks like it's purple with swirls of blue. But once it's stirred, "the color transforms from purple to pink, and the flavor evolves from sweet and fruity to tangy and tart. The more swirling, the more the beverage magically transforms!" Here at TODAY Food, we found that the color change was very subtle and not as drastic as we expected.

TODAY's editors tasted the drink and agreed that the flavor tasted like an orange Creamsicle with touch of tanginess. Anyone who loves sour candy will like it — you know who you are.
