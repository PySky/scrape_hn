EasyStaticSite is a static site generator that is dead-simple to install and use: Just download and run it, and it will open a browser-based admin section. Written in Python, it has no dependencies other than the Python interpreter already installed on your system (if you use OS X or Linux), and its admin section has no external JavaScript dependencies, meaning you can use it offline.

Before checking out this list, please take a look at the template - it is fairly self-explanatory.

Sure. EasyStaticSite only writes .html files, so files with any other extension are okay. In case you need to manually place a .html file there, just make sure it doesn't have the same name as one of the post/page slugs.

EasyStaticSite has no interface for that, so you will have to manually copy the image(s) to the document root (~/easystaticsite/web) and then, when editing a post/page, select the HTML editing tab and insert an tag in the code.|||
