Theoretical modelling with simulation is done on a berration. Mono wavelength optical rays

are treated with marginal and paraxial consideratio ns under ideally normalized conditions for

real image plane curvatures. Implications of d irectional cosines and position coor dinates on

geometric stability of rays suggest a new appr oach to study aberration. Para-marginal angular

ratio is investigated as an important parameter for longitudinal aberration and coma

between focal length change x and longitudinal ab errration x in paper, authors
