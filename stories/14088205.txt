People use Facebook to discover and connect with communities in meaningful ways. One way people are forming and strengthening communities is through Facebook Groups. Whether connecting with other fishermen in your town to share tips, organizing a get together for new parents in your neighborhood or finding others dealing with the same medical condition, people use Facebook Groups to connect in personal, practical and powerful ways.

No matter your interests or personal circumstance, there’s probably a group out there for you. In fact, there are tens of millions of active groups on Facebook, and every one of them exists because of the passion and dedication of the group admins who lead these communities. Mark Zuckerberg wrote about the important role that group admins play in his letter to the Facebook community earlier this year.

To celebrate these community builders, we will host our first-ever Facebook Communities Summit on June 22 and 23 in Chicago. The event is an opportunity for a few hundred group admins to gather, share and connect in real life.

We’d love to host each and every admin on Facebook, but space is limited. Admins are invited to apply here for a spot at Facebook Communities Summit. Stay tuned for more event information in the coming weeks.|||
