When you try to transfer some DJI 4K files from cards to iPad, the iPad may shows the video, but it probably says wrong format for playback. So, what caused the problem? Based on my experience, it was probably caused by the high bitrate and resolution of the DJI 4K footage. What I need to do is to reduce the 4K file size by lowering the bitrate and resolution. Below is how to.
