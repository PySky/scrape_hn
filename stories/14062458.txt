Today, I realized the power of consultative sales. I have sold to hundreds of clients in the past few years. I always believed in helping a client more than achieving my quota to make commission.

I recently quit my sales job at Freshdesk and start my own consulting firm. A client from a leading brand reached out to me personally to tell me, how much they miss working with me.

SaaS consulting is not about you or the service, itâ€™s about your client and the problem they are looking to solve. Personal connections never fade.
