As most other smartphones get bigger, a new phone is headed in the opposite direction.

Called Jelly, the tiny 4G smartphone is one of the world's smallest. Seriously, it's itsy-bitsy.

Jelly has a 2.45-inch display, and is about 3.6 inches tall and about 1.7 inches wide. Despite its small size, Jelly works like any other smartphone: It runs a version of Android Nougat, which is only a year old, and is compatible with 4G wireless networks.

Jelly is an update to a tiny phone that launched in 2015 called the Posh Micro, a similar mini-phone that came in bright colors like magenta. But Jelly has more RAM, dual SIM card slots, more battery capacity, and is available in white, black, and sky blue.

Jelly will officially launch on Kickstarter on May 2 and will cost $59, but we got our hands on one a few weeks early. Take a look at this little phone:|||

This tiny 4G smartphone works the same as any other Android phone, just miniaturized.
