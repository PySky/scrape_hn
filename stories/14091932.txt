Ying won a reward for this innovative application. His son is shown cutting out one of the disks.

Note: The scale identifiers (A, B, C, S, T, etc.) are added to every scale at the half interval marks (an unusual visual technique, but very effective). In this way, the scales are identifed no matter where the rule is positioned.



 Peter Monta made this scale sheet using a 'C' file to create a postscript file of Otis King Model L scales. to fit rigid tubing. Directions:

 Cut out the pieces using the trim lines. A paper trimmer is recommended, but scissors may be used if the trim lines are joined by pencil and straightedge, then carefully cut inside the line so no pencil shows in the final article.

 Wrap the lower scale and upper scale into cylinders and secure along the seam with transparent tape (the matte-surface 3M Magic tape works well). The tape should go on the outside of the upper scale and on the inside of the lower scale, so that when they are telescoped there will be a smooth, paper-to-paper sliding action. Make sure the small tick marks keep their uniform spacing across the seam---gaps or overlaps will degrade the ruleÂ’s accuracy.

 Telescope the upper scale into the lower scale. The lower scale is horizontally stretched by 1.2 percent to allow this to happen (this value is appropriate to the thickness of ordinary laser printer paper). Wrap the cursor around the assembly. Aim for a slightly looser fit than the two main tubes, then tape. There is no harm in an overlapped joint for this part, and it is much easier to make and adjust. Set or read the scales from directly above, not from an angle. The cursor mark rides slightly above the upper scale, so parallax must be eliminated for best accuracy.

In the first column is the scale name. In the second column is the formula used for that scale. Any simplification is left as an exercise for the reader. The convention used is that R denote the length of the rule and # denotes the number on the scale whose position is being calculated. The final column contains notes about the particular scale.

Derivation of the scales was not always easy, and I have not shown here how it was done. Essentially, I went in knowing that the whole thing was based on logarithms, and then played around until I came up with something that worked. Generally I started out quite close -- it became mainly a matter of playing with constants. Jason.|||
