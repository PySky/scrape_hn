Contrast Assess produces a continuous stream of accurate vulnerability information whenever and wherever software is run. Development, QA and Security teams get results as they develop and test software, enabling them to find and fix security flaws early in the software lifecycle, when they are easiest and cheapest to remediate.|||

That's the bottom line with Contrast Assess: It gets better results. Just imagine if 99% of all false positives could be eliminated, while catching more than previous SAST & DAST tools ever could.
