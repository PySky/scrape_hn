Spotify, the ever-popular music streaming service, almost needs no introduction. Since the company's founding in 2006, Spotify has 50 million subscribers listening to their extensive and continously growing catalogue.

However, many people don't realize that the company has a local office in Somerville with 90+ employees.  Back in 2014, Spotify acquired The Echo Nest, a music intelligence and data platform company that was born out of the MIT Media Lab.

A lot of the consumer facing recommendation and discovery features on Spotify are built out of this office. For example, if you've ever listened Discover Weekly or Your Daily Mix, the team in Somerville powers Spotify's ability to create these personalized playlists based on your listening behavior.

I've been a long time Spotify subscriber and I'm like a kid in a candy story browsing through an endless catalogue of tunes.  So, I was looking forward to visiting their offices.  Needless to say, it did not disappoint.

Album art covers some of the walls with legendary recordings from Led Zeppelin, Beastie Boys, and The Clash.  All the conference rooms are named after local venues, like the Paradise Rock Club. The open meeting / kitchen area has a DJ booth and a stage with drums and guitars.

Then... there was the music playing in the background from their own inhouse playlist called Prosecco where employees are continuously adding in songs.  I got to hear two of my all time favorites - Photograph by Def Leppard and Take a Picture by Filter.
