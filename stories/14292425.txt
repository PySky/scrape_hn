“Don’t let the fox guard the henhouse,” the old adage goes. But for our bug bounty program, we’ve flipped this conventional wisdom on its head to yield some strong results for the security of our online properties.

Since its inception three years ago, our bug bounty program has increasingly helped to harden the security of our products. Over this short period, we’ve received thousands of submissions, and, as of December 2016, the bounties awarded for reports that resulted in real bug fixes has now surpassed a total of $2 million. Just last month, a security researcher helped us identify and patch a vulnerability in Flickr.

In 2016 alone, we awarded nearly 200 researchers around the world. These bounties helped to fix vulnerabilities of varying severity across our web properties. Most bounties accounted for less impactful vulnerabilities, but some were more substantial.

Yes, this all comes with a degree of vulnerability. After all, we’re asking some of the world’s best hackers to seek out soft spots in our defenses. But it’s acceptable risk. The right incentives combined with some hackers who actually want to do some good has resulted in a diverse and growing global community of contributors to our security. Currently, our bug bounty program sees more than 2,000 contributors from more than 80 countries.

In 2017, we’ll look to continue to foster this healthy marriage in security. Attracting the highest skilled hackers to our program with meaningful bounties will continue to result in impactful bug reporting.|||
