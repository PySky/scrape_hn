On this episode of Igniton presented by TireRack.com , we take a look at Porsche’s latest version of its Boxster roadster, the 718. This moniker comes from a successful convertible and mid-engine’d race car from the late ’50s. The implication for the new Boxster is a clear focus on performance, but there’s one other thing: Much like the original racecar, the new 718 Boxster S has a flat-four cylinder.

What does that mean for the pure driving thrill associated with roadsters?|||
