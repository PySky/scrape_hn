Lexus UK unveiled a cardboard, origami-inspired, replica of its IS sedan made from "1,700 fully recyclable laser-cut cardboard sheets" and powered by an electric motor. It took three months for a team of designers from the UK laser-cutting service LaserCut Works, 3D model maker Scales and Models, and packaging company DS Smith, to handcraft this full-size model. Plus the glue they used took 10 minutes to dry, so "accuracy was vital, as changes couldnâ€™t be made once the glue had dried," according to a news release. The car will be shown off at the home improvement show Grand Designs Live at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre, starting Thursday.|||
