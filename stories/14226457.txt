Shimo is based on the latest security technology available. Your privacy and the security of your data is protected when using Shimo to establish network connections. We make no compromises when it comes to security standards.

Shimo provides encryption technology such as AES-256 which is even certified by governmental organizations, global enterprises and the military. But encryption is only as strong as its weakest link. As a consequence, our hash algorithms include SHA-2, the latest set of cryptographic hash functions. Additionally, secure cryptographic key exchange over insecure or public channels is enabled using the Diffie-Hellman (D-H) method.

Likewise, passwords are often not sufficient to introduce security to a system. If your connection requires certificates or one-time passcode tokens, such as RSA SecurID, our VPN client for Mac provides the necessary toolset through Extended Authentication (XAUTH).|||
