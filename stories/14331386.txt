On Friday 12th May 2017, a ransom-ware called WannaCry infected machines in 70+ countries — including telco companies like Telefonica in Spain, or healthcare authority like the NHS in England — and the number of infected machines keeps growing.

This ransom-ware supports 28 different languages, encrypts 179 different type of files and requires victims to wire money ($300-$600) over bitcoins in order to get the control back of their machines.

It is believed the ransom-ware used an SMB vulnerability patched by Microsoft (MS17–010) in March. A public exploit for this vulnerability had been released in April by a group subbed as ShadowBrokers while leaking files containing offensive tools belonging to the NSA including a remote SMB exploit called ETERNALBLUE which affects the above vulnerability.

This vulnerability is believed to have been used by the NSA to take over their targets including the backbone of financial institutions in the Middle East.

Thanks to Darien Huss for highlighting the binary that infects the system, Zammis Clark wrote a good write-up on the infection part and the domain name that was register as part of a kill switch for the malware.

Below is the most interesting discovery form Darien Huss, which enabled @MalwareTechBlog to register the domain name to prevent further infection — for now. Although, it is important to note that:|||
