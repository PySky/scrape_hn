U.S. stocks rebounded after the first 1 percent decline since October, while havens from Treasuries to the yen remained in demand as investors assessed the prospects for pro-growth policies in America.

The S&P 500 Index edged higher, while technology-heavy measures posted solid advances. Banks slipped to an eight-week low after bearing the brunt of Tuesday’s rout. Treasury 10-year yields fell to 2.40 percent, the yen surged versus all its G-10 peers and gold rose toward $1,250 an ounce. Bloomberg’s dollar measure fell a sixth day, its longest slump since November. New Zealand’s central bank held its benchmark rate steady.

The gains in U.S. equities provided a measure of calm to the market, though havens remained in demand a day before a Republican health-care bill is set for a vote in Congress. Lawmakers have signaled any setback could delay enactment of tax cuts and spending increases, the prospects for which have underpinned the rally in risk assets since Donald Trump’s election. The depth of selling Tuesday drew some investors back in on speculation the drop went too far given data showing strength in the global economy.

“Everyone has been waiting for a dip for so long that when you get some kind of a dip, for not just tech but large-cap value too, it’s one of those opportunities to buy in,” said Mariann Montagne, a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments LLC, which oversees about $1.4 billion. “Maybe people are seeing a cue that things aren’t deteriorating across tech land. The deterioration of tech wasn’t due to fundamentals, it was just a function of pricing.”
