(seventh RacketCon) is a public meeting for everyone interested in Racket: developers, contributors, programmers, educators, and bystanders. Itâ€™s an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to share plans, ideas, and enthusiasm. RacketCon will enable the entire Racket community to mingle: to update each other, to exchange ideas, to collaborate, and to help shape the future of Racket.

Registration is not open yet. Stay tuned!

RacketCon attendees benefit from a group rate at the Hotel Deca near the venue.
