Planning to integrate YouTube videos to your application? This post is for you. I will show how to retrieve YouTube videos from YouTube playlist using YouTube API.

In order to use YouTube API, you need to create or obtain API Key. By using this key, you can make YouTube Data API requests. I will be using PHP to fetch videos and display in the webpage.

Note down this API key and lets start fetching YouTube data.

To retrieve Playlist videos, we need API key as well as YouTube Playlist ID. We can find YouTube Playlist Id simply by clicking the Playlist link in YouTube. The URL of that page contains Playlist Id. The following PHP code makes API request to fetch playlist videos from YouTube. Data fetched from YouTube is in JSON format.

We can list videos fetched from above code in our webpage. Hereâ€™s a sample implementation.

In this way, we can integrate YouTube playlist to our webpage using YouTube API v3. There are lot of features that can be integrated by using YouTube Data API. We can use the API to upload videos, manage playlists and subscriptions, update channel settings, and more. Google Developer page for YouTube is nice resource to further explore these features.|||
