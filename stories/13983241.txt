Starting today, you can stop worrying about missing live moments on stream when you use the new “Auto” quality option to watch streams.

The Auto setting helps reduce video interruptions by automatically switching your video quality to the highest level your bandwidth can support. When your internet connection slows down, you’ll see a change in video quality instead of buffering or stalling that takes you away from the action. In the video player Options menu, you’ll still see the quality option that has been selected, so savvy users can still find that information when needed.

The Auto setting is part of our ongoing work to improve video quality on Twitch. From expanding access to quality options to 10x more streamers, to our initial tests with streaming 1080p, 60fps video from events like TwitchCon and The International, we want to make sure that however you connect to Twitch, you have a great viewing experience.

We’re rolling out the Auto option starting today, and it will be available in the video player options menu for all users in the coming weeks.|||
