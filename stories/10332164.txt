The Container vs VM debate has been a pertinent question for years, but with the recent popularity of Docker, many have been keenly anticipating VMware's response. Their CEO's early claim was that Containers and VMs are "better together", but what exactly does that mean? Should we run containers in VMs, instead of VMs or even as VMs? In answer to this, Ben Corrie has spent the last year researching the most efficient way to run Containers directly on VMware's hypervisor and recently announced Project Bonneville. In this talk, Ben will take you under the covers of Bonneville to look at questions such as; how you can have a shared Linux kernel where every Container is privileged; how you can have containers without any Linux at all; and how VMware has brought dynamic resource constraints to the notion of a container host.|||
