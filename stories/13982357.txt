Our efforts to expand the power and capability of users of Platform.sh continues! The latest addition to our services suite is Influx DB 1.2. Influx DB is a time-series database well suited to recording large volumes of data over time. That makes it a good choice for high-volume logging, data collection, and metrics.

In fact, we are planning to use it ourselves for that last point. Stay tuned…

How can you use it? Same as any other service, really. Add the following to your   file:

And on next deploy you have an InfluxDB service running, named  , with 1 GB of space reserved for it. (Add gigs as needed…)

Have a look at our documentation for more, and at the InfluxDB documentation for what cool things you can do with it. (And let us know what you do with it! We’re always curious to see what neat things our customers come up with.)|||
