Backup is a system utility for Linux and Mac OS X, distributed as a RubyGem, that allows you to easily perform backup operations. It provides an elegant DSL in Ruby for modeling your backups. Backup has built-in support for various databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It was built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.

Please use the Backup features issue tracker to suggest new features. Only use the Backup gem issue tracker for bugs and other issues. We're also available on Gitter for questions and problems.
