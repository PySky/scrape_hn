Q: Er, isn't that what blinds are for?

A: Yup, in theory. Except for that time of day when the sun hits your window at just the wrong angle, and you might as well just have your light on. Also, ever tried taking blinds with you on a trip?

Q: Who can wear these?

A: We're launching with three versions: a six hour version for adults, a two hour version for babies taking naps, and a six month version for light-sensitive hibernating bears.

Q: Can't I just wear a sleep mask?

A: Sure. Until you wake up a few hours later with it half strangling you, stretched across your nose and your mouth.

Q: Do I need a prescription?

A: Nope! Unlike normal contacts, which are a regulated medical product, you won't need an eye test or prescription for these. And it costs us far less to make them as we don't have to do quite as much testing, so they'll be cheaper!

Q: How safe are these lenses?

A: Pretty safe!1 Mostly they're just like normal contacts. The data from our initial trials suggests that the quantities of mercury in the 'blackout' nanotubes released into the bloodstream when the lenses dissolve are really quite small, and result in at most a 7.5% reduction in life expectancy2, and is unlikely3 to cause long-term blindness.

3Fewer than 1 in 3 mice suffered from long-term blindness after using the product. Results in humans may differ.
