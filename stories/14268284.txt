is an open source (MIT), cross-platform toolchain for building and packaging C++ code. It includes the build system ( ), package manager ( ), and repository web interface ( ). There is also , a public repository of open source C++ packages.

The aim of the project is a modern build system and package manager for the C++ language that provide a consistent, out of the box interface across platforms/compilers. Having a sane build file syntax would be nice, too. The toolchain is written in C++14 and while not strictly C++-specific, that's the primary focus.
