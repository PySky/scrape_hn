At the recently held Currency and e-Payment Forum held in Casablanca, Morocco, it was revealed by René Tano, an executive at BICICI which is a subsidiary of BNP Paribas, that Côte D’Ivoire processes $28 million (17 billion CFA francs) in mobile money transactions daily.

Tano was a speaker at the 5th edition of the forum which focuses on digital technology in the currency and payments space, and organized by VISA and Interworld.

According to Tano, these numbers are based on statistics obtained from the telecommunications regulator in Cote d’Ivoire, ARTCI. The total number of daily mobile money transactions accounts for all transactions (transfers, deposits, bill payments) of Orange, MTN and Moov which are the three telecom companies operating in the West African country.|||
