As in the Linux world, where there are several prominent distros like Mint, Debian, and Manjaro, in the Smalltalk world, there are several prominent Smalltalks. We shall take a brief look at them…

Pharo: the most actively developing Smalltalk with the largest user community. It’s the foundation for Seaside, a fantastic web framework. Also, see PharoJS for the web.

Squeak: a popular Smalltalk for educational purposes and hobbyists. I’ll give an honourable mention here to Cuis Smalltalk, a Squeak derivative that isn’t exactly prominent but it has many fine qualities.

Dolphin Smalltalk: Smalltalk for Windows (giving you Windows’ look and feel). It has a highly lauded IDE.

Amber: Smalltalk for the web. Who needs JavaScript and React?!

Redline Smalltalk: Smalltalk on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The JVM is probably the most important runtime environment in computing history (billions of devices worldwide run on it).
