I prefer home-cooked meals over going out to eat. It's easier to save money and much easier to stay on top of your health if you do it right.

The thing is doing it right can mean a fair amount of work every week. Even then, you can find yourself eating the same dish over and over.

My goal is for EatHow to make it easier for you to cook at home while keeping meals interesting, healthy and in-budget.|||
