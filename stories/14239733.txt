In Spring 2007, Facebook introduced its first public API. Almost everyone started using it to build web apps, but I wanted to try and do something interesting that used the power of the native Mac environment.

I ended up very quickly putting together this screen saver which pulled photos and metadata from the service.

I used a combination of Quartz Composer patches to render everything along with a light Cocoa bridge to set everything up and talk to Facebook's servers.

It got some nice bits of press from Mashable, Adweek, and some job offers, but API changes eventually got in its way.

A lot has changed in the past decade. At the time this came out, the original iPhone had not even shipped, and the smartphone revolution was still a hypothetical.

I loved using Quartz Composer for prototyping interactive visuals, and used it for a number of projects afterward, but what's interesting is that it appears that Facebook did too.

The designers at Facebook loved Quartz Composer so much that they built a whole toolchain of patches around it called Origami to use for UI/UX prototyping in 2013. They've since invested quite a bit further into it.

I'm more likely to use a tool like Unity3D for UI / UX graphics prototyping these days, but it's interesting to think back to hacking in the early days of the Facebook API, and unintentionally stumbling onto a technology combination that Facebook would later embrace for their mobile apps.|||
