View All the ISO 7000 / IEC 60417 Graphical Symbols for Use on Equipment

After our recent blog Why the Power Symbol Looks the Way It Does we went down the rabbit hole of looking for more symbols and stumbled upon this online catalog of all the graphic symbols from ISO 7000 / IEC 60417 standards:

From heavy machinery operating symbols to the numerous and varied laundry icons to the hair-grabbing “what does that icon mean?” icons you see on multi-function printers and scanners, the symbols are viewable for free and downloadable – for a price – in a multitude of formats.

This collection includes both ISO and IEC graphical symbols that can be placed on equipment to indicate how to use it correctly and safely. It includes symbols for all types of equipment, from automobiles and home entertainment products to earth-moving machinery.
