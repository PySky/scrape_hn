The Safeweb Engine is built upon a container based architecture which enables you to support to millions of simultaneous browsing events. Compared to appliance and virtualization based models, containers are significantly more scalable and efficient at scale.

The Safeweb Engine physically isolates web browsing into disposable containers hosted on a physically isolated server. The web browsing activity of each browser tab is isolated into its own individual disposable container for maximum isolation security.

The Safeweb Engine is the only cybersecurity platform with a container based architecture designed for cost effective scaling. The container based architecture allows you to cost effectively isolate millions of browsers using commodity cloud servers.

The Safeweb Engine was developed in collaboration with cybersecurity teams at the NNSA's Sandia National Laboratory. We built the Safeweb Engine for the National Nuclear Security Administration to protect the US nuclear arsenal and laboratories.|||
