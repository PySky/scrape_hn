It’s your yearly scrapping mission, but this year is different. Your humble scout ship has been recruited to join the massive spacecraft ICARUS. They plan to head to far edge of the galaxy, to a remote sector where other scrappers have not yet dared to venture.



The rewards could be unimaginable. But so are the risks. It may be unexplored space, but it’s a gamble you know you must take.



You return from a run empty handed, but worse, ICARUS is no where to be found. You check your coordinates. You try the coms. No answer from your comrades on ICARUS. Yet their teleporter appears in-range and responsive.

So you grab a gun “just in case” and teleport onto ICARUS. What could go wrong?|||
