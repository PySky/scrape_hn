Microsoft bought the task management app Wunderlist back in 2015, and today the company has released the first public preview of its eventual replacement called To-Do. Microsoft’s new To-Do app is available to try on iPhone now, and preview versions for iPad and Mac will soon follow.

Microsoft says the Wunderlist team has built-in intelligent suggestion features and integrated the new service with Office 365:

To-Do is built on Office 365, which in coming months will enable the product to be even more useful in more places. Our first integration with Outlook makes it easy to stay on top of your Outlook Tasks from anywhere. It will automatically sync your Tasks with To-Do, and allow you to access and manage them across devices.

Wunderlist users won’t need to switch just yet, but Microsoft already has an importer so users can migrate to the new app now:

Once we are confident that we have incorporated the best of Wunderlist into To-Do, we will retire Wunderlist. While the name and icon may change, the team that brought you Wunderlist continues on. We look forward to making To-Do even more useful, intuitive and personal.

You can download Microsoft To-Do for iPhone for free on the App Store. To-Do preview is also available on Android, Windows 10, and the web from today.|||
