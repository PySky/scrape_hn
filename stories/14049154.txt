DevOps, for most of the tech audience, is still a confusing term. It is evolving and is going to evolve even more in the days to come. I will leave the definition to yourself, but I can tell you what DevOps is not and some misconceptions around it.

Is â€˜DevOpsâ€™ really making an impact on the software powered firms? Have you seen the number of searches on the internet for this term by the CTOâ€™s and geeks around the world?

You have to care because one or the other day you are going to say, â€˜Letâ€™s Do This.â€™ I am sure you will say it.

No, you have mistaken. DevOps has come a long way, and itâ€™s not a trend anymore. In fact, many experts are describing it becoming the mainstream in the software development process.

DevOps is not about automating everything. It is making sure that mundane and repetitive tasks are eliminated and automated so that the cost will reduce drastically.

This is not any set of tools, or you donâ€™t have to image every developer tool whenever you see this word â€˜DevOps.â€™ It is a cultural shift that involves processes and workflows, But to do it, you need some set of tools at each stage.

Of course, DevOps speeds up the processes and makes sure your product delivers to the market quickly, but it is not only speed, but it is also stability and quality. It is making sure your product performs the way it is meant to till it reaches the end customer/client.

DevOps is not for everyone. Well, why? It depends on many facts,

> Culture followed before and carried by the top management

DevOps is not any team; it is a term we use to define a cultural shift and applies to the entire organization and every individual, hence we say it is a cultural change.

This is not only about Dev and Ops in the organization. It carries a holistic approach of refining the processes across the organization. DevOps is making sure every developer in the team has the same guidelines. For example, it can be the set of tools to use across the entire organization.

These are some of the biggest misconceptions people have and let me know if I have missed any.
