Don't spend a long time arguing about these. Because they are so subjective and not likely to cause or reduce bugs one way or the other, nobody should get bent out of shape if their preference is not chosen by the team. Give everyone two minutes to make their case for their favorite, have a vote, majority wins, end of discussion. Use an existing tool (astyle, autopep8, an emacs mode, whatever is available for the language) to help people follow these rules.|||
