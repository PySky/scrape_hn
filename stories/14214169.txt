There is a wide range of factors that can explain military spending in Europe. This includes perceptions of the world being an uncertain place in general, European states being involved in wars in the Middle East, the use of the military against violent extremists and possibly also the arms industry’s efforts to sell its products.

However, the growing tension between Russia and most of the rest of Europe is often mentioned as a particularly important reason for the recent trend of increasing military expenditure in Europe.

Russia’s military spending in 2016 was $69.2 billion, an increase of 87% since 2007. The increased spending is a heavy burden on its economy, which is in serious trouble due to low oil and gas prices. Russia has used its increased military spending to modernize its armed forces and use them in the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

NATO is an organization built up of 25 European countries plus the USA, Canada and Turkey. These countries work together on military matters and have agreed that an attack against one or several NATO members is considered to be an attack against all NATO members.

Together, NATO members spent over 12 times more on the military in 2016 than Russia. Together, the European NATO members spent over 3 times more on the military in 2016 than Russia.

The figures on military spending in Europe do not tell the whole story because they do not show what actual military capability is generated by the spending or how this capability can be used in different contexts.

For example, several NATO members deploy their military throughout the world and not just in Europe, and Russia is still rebuilding its armed forces after years of decay. However, the data helps to raise questions about threat perceptions and the policies that states develop to deal with them.|||
