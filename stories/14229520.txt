represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Methods are provided to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation. The result can only be retrieved using methodwhen the computation has completed, blocking if necessary until it is ready. Cancellation is performed by themethod. Additional methods are provided to determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled. If you would like to use afor the sake of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can declare types of the formand returnas a result of the underlying task.

Sample Usage (Note that the following classes are all made-up.)

The class is an implementation ofthat implements, and so may be executed by an. For example, the above construction withcould be replaced by:

Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation happen-before actions following the corresponding in another thread.|||
