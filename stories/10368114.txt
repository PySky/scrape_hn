Plumbum (latin for lead) is a port of Michael Snoyman's excellent library.

It allows for production, transformation, and consumption of streams of data in constant memory. It can be used for processing files, dealing with network interfaces, or parsing structured data in an event-driven manner.

There are three main concepts:

In order to combine these different components, we have connecting and fusing. The method will combine a and , feeding the values produced by the former into the latter, and producing a final result. Fusion, on the other hand, will take two components and generate a new component. For example, fusing a and together into a new , will consume the same values as the original and produce the same result as the original .

There are four core primitives:|||
