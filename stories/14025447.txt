Last week when writing about the release schedule for GNOME 3.26 , one of the first questions was about what features are coming to this next installment of the GNOME desktop.While the GNOME 3.26 development cycle is still very young, below is a look at some of the features being talked about for GNOME 3.26. The list was made by looking at various individual program roadmaps, developer blogs, and more. The list is far from extensive and some of these items may not end up getting completed in time for the September debut of GNOME 3.26, but as of now this is a look at what's planned.
