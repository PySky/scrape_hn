ShapeShift, a cryptocurrency exchange that makes it possible to swap any one of dozens of digital tokens for any other, has raised $10.4 million in a Series A round led by Berlin-based Earlybird Venture Capital.

The funds will be used to expand ShapeShiftâ€™s team and release two "groundbreaking" new products this year, the startup said in a news release on Wednesday.|||

The exchange, founded by a bitcoin pioneer in 2014, is facilitating more than $50 million worth of transactions each month, as the &quot;gold rush&quot; in blockchain-based assets takes hold.
