Where is the mastodon site, and how was it found?

Wait, the site was found in 1992 and excavated in 1993 ... why is it only being announced now?

OK. What’s the new evidence being presented?

Sounds intriguing! Why are other experts so skeptical?

Are there any other concerns about the tools?

If the stones are tools, though, does that cinch the case for humans?

Well, that sounds more promising! So if the authors are right, is it possible I’m related to these ancient mastodon miners?

How would any of these species have made the crossing?

Have claims for sites this early been made before?

Can the researchers do anything else to back up their claim?|||

A new study has dropped a bombshell on archaeology, claiming signs of human activity in the Americas far earlier than thought.
