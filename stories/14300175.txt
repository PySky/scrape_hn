I started the project just for kicks, but now it seems like there are a few shortcomings of the vault API that can be fixed through a UI.

HashiCorp recommends root tokens to be revoked ASAP. But there's no easy way to find out whether a system has any lingering root tokens. So I added the functionality to crawl through all tokens for a string/regex match. There's no easy way to find a list of all policies that have access to a certain secret path. So I added that functionality too. As a vault system grows, its list of policies will grow too. And eventually, house cleaning needs to be done. But it's next to impossible to find out if removing a policy will destroy functionality (e.g. if current tokens still use it). This is on my to-do list. Policy changes and mount tuning requires a quorum of unseal tokens, but the process is extremely manual. Another thing on my to-do list is to add a policy/mount request & approval process, and allow approval by providing unseal tokens. Root token will be created and revoked immediately after the change.

The project is still quite crude, so feedback is very welcome. If you want to encourage further development, a star for the repo would be appreciated

EDIT: By the number of stars I received, it seems like people are interested to see where this project goes. I'll certainly keep working on it. I updated the previously obscure deployment instructions. Thanks for the support!|||
