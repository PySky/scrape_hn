Bol.com is the largest e-commerce site in the Netherlands. They just recently celebrated 18 years in business. This is also the age where you can legally drive on your own in the Netherlands (and most European countries.) So naturally, marrying the two seemed like a fun concept. bol.com celebrated its 18th year birthday to go for a spin. Following a creative concept by Buutvrij and LEWIS, bol.com asked Dutch designers Ionie Chamilaki and Titia Dane from design studio I O I A and free hand builder Joost de Boer of Entrepreneur collective Schaalwerk, to make a car from scratch. And though bol.com sells more than 15 million products, cars don't happen to be one of those products.

The designers made the car from 223 items available at bol.com including a dog strap as seat belt, a grill plate for the car grill and spatulas as pedals. it took them 420 hours to complete the car. But it is electric and fully operational.

 The car is 1.47 meters wide, 2.72 meters tall and weighs only 322.59 kilograms. If you're thinking, man I wish I could get one of these cool cars, have no fear. If you are a DIY kind of person you can order the package from Bol.com and build one yourself. Too bad it doesn't come with an instruction manual.

 Fun idea either way.|||
