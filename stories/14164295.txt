On Friday, April 28th 2017, Canonical is ending official support for Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases)

As we use Ubuntu Precise 12.04 as our default base image for our builds, we wanted to let you know what this means for Travis CI build environments.

All builds using Precise 12.04 after April 28th, the EOL date, will be working as usual. For those using the default container-based Precise 12.04 images: everything will continue as it is. There will be apt repo URL changes upstream at Canonical for Precise 12.04 and this will be updated in travis-build to continue fetching precise apt-packages during build time. images will be getting one last round of service and distribution updates, and will be available long-term as-is. These updates are already available and are tagged with , and will be promoted to stable on May, 3rd 2017. We will retain the previous as following this update. For those who need kernel-specific or dist-specific precise, we recommend specifying in your file. This will move your builds to using fully virtualized machines, using our images.

We’re focusing on making the switch to our default stable image from Ubuntu Precise 12.04 to Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 in early Q3, sometime in July. We will begin to communicate more details about the change soon.

If you’d like to go ahead and start testing how Ubuntu Trusty would work for you, feel free to specify directly in your file.

Of course, if you have any further questions about this, we’ll be at support@travis-ci.com to help you out.|||
