Early in summer 2016, the so-called Islamic State set fire to one of Iraqâ€™s largest oil fields.

It has taken Iraqi firefighters 10 months to put the flames out.

The smoke has poisoned the air, the land, and the water across a vast region of Northern Iraq.

Photos from the charity Oxfam reveal how difficult life has been for the people of Qayyarah, since the Islamic State group fled their town.|||
