Alright, so today I wrote a response to an email I got from mig, and while writing it, I figured it might be a interesting read for other people too, although it’s basically a huge rant.

 If you cannot stomach the use of the f-word, do NOT read on.

So here is what I wrote and then sent to mig and a few other people with similar questions and also a bunch of mozilla mailing lists.

 Please note that it was not about changing minds (I given up on that quite some time ago), but more of a cathartic exercise collecting and writing “away” my frustrations.|||
