Juicero is offering all of its customers the option to return their juicer for a full refund within the next 30 days, even if they bought it as far back as when the product launched a year ago.

The offer comes after Bloomberg published a story yesterday pointing out that the packs of pre-cut fruits and vegetables that Juicero’s very expensive juicer was designed to press don’t actually need to be placed in the juicer — it turns out, they can be squeezed by hand.

While Juicero’s product was always going to be unnecessary insofar as it was a ridiculous, Wi-Fi-connected, luxury juicer, the fact that it isn’t even needed to create the juice makes the product truly unnecessary.

Juicero’s CEO, Jeff Dunn, who over took the position in November, posted a response on Medium today arguing that “The value of Juicero is more than a glass of cold-pressed juice. Much more.”

He goes on to outline two scenarios where Juicero would be valuable. One involves someone drinking juice, the other involves someone getting a notification to remind them to drink juice before their juice packs expire and their internet-connected juicer refuses to press them.

To prove that Juicero isn’t just selling packages of juice, and is really putting fruits and vegetables in its packages, Dunn also posted this video of what it looks like when you tear into one:|||
