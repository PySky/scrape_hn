Containers are immensely popular in the cloud world. With Clear Containers we're working on a way to improve security of containers by using Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT).

We set out to build Clear Containers by leveraging the isolation of virtual-machine technology along with the deployment benefits of containers. As part of this, we let go of the "generic PC hardware" notion traditionally associated with virtual machines; we're not going to pretend to be a standard PC that is compatible with just about any OS on the planet. Why? By shedding the legacy baggage, our model provides a dramatically improved experience: it’s slimmer, simpler, safer, and a lot speedier!

Key ingredients in the Clear Container model are:

Combined, these features improve the resource utilization efficiency significantly.  The launch times are so fast that a typical user would hardly be able to see the difference. Clear Containers offer enhanced security with speeds vastly superior to traditional VM technologies.
