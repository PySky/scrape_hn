It’s important to seek knowledge every day and learn from other people’s lessons and experiences. The startups and tech world is changing at a pace we have never witnessed before, and unless you keep yourself knowledgeable and informed, your are outdated! Be a lifelong learner, and you will never lose. I have written before about the state of the organisational learning and how broken it is, maybe it’s worth checking.

What forced me to start working on Knowledge Officer, is that I knew we deserve something better than the crap being pushed into our faces every day from clickbait, ads-driven or “viral” content. I believed and still do, that good quality content does not have to be viral and does not have to be fresh, and I believed we need “Knowledge” more than “News”.

I learnt from thousands of people whom I have been reading what they have written and taking notes over the years and I wanted to make sure everyone in the world gets the same experience and not suffer the same suffering.|||
