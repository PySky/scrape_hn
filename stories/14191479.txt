Devart team is glad to announce the release of the updated dbForge Developer Bundle for SQL Server.

We introduced a new mechanism that activates the Developer Bundle tools (does not apply to free tools). The new activation process protects you against potential piracy and provides you with the reassurance that you are using an authentic product that can be trusted with your business data.

Also, with greatly improved visual style, all tools of the bundle look as great as never before.

For complete lists of new features and improvements for every tool, see the following pages:
