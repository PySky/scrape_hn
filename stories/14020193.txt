Requests is the only Non-GMO HTTP library for Python, safe for human consumption.

Warning: Recreational use of the Python standard library for HTTP may result in dangerous side-effects, including: security vulnerabilities, verbose code, reinventing the wheel, constantly reading documentation, depression, headaches, or even death.

Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, powered by urllib3, which is embedded within Requests.

Reddit, The NSA, Her Majesty's Government, Amazon, Google, Twilio, Runscope, Mozilla, Heroku, PayPal, NPR, Obama for America, Transifex, Native Instruments, The Washington Post, Twitter, SoundCloud, Kippt, Sony, and Federal U.S. Institutions that prefer to be unnamed claim to use Requests internally. Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the right level of abstraction. I'm going to get `@kennethreitz <https://twitter.com/kennethreitz>`_'s Python requests module tattooed on my body, somehow. The whole thing. Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to `@kennethreitz <https://twitter.com/kennethreitz>`_'s request library. Today has been AWESOME. Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful, simple, Pythonic. Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000 downloads every month. All the cool kids are doing it!|||
