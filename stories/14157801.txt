TL;DR: We invite you to join us for a Mastodon-exclusive week! Starting this Monday, 2017-04-24 at 0:00 UTC, log out of all your Twitter clients, and don’t log back in for a week.

You might have heard of the Mastodon social network, it’s an open-source, decentralized, community-built alternative to Twitter. You have 500 characters per post, no ads, and many instances explicitly ban discrimination and harassment. Its mascot is a woolly, mammoth-like animal, and instead of tweets you write toots! We think that’s cute. And by now, the network consists of more than 1000 independent active instances with over 400,000 registered accounts!

In our experience, a hard cut works best for trying out new platforms like this. Some of us have made exceptionally good experiences with such a Mastodon-exclusive week. On the one hand, you will get to know Mastodon inside-out during this week, and on the other, it might convince your Twitter friends to come with you! Maybe some of them even already have Mastodon accounts? You can find them using the Mastodon Bridge.

This is a list of Mastodon members who will participate in the #woollyweek. Want to join us? Ping @blinry to be added to the list! We’re looking forward to have you with us!
