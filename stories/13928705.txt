The price for an unlocked (suitable for any carriers) model is set to be CAD 999, which fairly matches-up with the $749 that is, the amount given for the HTC U Ultra in the US.

The customers can also purchase, a pair of JBL Reflect Aware C headphones along with the phone, for CAD 134.99 as a promotional price, which is only half of its original price (CAD 269.99). These headphones are available in White and Black colors and be connected via USB Type-C port of the U Ultra.
