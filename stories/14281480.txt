The Q&A begins. Fortune’s Carol Loomis asks a question on behalf of an unidentified shareholder concerned about the sales practices scandal at Wells Fargo. The bank’s decentralized plan was blamed in large part for the breakdown and the shareholder wants to know if Berkshire is vulnerable to same thing given its decentralized structure.

Buffett said he reiterates to managers near and far that reputation is crucial via regular missives. Basically, he’s saying an ethical corporate culture is more important than thousands of pages of guidebooks.

At Wells Fargo there were three very significant mistakes, he says, but the biggest problem was the bank’s incentive system. “Clearly at Wells Fargo there was an incentive system built around the process of cross-selling” and services per customer, he notes.

“It turned out that was incentivizing the wrong kind of behavior,” Buffett says. All companies can struggle with such issues, but the CEO should get wind of the problem and act.

At Berkshire, Buffett says a hotline is his best source of information. Most complaints are frivolous “but there are a few serious ones” that are examined by the firm’s internal auditors. Most are referred back to the subsidiary company but Buffett says he hears about the serious ones and they take steps to root out “practices we wouldn’t condone at the parent company.”

As for Wells Fargo, Buffett says he doesn’t know what their system was, but “it was a huge, huge error if they were getting some communications and they ignored them.”|||
