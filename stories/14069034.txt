According to the myth, there are engineers who can contribute 10X more than their peers. I don’t know whether this is possible or not, and I haven’t got a good metric for productivity (right now!). But I would like to improve my productivity by finding a way to measure and drive self-improvement over the next year.

If I’m a median engineer at Microsoft, then I’m looking to have 2.5X more impact by this time next year.

Step one: Finding an initial metric to judge impact.

Number of tasks completed seems like the least flawed metric. I believe it might be a blend of all 3 and more…

Step two: Finding out how I work

Initial theory, if I can track how I spend my time I will be able to optimize it to be more productive.

Data I might be able to collect

Slightly less on topic but maybe correlated

Task: time to start writing services to collect as many data points as possible!|||
