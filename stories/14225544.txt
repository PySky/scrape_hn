We are excited to announce the release of Scala.js 0.6.16!

This release is mostly a bug-fix release. It also adds support for jsdom v10.x (which contains breaking changes wrt. jsdom v9.x) and Scala 2.13.0-M1.

Read on for more details.

If you are new to Scala.js, head over to the tutorial.

If upgrading from Scala.js 0.6.14 or earlier, make sure to read the release notes of 0.6.15, which contain important migration information.

As a minor release, 0.6.16 is backward source and binary compatible with previous releases in the 0.6.x series. Libraries compiled with earlier versions can be used with 0.6.16 without change. It is also forward binary compatible with 0.6.15, but not with earlier releases: libraries compiled with 0.6.16 cannot be used by projects using 0.6.{0-14}.

Please report any issues on GitHub.
