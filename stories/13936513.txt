This film, meant to be shown to high school students, uses the device of "computer vs. human" in the comparing of their thinking abilities, told through animation and live action. The animation is Jetsonian, the concepts a little ahead of their time.



Though it's no Watson vs. Humans a la the 2011 Jeopardy! event (or even a Deep Blue vs. Kasparov contest), the basic principles in the film are still applicable today, even though much more sophisticated computer/software systems exist.



Audience: high school students

Produced by Bell Labs Film Unit
