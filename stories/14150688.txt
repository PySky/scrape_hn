Uber has always maintained that drivers, which set their own hours and must provide their own car and fuel, are self-employed, with the app merely a platform for linking drivers and passengers.

Last September’s ruling, sought by two drivers supported by the GMB Union, was seen as a major blow to Uber, whose business model relies on treating drivers as self-employed. It was also seen as having wider implications for the gig economy, in which workers rent out their time instead of being treated as employees.

An Uber spokesman said: “Almost all taxi and private hire drivers in the UK have been self-employed for decades and with Uber they have more control over what they do. Licensed drivers who use our app are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts, minimum hours or uniforms.|||

Uber has been granted an appeal against a landmark ruling that declared its drivers qualify for basic employment rights.
