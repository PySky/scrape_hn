Sunita Kaur, managing director, Asia from Spotify joined us for a conversation to discuss the music streaming service and its footprint in Asia. We discuss the current state of Spotify and its value proposition to the customers and the artistes, the specific challenges that Spotify faced to expand their footprint in Asia, and how the service has to localise and customise their service for the Asian markets from Japan to Hong Kong. Last but not least, we reflected on how digital media has evolved over the past decade and why digital text, audio and video content have evolved differently with different business models.



Here are the interesting show notes and links to the discussion (with timestamps included):
