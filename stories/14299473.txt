In this blog post I will focus on Android BankBot and mainly I would like to update this blog post with new derivatives of BankBot including C&C’s, number of bots, APK samples or hashes, distribution vector if possible, targeted countries, targeted banking or financial institution apps or added new functionality.

If you come across a new variant of Android BankBot and you don’t mind to share, feel free to let me know at Lukas and I will update this blog post with your catch and particular acknowledgement.

Feel free to share it between Android security researchers to contribute.

Simply to spread awareness including infiltration details between security researchers, AV malware analyst or maybe even potential victims. Share malicious samples, URL’s and C&C’s to blacklist and of course to take down these botnets.|||
