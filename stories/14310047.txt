Today we are extremely excited to announce that the PowerShell extension for Visual Studio Code has reached version 1.0! We are shipping this update to line up with the PowerShell Core 6.0 Beta.1 release to provide the official PowerShell development experience for all supported platforms:

We’ve been working hard over the last year and a half to put together a first-class development experience for PowerShell that includes the following features:

You can find instructions for installing VS Code and the PowerShell extension at our GitHub repo.

You can also watch these YouTube video for an overview of using the PowerShell extension and Visual Studio Code (warning, loud audio at the beginning of the first video):

As you probably have already discovered, the PowerShell Team has shifted to an open-source development model for the majority of our projects. This has enabled us to move extremely quickly, responding to customer feedback by releasing updates on a regular basis. Our focus now is on delivering value and quality quickly and incrementally rather than spending months polishing a single version for release.

With that in mind, we have a bit more flexibility on what it means to ship a 1.0 release of our tools. In the case of the PowerShell extension, increasing the version to 1.0 indicates a few things:

Originally we were planning to release a series of beta releases similar to those of PowerShell Core before finalizing our 1.0 release. It turns out that the Visual Studio Marketplace currently does not support pre-release version names like 1.0.0-beta.1, so the clearest option was to continue forward with 1.0 so that we can indicate our level of committment and support of the extension.

We’ve got a lot of great improvements planned for the PowerShell extension, many of which will be coming online within the next few releases.

The PowerShell ISE has been the official editor for PowerShell throughout most of the history of Windows PowerShell. Now with the advent of the cross-platform PowerShell Core, we need a new official editor that’s available across all supported OS platforms and versions. Visual Studio Code is now that editor and the majority of our effort will be focused there.

However, the PowerShell ISE will remain in Windows supporting Windows PowerShell with no plans to remove it. We will consider investing effort there in the future if there is a high demand for it, but for now we think that we will be able to provide the best possible experience to the PowerShell community through Visual Studio Code.

We’ve been receiving a lot of great feedback from the community over the last couple of years which has helped us to prioritize our efforts and deliver a great development experience for everyone. Please feel free to give us your feedback and feature requests at our GitHub repo and click “Watch” to keep up to date with the latest developments.

Thanks a lot for your continued feedback and support, we couldn’t do it without you!|||
