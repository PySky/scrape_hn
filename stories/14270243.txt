In this session, you'll learn how to convert an existing Web application that relies only on plain JSON responses into one that relies primarily on hypermedia information in the returned content. In the process you'll see how you can eliminate code from the client -- code that produces tight coupling with the service. In a series of simple review and refactoring, you'll learn how to move specific knowledge of 1) addresses, 2) inputs, and 3) workflow out of the client app and place it into the message. As a result, you'll have a more robust, adaptable, and resilient client that will reduce the need to versioning and repeated redeployment. This session offers valuable lessons and advice for front end developers, API service providers, and software architects.|||
