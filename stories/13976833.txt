On April 24, Bryan Charles Szweda, A former St. Jude Medical executive, will be sentenced for swindling the company out of over $140,000 and stealing a copy of the company's strategic plan after he was fired.

According to the complaint, Szweda was fired from his job as VP of operations at St. Jude Medical in September 2014 after the company claims he submitted false expenses and other questionable out-of-pocket expenses going all the way back to September 2010.

On September 8th, 2014 he was put on administrative leave and on September 10, 2014, St. Jude Medical filed a criminal complaint against him.

The brazenness didn't stop there though. After being placed on administrative leave, Swezda copied more than 4,600 electronic files before he left the building, with one of the documents being St. Jude Medical's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.

“Among the files taken by the defendant was (St. Jude Medical’s) 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, which provides a roadmap of SJM’s key research and marketing initiatives and is considered one of the company’s most restricted documents,” an investigator wrote in the criminal complaint.

After being terminated on September 20, 2014, Swezda took a job with an unknowing Edwards Lifesciences but was let go shortly after the story broke.

Per Edwards Lifesciences senior communications director at the time, “Edwards Lifesciences is learning of this matter as it’s been reported in the media today. We take these reports very seriously, and are taking urgent action to investigate this matter.”

He is no longer employed by St. Jude Medical.

On Tuesday March 7, 2017, Swezda pleaded guilty to felony theft by swindle and the other 4 charges were dropped as part of his plea agreement. Actual sentencing will be April 24, 2014.

If the plea agreement is accepted, Szweda won’t serve prison time for the offense as long as he abides by the terms of his probation which will consist of providing 500 hours of community service to low-income people and pay restitution totaling about $117,000.

This story will be updated with the court complaint and sentencing updates as they become available.|||
