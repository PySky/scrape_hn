Exbars is a flexible Handlebars view engine for Express, designed to give developers complete freedom to choose how they want to organize their templates, partials, and helpers.

Your views/ directory will contain four types of files: Layouts, Templates, Partials, and Helpers.

If your views/ directory is somewhere other than the root of your application folder, you need to specify it like this:

Layouts live inside the views/layouts/ directory, they are just a special kind of templates with a {{{body}}} placeholder

Templates are files ending with a '.hbs' extension, with no underscore at the beginning, ex: home.hbs

Each file that starts with an underscore is a partial, ex: _header.hbs, _footer_content.hbs

the code above will look for a partial called _footer_content.hbs in the same folder as template.hbs, if it's not found, it will look under the views/ folder instead. If you want to include a partial from another folder, let's say views/partials/_header.hbs, you need to do something like this:

This code will look for the partial header inside a folder called partials located in the same directory as the view that calls the partial, if it's not found, it will look inside the views/partials/ folder.

Helpers are files that end with '_helper.js', ex: date_helper.js

Helpers must also export themselves so they can be available for use in template:

Notice: your helper name will always be transformed from underscore to camelcase!

You can structure your files anyway you want, depending on your work style and your application logic.

You can put your helpers and partials in their own folder if you don't want them mixed with your templates:
