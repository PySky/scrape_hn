Hugo introduces the powerful and long sought after feature Custom Output Formats; Hugo isn’t just that “static HTML with an added RSS feed” anymore. Say hello to calendars, e-book formats, Google AMP, and JSON search indexes, to name a few ( #2828 ).

This release represents over 180 contributions by over 30 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 1100 stars, 20 new contributors and 5 additional themes.

@bep still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and @moorereason and @bogem for their ongoing contributions.

@bogem has also contributed TOML as an alternative and much simpler format for language/i18n files (#3200). A feature you will appreciate when you start to work on larger translations.

Also, there have been some important updates in the Emacs Org-mode handling: @chaseadamsio has fixed the newline-handling ( #3126 ) and @clockoon has added basic footnote support.

Worth mentioning is also the ongoing work that @rdwatters and @budparr is doing to re-do the gohugo.io site, including a total restructuring and partial rewrite of the documentation. It is getting close to finished, and it looks fantastic!|||
