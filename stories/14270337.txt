The Breath OS is a new GNU/Linux OS built from source codes. It isn't like any other Linux destros because you have 100% control over it.

The Breath OS is still under development before releasing. But here I would like to share that how I made Breath OS step by step.

Breath OS is created from a basic tutorial of LFS 8.0 with Systemd.

But the linuxfromscratch.org doesn't provide a live CD for building LFS anymore after LFS version 6.2 . So I created a new environment for building LFS. You can download my environment and build your system from source codes. It comes along with everything you need for LFS. You can even build the OS without Internet.

I created a Virtual Machine based on Ubuntu16.04 64bit. And I installed all required packages for building LFS. In the Virtual Machine, I attached all and I wrote a tutorial inside of the Virtual Machine. You can use Virtualbox to import it.

This includes all source codes of packages which LFS-8.0-systemd needs. And it comes with a PDF/HTML manual for building your LFS system!

If you can read Chinese, you can visit here to read some of my experiences about building a new OS.

This includes all the tools compiled for building the new OS.

Note: The tools are only for building the OS and they are the base for building a new OS. But it could be deleted after the new OS was built. Compiling all the tools can be very time consuming, you can start from here if you want to save some time.|||
