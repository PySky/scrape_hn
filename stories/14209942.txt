We carry on with the sequel of the Perl Developer Survey results. Have a look or check out Part 1 first.

Q16  Have you ever followed a TDD approach to development?

This question was meant to gauge the way developers work and what kind of processes they use. 58.4% used TDD at one point, while 26.9% never followed the process. 11% of respondents did not know what TDD. The other section, 3.6% came with answers that don’t approve of this process, those who tried it and didn’t like it or the always present “sometimes”.

Q17  What Perl framework do you use?

This question also had a majority in the other section, going beyond the standard options (46%).

Mojolicious had a 24.8% share followed by Dancer with 19.2% and Catalyst with 19.1%.

These are web only frameworks so desktop and mobile developers went for the other option. Almost 100 responses in the other section went with “None”, which is 11.6% of the total responses.

A few mentioned CGI (17), Mason (12), Moose (8)  Plack (8) or in house or proprietary framework.

Q18 What do you use for debugging?

Most of respondents went with the Perl debugger, 33% (275) others answered with print 18% (151), data dumber 6% (51) or Komodo 2% (17). We also had answers that imply that they don’t use any specific tool for this.

Q19 What do you use for caching?

When it comes to caching Memcached came out first with 22% (133) followed by Redis 14.7% (86) and CHI 8.8% (51). 90 respondents, 15.5% opted for “None” and 14 or 2.4% for Varnish. Other solutions include: homegrown tools, Apache2 or squid.

Q20 What do you use for databases?

MySQL is the most used tool for databases with 46% (367) followed by PostgreSQL with 30% (241) and SQLite 15% (119). Oracle was the choice of 11%, (89) of respondents.

Q21 Do you comment your code?

Most respondents, 74.1% comment their code, while only 2% don’t. 21% checked the sometimes option and in the others section, 3.2%, respondents mostly said that they do it rarely or only when it’s really necessary.

Q22 Do you work on new features or maintenance?

We wanted to know where Perl is used on projects, if it’s used to maintain legacy code or to develop new software and features. It turns out, it’s mostly both. 8.2% do work only on new features while only 2.2.% work on just maintenance. The other section responses were in the range of: sysadmin, system architect or other comments related to this topic.

Q23 What kind of apps do you work on?

Web holds a majority with 51.2%,  followed by the other section with 25.6%, where we have various results, like backend, CLI,  batch processing, embedded, sysadmin, server work, scripting, automation, data processing etc.

Desktop comes next with 15.8% and mobile with 7.3%. These last two were quite a surprise.

Cross referencing this question with a previous one (Is Perl 5 your main language?) we noticed that 67% of all respondents who checked desktop use Perl 5 as a main language and 72% of all respondents who checked mobile use Perl as a main language.

This means that 135 developers who use Perl 5 as a main language work in desktop and 65 developers who use Perl 5 as a main language work in mobile.

Perl for desktop is used mostly in very large companies (1000+ bracket) and large companies (100-1000) with locations from all over the world, the U.S is taking the lead with 32% of locations.

Perl for mobile is used in all sorts of companies, almost evened out, with large companies (100-1000 and 1000+) taking the lead. Locations again vary, but around 30% of companies are based in the U.S., 10% in the U.K and the rest throughout the world.

The Perl community questions proved very insightful and again surprising. More respondents, 52.8%, don’t attend Perl conferences, than those who do, 36.4%.

In the other section respondents left answers like : used to, hope to, maybe in the future, only local meetings or workshops etc.

Q25 Are you a part of a Perl Mongers group?

This question followed almost the same pattern as the one before, more respondents, 58.6%, are not part of any Perl Mongers group, than those who are part of a group, 35.7%. The other section brought answers like: irregular attendance, not active local pm. group or just a subscriber.

Q26 Do you contribute to open source?

62.2% of respondents contribute to open source while 32.1% don’t. In the other section we had answers that go in the range of : sometimes, rarely, want to, not yet, occasionally, basically people who don’t commit to this on a regular basis.

Q27 What’s the last Perl event you attended?

46.4% haven’t attended any, in line with the previous question. The most popular (last attended event) was YAPC:NA and YAPC:EU 2016 and overall the most popular type of event was also YAPC (various years). Also, quite a few people marked their last attended event as a Perl workshop. FOSDEM 2017 (Perl dev room) also had a few responses.

Q28 Do you blog about your projects/experiences?

The lack of interest in blogging was confirmed by this question, with 72.1% of respondents choosing No. However 21.3% do blog and in the other section 6.6.%, of respondents said that they: used to blog, sometimes blog, don’t have the time or rarely do it.

Q29 What platform do you use for blogging?

We followed up with asking about the platform people use for blogging and in all fairness, most, 66.6% chose the “I don’t you I don’t blog option”. The other section was the most popular one, most respondents said they have their own website for blogging, 6% (49), or they use Wordpress 1.6% (13) or Blogger 1.2% (10). A few even use Github or Facebook.

The list goes on with blogs.perl.org with 8% and Medium with 1.3%.

Q30 Are you a part of any type of online Perl community?

The yes and no sections are almost identical, 47.9% are part of a Perl online community while 46.1% are not. In the other section respondents gave other options like: following Perl blogs, Reddit threads, IRC, Perl newsletter or other mailing lists.

Q31 Do you plan to move from Perl to another language in the future?

This was one of the most important questions in the survey. 69.4% of respondents chose no, while 30.6% chose yes.

The most popular choices in the yes section are (multiple choices were counted separately):

Python is the most popular choice, followed by Java, Go and Perl6. We also had quite a few responses that didn’t chose a particular language, but made clear that they would go in any direction that would keep them working. Most respondents also made clear that they would “consider” moving to another language, so they are not adamant of doing so. Some would also like to “explore” other languages and maintain a connection to Perl.

81.4% of respondents who consider moving from Perl in the future have more than 5 years of experience, 8.9% are in the 3-5 years of experience bracket and 5.4% in the 1-3 years of experience bracket. 3.9% (10) respondents with less than a year of experience with Perl are also considering a move. Out of these 10, 5 are looking at Python. 2 at Java, 1 at Perl 6, 1 at JavaScript and 1 at Scala, Swift, node.js all while using Perl.

We plan to make this survey a yearly event so make sure you follow us on Twitter and/or Facebook.|||
