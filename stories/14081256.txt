Add jsonapi.org compliant APIs to your Laravel 5 application. Based on the framework agnostic packages neomerx/json-api and cloudcreativity/json-api.

If you've ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON API is your anti-bikeshedding weapon. By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application. Clients built around JSON API are able to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.

For full information on the spec, plus examples, see http://jsonapi.org

We're in the process of adding full documentation to the wiki. We'll also be adding a demo app.

This repository is under development. We have production applications that are using the package and extensive test coverage of these applications.

The reason we have not tagged the package as is because some features require refinement. You'll see from the issues that there are plenty of suggestions from users of the package as to how to improve it. We might therefore need to introduce breaking changes as we work on these improvements.

We are committed to providing upgrade notes on each breaking change as we develop the package.
