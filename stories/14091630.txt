I made Cello as a fun experiment to see what C looks like hacked to its limits. As well as being a powerful library and toolkit, it should be interesting to those who want to explore what is possible in C.

I recommend reading A Fat Pointer Library to get an overview of how Cello works.You can also peek at the source code, which I'm told is fairly readable, or ask me any questions you like via e-mail.

It might be better to try Cello out on a hobby project first. Cello does aim to be production ready, but because it is a hack it has its fair share of oddities and pitfalls, and if you are working in a team, or to a deadline, there is much better tooling, support and community for languages such as C++.

People have experimented with it, but there is no high profile project I know of that uses it. Cello is too big and scary a dependency for new C projects if they want to be portable and easy to maintain.

Yes! That would be great. If you do anything with Cello I'd love to know, you can e-mail me at , or help with the development at the Cello github repo. Contributions are very welcome.
