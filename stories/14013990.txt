Remember that day (August 2, 2016) when Facebook copied Snapchat Stories for the first time and launched Instagram Stories without even coming up with a new name for it? Well, who’s laughing now that Snapchat made its best filter ever available on April Fools Day: Snapchat April Fools’ Instagram filter!

The new Snapchat April Fools’ Instagram filter has an image of Instagram’s interface with a world “Snapchat” at the top. The filter ads a geo tag to it, depending where you are, and has ‘my_mom and 2 others’ and 😂😂😂 comment from the “author” gently pointing out Instagram’s superficial likes feature.

To access the filter, Snapchat users need to take a photo or a video and then swipe right a few times till they see the April Fools’ Day Instagram filter.|||
