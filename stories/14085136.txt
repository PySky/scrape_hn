I've been using Microsoft Visio Professional 2003 for ages now, since it is wonderful and allows me to do everything that I need for designing my solar photovoltaic rooftop designs for our installers and electricians.

I have been able to zoom up to 52000% on my drawings within the program, which was amazing, for the past 4 years of using this program.

Recently my company updated our office servers and our Microsoft programs/ Outlook email were all updated to Microsoft 2016. Anyway, I had to re-download my Visio Professional 2003 program on my computer, since I have the physical CD/case, so it all works now still, but now I can only zoom up 3098%.

I tried looking everywhere online and in the help section on Visio, but there is nothing about how much one can actually zoom in or how to manually change the amount of zooming that one can do.

Q: Any thoughts or help on how i can zoom up to 52000% again?|||
