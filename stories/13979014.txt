Glimmer is one of the fastest DOM rendering engines, delivering exceptional performance for initial renders as well as updates. Architected like a virtual machine (VM), Glimmer compiles your templates into low-level code so it can run as fast as possible—without sacrificing ease of use.

Productive out of the box Don’t waste days getting your application compiling. Glimmer apps are built with Ember CLI, so you get a production-ready build pipeline in seconds. No fussy configuration files needed.

Because Glimmer powers the components in Ember, there’s a battle-tested, full-stack framework waiting for you—if you need it. Just drop your Glimmer components into an Ember app. You won’t need to change a thing.|||
