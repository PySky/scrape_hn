By now the vampire genre has gone round the block a time or two. The rebirth of the blood sucking vampire tale, from lisping comic to vicious killer to consummate lover, to the boy/girl next door and all parts in-between has by now acquired an old been-there persona.

Personally I grew weary of reading the same old, same old story with a plot barely changed here and there because firstly the gore ratio was and is just too much for little sensitive me to bare and since I am really a lover not a fighter kind of person so anything bigger than a drop of blood has my nearest and dearest pulling out the smelling salts.

I stumbled upon Tanya Huff by chance. By now, gentle reader you know I am a sucker for a good opening line and Ms. Huff’s did not disappoint. By the second paragraph I knew where the story was headed but I decided to give it a chance because I so wanted the train to hurry up and come and deliver dude to his girlfriend’s door so they could make up – boy was I disappointed.!

Vicki Nelson is an ex-cop who had to retire due to her failing eyesight. One night on her way home she hears a scream in the underground train station, going to investigate she gets to the bloody scene only to see a dark shape flee the scene. The story has an interesting twist to it and the characters are solid so you’ll still read on even when you get a dip or two as the story moves along. Enjoy this story and top it off by reading the entire series – it’s worth a weekend in.

This was an average read. But, it may be good for those starting out on this genre. For me, this is a 3.5* and you ? Get it on Amazon below at less than $6.. You can compare this by reading more here|||
