Investigators looking into last year’s data breach and theft of drivers’ records from Uber Technologies Inc. have found indications implicating an executive at rival ride-hailing app Lyft Inc., said people familiar with the matter.

The Uber investigators believe the intruder used a company security key accessible on a public website to access as many as 50,000 driver records in May 2014, Uber said in court records in a lawsuit related to the breach. Uber discovered the breach in September 2014 and disclosed it in February.

Lyft denied that the executive in question, Chief Technology Officer Chris Lambert, or any of its employees were involved in the breach.

“We investigated this matter long ago and there are no facts or evidence that any Lyft employee, including Chris…had anything to do with Uber’s May 2014 data breach,” Lyft spokesman Brandon McCormick said in a written statement.

Uber and Lyft are bitter rivals that have poached drivers from each another, co-opted each other’s innovations and competed to raise billions of dollars in capital. Uber operates in more than 330 cities world-wide and Lyft in 65 cities in the U.S. Last month, Lyft teamed up with Chinese ride-sharing startup Didi Kuaidi Joint Co. to allow users of either app to hail rides from the other’s drivers, in a move regarded as an alliance against Uber.

Uber investigators believe they found evidence linking Lambert to the incident, which goes back to early 2014 and involved several steps, according to the people familiar with the matter.
