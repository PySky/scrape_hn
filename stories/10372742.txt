WhatsApp users will no more have to worry about memory storage capacity of their smartphones as it has announced a back-up feature for Android platform that will help store chats and multimedia content in Google Drive.

“...you don’t want your memories stuck on your phone. (What if something happens?!) So starting today, WhatsApp for Android lets you create a private backup of your chat history, voice messages, photos and videos in Google Drive. And once you do, you can restore everything on a new device with just a couple of taps,” Google Drive Director of Product Management Scott Johnston said in his blog.

“The new backup feature is rolling out over in the next few months, so keep an eye on your WhatsApp settings to see if it’s available,” he said.

“You can back up your messages and media to Google Drive so that if you lose your phone or switch to another Android phone, your chats are safe,” the instant messenger portal said.

The feature will come in a new update for existing Android users. After updating their WhatsApp application, they can go to setting option in the application, select ‘Chats and Calls’ option and opt for frequency — daily, weekly, monthly or never — for saving their data.

However, this update at present is not available in WhatsApp application for Android users in India.

WhatsApp did not respond to the query sent regarding the date when this feature will be available for Indian users.

The mobile instant messenger reported to have over 70 million monthly active users in India till November 2014.

In September, the company disclosed that it has 900 million active users globally.|||
