One of the responsibilities of a design manager is to decide what projects your designers work on. To be as collaborative and transparent as possible, I chose to share my staffing principles with my team, and now publicly as well.

I am currently the UX Design Manager at Opower, where we use behavioral science and user-centered design to nudge people to use less energy. I manage a team of 6 UX designers and 2 contractors. The experience level ranges from interns in school, to designers with 10+ years of experience.

At Opower, UX designers work through the entire design process. This means going from the initial product definition, to delivering specs to engineers, to launching the product. Every quarter I get a list of design project requests after quarterly roadmap planning. To request a designer, product managers write a project brief with business goals, success metrics, and technical constraints. Thatâ€™s how I get a sense of the size and scope of the project, and how to staff it.|||
