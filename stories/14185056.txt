Welcome to Learn Pure React. I'm going to teach you the core concepts of React, in isolation, without Redux, Webpack, and the rest.

There’s a problem with frontend development today: it’s overwhelming. There are thousands of libraries out there, each doing one little thing. The React ecosystem is especially guilty of this: there’s React, Flux, Redux, Reflux, Webpack, Babel, React Router, and on and on. 

Learning everything at once is massively overwhelming. So in this course, we will take a different approach. A more sane approach. We will learn Pure React.
