Our company, ClearTax helps Individuals and Businesses e-File their Tax returns online. We were the first India focused company funded by Y Combinator (YC) in summer of 2014. Subsequently YC funded Razorpay in Winter 2015.

Sam Altman (President of YC) recently in an interview said that India will have multiple $10B companies starting up. I strongly agree with him. Its an exciting time to be a founder in India.

We think YC is fantastic. I highly recommend going to YC to every founder who asks me.

Every application cycle, we get founders asking us for advice on how to get into YC.

I have summarised common themes from (mostly) Indian founders:

There is no secret to getting into YC. You just need to work on your company (Talk to your users and make something people want).

We routinely help founders with their YC apps. I have reviewed quite a few applications recently. I am keen to pay it forward as a lot of founders have helped us and continue to help us.

Common mistakes I see in YC applications (in especially Indian founders).

Writing well will help you win customers, investors, employees, build and sway opinion, so this is not futile.

Start early on that YC app. Ask non-technical friends to review and see if they understood your application. Lets go!|||
