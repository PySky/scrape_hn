Last year we launched R Course Finder, an online directory that helps you to find the right R course quickly. With so many R courses available online, we thought it was a good idea to offer a tool that helps people to compare these courses, before they decide where to spend their valuable time and (sometimes) money.

If you haven’t looked at it yet, go to the R Course Finder now by clicking here.

Last month we added 17 courses to the Course Finder. Currently we are at 171 courses on 18 different online platforms, and 3 offline Learning Institutes.

When working with data, so often we first have to consider data mining, Learning Path: Real-World Data Mining With R offers a complete learning path for this essential problem.

The course, Logistic Regression Workshop using R – Step by Step Modeling really peaked our attention as it seems to be one of the rare cases that promote content quality over advertisement. This relatively short course description does not speak for the content and indepth discussion of Logistic regressions in R.

We have many different courses in our directory that cover the current hype in Data Science, Machine learning, this course R: Complete Machine Learning Solutions covers the whole process front to end, and leaves no room for interpretation. It can be very useful as a back reference for anyone who knows some of these concepts, but wants to return and read about them .

Besides these courses, we also added:

Introduction to R: ETH Zurich

 Data Science Certification Training – R Programming

 Creating Interactive Presentations with Shiny and R

 R: Complete Data Visualization Solutions

 R Programming from Scratch

 Volatility Trading Analysis with R
