A Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Below graph shows order in which the nodes are discovered in DFS â€“

Below is the list of commonly asked interview questions that can be solved using DFS â€“
