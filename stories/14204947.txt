Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See http://dlib.net for the main project documentation and API reference.

Go into the examples folder and type:

That will build all the examples. If you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions then turn them on like this:

Doing so will make some things run faster.

The examples folder has a CMake tutorial that tells you what to do. There are also additional instructions on the dlib web site.

Before you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:

if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some things run faster. Note that you need to have boost-python installed to compile the Python API.

Type the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:

Note that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a subfolder called . If that's the case then you have to go to that folder before running the test.
