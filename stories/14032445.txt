Slack security manager Leigh Honeywell is leaving the workplace communications company for a year-long technology fellowship with the American Civil Liberties Union.

Honeywell, 32, is perhaps best known of late for organizing the Never Again pledge that gained nearly 3,000 signatures from tech employees vowing to refuse to help build a Muslim registry as proposed by President Donald Trump during his campaign.

Honeywell managed the team responsible for responding to security breaches at the workplace communication startup and has been there for two years. She reported to chief security officer Geoff Belknap.

She said in an interview that her role at the civil liberties nonprofit will involve research, communicating with media and advising its lawyers. She added that she was also interested in working on issues related to the Internet privacy regulations recently repealed by Congress.

“When the executive orders on immigration came down in January, as an immigrant myself, I felt that I needed to do more to fight for issues that I care about,” said Honeywell, who is from Ottawa and lives in the United States on an H-1B visa.|||
