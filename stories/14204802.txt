Automation isn’t new to display campaigns on the Google Display Network, but with the new Smart display campaigns, it’s not just the creative that’s automated. Targeting, bidding and the ads all run on autopilot powered by machine learning.

The system pulls advertiser-provided headlines, descriptions, logos and images to create responsive text, display and native ads. Bids are set, based on Target CPAs, for each auction as the system determines the likelihood of conversion.

To analyze performance, the table view of asset details under the Ads tab will show data for each asset (copy, images and so on), including a “best,” “good” or “low” grade based on its ability to generate conversions — note the asset grades are relative to each other. You can get rid of “low” grade assets and replace them.|||

The new campaign type applies machine learning to all aspects of campaign optimization.
