After our earlier article showing you how you can still get Windows 10 for free, we got to thinking about freebies. Which led to this question: What are the best free software alternatives to paid applications? So we started to compile a list. One that we thought could be useful to you. We have tried to include most of the mainstream uses of a computer and give options across all platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux). But there will inevitably be something we missed. However, the massive list of free software alternatives below are sure to throw up something useful to you.

And if you liked the list, or found it useful, please be sure to share it with others who might find it beneficial. You can check out part two here.

Any free software alternatives we have forgotten or should have included? Have your say in the comments. Also, part two is now up so be sure to check it out for even more freebies!|||
