When a keyboard is visible and you click the back button, it hides the keyboard.  How do you intercept this event to not only hide the keyboard but also hide other UI that is visible (in the screenshot I want to hide the search suggestions as well as the keyboard when the back button is pressed)?  I tried overridingbut this method does not get called until after the keyboard is hidden.So for example, keyboard is opened you click the back button.  The keyboard will hide butwill not get called.  If you click the back button then nowwill get called.|||
