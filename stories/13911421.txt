We wanted to provide customers notice of how a possible hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited will affect your GDAX account.

The only version of Bitcoin supported on GDAX today is Bitcoin Core, currently represented by the symbol BTC.

We may provide support for Bitcoin Unlimited in the future depending on market conditions and stability of the protocol, but we cannot guarantee whether or when such support may be available. Customers who wish to access both blockchains at the time of the hard fork should withdraw their BTC from GDAX since we cannot guarantee what will happen during the hard fork or when this access may be available.

If one chain receives an overwhelming majority of support from miners, users, and exchanges, we reserve the right to alter the name of chains or discontinue support for certain chains in the future.

Ensuring the safety of customer funds is our top priority. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, it is likely that we will temporarily suspend the deposit, withdrawal and trading of bitcoin on GDAX pending our assessment of the technical risks posed by the fork, such as the possibility of replay attacks, network instability, and other factors. Customers should take note that they will not be able to withdraw bitcoin from or deposit bitcoin to GDAX for a period of up to 24 hours or more following a fork.

We look forward to working with development teams and other exchanges to ensure the smooth execution of any hard forks with as little disruption as possible. Customers can monitor our Status Page and Twitter for the latest updates from GDAX.|||
