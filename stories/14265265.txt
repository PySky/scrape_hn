After retiring its elephants from its touring show, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced in January that it would be shutting down in May. The circus’s final show will take place later this month in Uniondale, New York, but the company has announced that it will broadcast the entire performance on Facebook Live.

The final performance is set for May 21st at 7PM ET, at the Nassau Veteran’s Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. A teaser for the broadcast invites viewers to “watch with the the world” as the circus’s performers take the stage one last time. This isn’t the first time the company has streamed on internet for a final bow: the circus's vice president of digital and relationship marketing, Sam Gomez, told the AP that it did something similar in 2016 for the final elephant show. The video will be left online for a short time after the performance.

The parent company for the circus, Feld Entertainment Inc., said in January that the removal of the elephants from its act made touring difficult; the remaining 11 animals were sent to the company’s 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation last year.|||
