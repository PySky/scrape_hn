Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) and Namibia University Of Science And Technology (NUST) have agreed to collaborate and establish a Virtual Space Data Centre in Windhoek. The Data Centre will assist Namibia in monitoring and growing key elements of the economy.

“The Centre will find wide applications in Namibia in the fields of aviation, maritime and land transportation, urbanisation, mapping and surveying, human health, disaster management, food security and sustainable agriculture, environmental monitoring and natural resources management. The data will be made available to government ministries and various entities,” said Dr Tjama Tjivikua, NUST Vice-Chancellor.

The Namibian government has delegated NUST to host the Institute for Space Technology and mandated it to implement the Virtual Space Data Centre, as part of its strategic plan for developing the country’s aerospace, geo-information, earth observation and spatial science capabilities.

“Namibia is a key market for Airbus in Sub-Saharan Africa and we see this initial project as the starting point for a broader relationship with our partners at NUST and the Ministry of Higher Education, Training and Innovation, which will include other aerospace themes,” said Dr Jean-Marc Nasr, the Head of Airbus Defence and Space for Africa, Middle East, France and the UK.

Added to the data centre, ADS and NUST will collaborate on developing academic postgraduate programmes in various fields of Aerospace Technology, e.g. Satellite Ground Element Technology, Space Technology, Aerospace Dynamics research and industry. In return, NUST will also link to the Airbus Academy and French universities.
