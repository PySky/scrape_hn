Turns out, playing video games can pay off quite handsomely—at least for some people.

Variety reports that big-time Minecraft streamer Jordan “CaptainSparklez” Maron recently purchased a 3 bedroom/5 bathroom mansion that overlooks L.A.’s Sunset Strip. It’s a really nice place—I mean, that picture up top? That’s just a segment of the overall house. Look at this!

Damn. Here are a few more pictures, courtesy of Nicholas Property Group. Note that the mansion is said to feature an outdoor fireplace, a sunken wet bar, and an infinity swimming pool:

Maron, who is only 23, has 8.8 million subscribers on YouTube, and millions of views on Twitch—not to mention an official action figure which can be purchased at major retailers. Here’s a recent video, in case you’d like to get a taste of what this guy’s material is like:

Earlier this year, Minecraft creator Notch made headlines after purchasing the most expensive house in Beverly Hills. Apparently, Captainsparklez’ pad is just “a few thousand feet away” from Notch’s house, which is kind of funny. This whole thing sure is a sign of the times, huh? Both game creators and players can make it big off a game now, a fact which is as amazing as it is demoralizing.|||
