Thanks to the incredible success of shared bike apps, the bicycle is making a comeback in China, and nowhere was that more apparent than in Shenzhen on Monday.

On that day, 300,000 people celebrated the Qingming Festival holiday by visiting the Shenzhen Bay Park -- many of them arriving on their bikes. According to the park's management office, 10,000 bicycles entered the park on Monday.

Photos and videos from inside the park, show tourists nearly unable to walk along the bay because of the insane amount of parked shared bikes taking up space along the waterfront.

Rather than try to find their shared bike in that parking hell, many visitors simply left their bicycles behind.

To prevent this kind of thing from happening again, Shenzhen authorities snapped into action, issuing a ban on bikes inside the park for Tuesday. At the same time, they called representatives of five bike-sharing companies including Mobike and Ofo in for a meeting to tell them how it was gonna be. At the end of the meeting, the companies all agreed to help clear the park of shared bikes before the morning.

And just look at what a change a little regulation can make:

Shenzhen isn't the only Chinese city dealing with problems created by the booming bike-sharing market. Last month, images went viral online showing some 4,000 seized shared bikes brightening up a parking lot in Shanghai. The bicycles had been left parked illegally in the sidewalk or street by their careless users. Shanghai authorities are currently working on rules that will become China's first effort at regulating the bike-sharing business.|||
