When we launched Surfly, our goal was to make it very easy to share a browsing session with someone else. You can imagine our surprise when we suddenly were seeing a high number of sessions with an odd trait: no one else seemed to join their session. Most of these sessions where originating from Arabic countries and it took us some time before we understood the main reason behind it. After some research it became clear to us that most of these users where actually using Surfly not for the social aspect of sharing a session, but mainly to access the free internet. Not everybody has access to free, unpoliced internet and through Surfly they were able to bypass company or country specific rules that prevented net neutrality. We live in a rapidly changing world, and while in 2016 the Obama administration pushed for net neutrality, things have taken a different turn in 2017. Only yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a bill allowing ISP’s to sell YOUR browsing history.  At Surfly we believe in a free and open internet where net citizens are allowed to protect their privacy.

This is why we decided to launch Surfly Labs. Surfly’s co-browsing solution is build on top of our advanced content-rewriting proxy. We use this mainly to add some extra features to basic browsing, so that an active web session can be easily shared with others. This approach, however, allows us to do a lot of different things that might not be immediately obvious. With these labs we want to show proof of concept of what is possible with our technology. Some of our experiments are very closely related to the use case of co-browsing, and others will venture into a completely different terrain. Some examples include:|||
