this is your regular warning that the software everyone thinks of as “openoffice” is actually a shambling corpse (rip 2011) that the apache software foundation keeps pretending is a live project and not dead yet, despite its dismal inability to literally even build its own software or release security fixes in under six months. and you should be using libreoffice, which is the openoffice variant that has hundreds of developers, releases twice monthly and gives a damn about its users.

after 4.1.2 had a security hole since october 2015 the project didn’t tell anyone about for nine months, the board put the project on monthly reporting. with herculean effort they managed to compile and put out 4.1.3 in december 2016.

so the apache board minutes for january 2017 were finally released, and whoops! turns out aoo 4.1.3 has another hole they haven’t told anyone else about.

but that’s okay, the vital and fast-moving project will get a fix out quick-smart. what’s that? the release manager has disappeared without trace? gosh.

get off openoffice. get everyone you know off openoffice. get libreoffice. 5.3 is out now, 5.4 in july is looking good.

[please spread this message far and wide]

update: the apache software foundation edited its january minutes to remove mention of the security hole in apache openoffice. before, after. the register busted them. fixed software in may apparently (i’ll believe it when i see it). i knew apache had contempt for end users, i didn’t realise they had this much contempt.
