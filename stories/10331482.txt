WaveformGenerator.js is a simple and small library for JavaScript which generates waveform from audio, either as PNG or SVG data.

You can change the color of the waveform, the width of bars, width of gaps between bars and the bars alignment.

Grab the JavaScript file from the directory.

WaveformGenerator can also be inststalled with Bower:

Create a waveform by creating a new instance of WaveformGenerator and passing an array buffer and a settings object. The WaveformGenerator will return a Promise with the URL to the generated waveform.

You can create a new generator without any settings. The generator will then use the default settings which is a normal waveform aligned in the center with a #bada55 (badass) color.

To generate waveform with your own settings, put an object with the settings in the second argument of the WaveformGenerator, right after the arrayBuffer.

You can change he following settings in the WaveformGenerator by passing your own settings object.

. ( ). ( , ( ) { Create file reader to read the file as an ArrayBuffer reader (); Tell the reader to read the file as an ArrayBuffer . ( . . [ ]); When the reader has loaded the read the file as an ArrayBuffer . ( ) { arrayBuffer . . ; pngSettings {drawMode }; 'png' is default. Can be omitted. svgSettings {drawMode }; (arrayBuffer, pngSettings). ( ( ) { . ( ). pngWaveformUrl; }); (arrayBuffer, svgSettings). ( ( ) { . ( ). svgWaveformUrl; }); }; }, ); .|||
