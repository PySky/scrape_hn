space-vim is a vim distribution for vim plugins and resources, compatible with Vim and NeoVim.

It is inspired by spacemacs and mimics spacemacs in a high level, especially in the whole architecture, key bindings and GUI.

If you are unfamiliar with spacemacs, you can visit spacemacs.org for more about the priciple behind that, which is also what space-vim seeks.|||
