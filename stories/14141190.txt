I recently noticed that when there is a discussion involving beer, someone will eventually reference a small, amazing brewery, or say something like ‘‘oh, but you have to go to Minneapolis, it has the best breweries’’ (almost true). But not everyone can be right. Since a brewery is only as good as its beers, I looked at the available data to make that claim. So what makes Santa Rosa so good? When you boil it down to a weighted blend of quality (beer ratings) and quantity (breweries in proximity), Santa Rosa tops the list.

Which gives us the top 50 cities for beer-lovers in the US. The bigger the circle, the higher the ranking.
