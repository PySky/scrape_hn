A few years ago I had a revelation — sunglasses matters, especially when it comes to lenses color.

I’m a pale mediterranean man with dark hair and dark eyes. For the better part of my life, I have been wearing black frames, which most times came with black or other dark colored lenses (boring… I know.)

The Halloween that I dressed up as the great Kenny (fucking) Powers changed everything! I went all out and got the Charros baseball team t-shirt, a mullet wig on eBay and found some ridiculous sunglasses at a convenience store. When I put on the glasses though, I had a revelation — the yellow lenses were making me happier!!! (in the picture I’m wearing blue ones, my friend Dan insisted on switching because he liked their effect as well.)

The glasses really did make everything look better! The sky, the clouds, the trees, the water… everything was much more vibrant and beautiful! I could look at anything and see the world as a better place ☮

In that moment I realized I need to change my regular sunglasses and choose some with brighter lenses. Even if it means they won’t look as cool as the dark ones on me. Fuck it. I rather have a more positive outlook.

My piece of advice to you is to give brighter lenses a shot! I promise your happiness aura will outshine a bit of color mismatching.

P.S. — polarized lenses are awesome! not mandatory, but worth the money if you take good care of your shades.|||
