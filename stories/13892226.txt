mscgen_js was made to go both ways:

Moreover MsGenny, the simplified subset, translates to MscGen with the flip of a switch.

If you find proof to the contrary on any of this tell us.

See build.md. If you want to understand how mscgen_js' innards work: we try to explain that in the script folder.

This software is free software licensed under GPLv3. This means (a.o.) you can use it as part of other free software, but not as part of non free software. We have a slight relaxation for when you'd want to use .

In addition to the GNU public license, for the use of the minified version of the embedding code ( ) as described on embedding a special exception to the GPL is made:

As a special exception to the GPL, any HTML file which merely makes function calls to mscgen-inpage.js, and for that purpose includes it by reference shall be deemed a separate work for copyright law purposes. In addition, the copyright holders of this code give you permission to combine this code with free software libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL. You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for this code and the LGPL for the libraries. If you modify this code, you may extend this exception to your version of the code, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

mscgen_js is built on various libraries, each of which have their own license (incidentally all MIT style):

It uses mocha, chai, istanbul, eslint, plato and nsp to maintain some modicum of verifiable code quality. You can see the build history in Travis and an indication of the shape of the code at Code Climate .|||
