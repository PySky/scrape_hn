Python library to programmaticaly purcahse/redeem mutual funds in India using the Bombay Stock Exchange StarMF platform's API and web portal

I built and operated a mutual fund investing platform as an AMFI licensed mutual fund distributor for a year. I used the library to programmatically make and track over Rs 50 lacs of investment for several investors. It was built over a week in Sep 2016 and works as of May 2017. Since my investing website was built on django, you will see some parts of that in the code though django is an optional requirement. You can build this platform without or with any other framework of your choice.

The finance industry believes that differentiation in fintech can come from building an execution/transaction platform. I believe on the contrary that execution will soon be commoditized and differentiation will come from better products, ease of their use and large-scale distribution. This is why I am open-sourcing my mutual fund execution platform.

Bombay Stock Exchange runs a MF execution platform called StarMF. Distributors like me can plug into it and place transactions in any mutual fund without setting up a payment gateway, settlement system or signing agreements directly with MF companies. BSEStarMF offers

Meat of the library is in 2 files:

3 key data structures are necessary for a mutual fund transaction platform. Regulations require to carefully archive this data for 5 years.

These 2 files show how to use and in your code. I have used django management commands for easy demonstration, but treat them as simple python files

Feel free to raise an issue and I will get back asap|||
