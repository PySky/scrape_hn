The turnover of Breitling, which produces 140,000 to 150,000 watches a year, is around 370 million Swiss francs. Although nothing is known about the earnings situation, analysts estimate the purchase price for the company at 600 to 900 million Swiss francs. In the industry it is rumored that Breitling wants to sell the company. It was reported that an investment bank was commissioned to look for possible prospective buyers.

In a larger alliance, there would be a whole lot of advantages: according to Réé Weber, Vontobel’s industry analysis, the Swatch Group (Tissot, Hamilton, Longines, Rado, Omega, Breguet and Blancpain), Richemont (Montblanc, IWC, Cartier, Jaeger-LeCoultre and Piaget) or the French LVMH Group (Tag Heuer, Hublot, Bulgari and Zenith) would also be interested in a takeover of Breitling.|||
