Geeonx ... is a window system. ... is a lean Grahpical User Interface (GUI). ... is a shared library.. ... is made for Linux and in future for MacOS X. ... is a non-profit project

Geeonx draws and updates all GUI-elements like windows, pulldown-menus, icons, inputforms and buttons of your application that you have created before with the tool GeeonxCreator. With the tool GeeonxCreator you are able to design all GUI-elements of your application. Geeonx stores the data of each and every GUI element in a corresponding Geeonx object. GeeonxCreator stores the GUI data into a *.gee and *.gew file. The Geeonx shared library will take over all drawings of GUI elements inclusive window content. The library will also handle all window, button or input events. For example with Geeonx your are able to create forms for the input of text by the user. The Geeonx *.gee and *.gew files are 32/64 bit binary compatibel. Therefore you can design your interface for your application and use the files generated by GeeonxCreator for the 32 bit and the 64 bit version of your application. Hence it is very easy to program applications with windows, buttons and icons. For example to alter the content of a window you just change the text_string within the structure of the Geeonx_object. With the call of the function gee_draw_all_objects() the whole interface of the application will be updated. The LINUX version of the Geeonx library works with or without X-Windows. That means Geeonx applications can be executed on lean systems without a X.org -installation. Users can enjoy applications with sophisticated interfaces even in lean or embedded environments. The Geeonx library is written in C programming language and offers an API for the use with C/C++. After the Geeonx version for MacOS X is finished you can create applications for Linux and MacOS X with a highly identical sourcecode.|||
