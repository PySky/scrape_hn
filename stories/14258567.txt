Is it always necessary to be a product designer or an insanely good coder in order to build a startup? I’ve been thinking about this question for quite a while now. Regarding this question I asked Justin Kan (YC Partner, Co-founder of Twitch and Co-founder of Whale) using the whale app. Before we go to to his answer, let’s dissect all the benefits of being a technical founder of your own startup.

One of the benefits being a technical founder and I guess the most important aspect of doing startups is to understand your product inside out. By knowing what kind of technologies you’re using for the product and how it works, will make the founder care more on the product because he/she would recognize what’s unique, weaknesses and strengths that the product has. The founder should also maintain the quality standard of the product which must be consistent according to the company’s culture. When a founder doesn’t know how to code or design product, it’s a very high chance that the founder doesn’t maintain the quality standard.

It would be a huge advantage for the startup not to hire engineers at early stage, especially when the product hasn’t even reach product market fit. Average salary of a software engineer is somewhere around $90k. Well this could be less or more depending to their years of experience, but it’s still a lot of money.

Conclusion that I made: There’s no right or wrong path in order to become a startup founder, but there are different ways to learn. I guess my advice would be, “get/hire a co-founder who is good at what you’re bad at”.|||
