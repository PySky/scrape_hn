Internet companies like Google and Apple are abusing their power and scale, a number of European technology businesses such as Spotify have claimed.

The chief executives of music streaming service Spotify, rival firm Deezer and Rocket Internet among others, sent a letter to the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, claiming that online platforms "can and do abuse their privileged position".

"Our collective experience is that where online platforms have a strong incentive to turn into gatekeepers because of their dual role, instead of maximizing consumer welfare," the CEOs wrote.|||

European technology CEOs accused some online platforms of biased search rankings and restricting access to data.
