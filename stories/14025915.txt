Weave Scope automatically generates a map of your application, enabling you to intuitively understand, monitor, and control your containerized, microservices based application.

Choose an overview of your container infrastructure, or focus on a specific microservice. Easily identify and correct issues to ensure the stability and performance of your containerized applications.

View contextual metrics, tags and metadata for your containers. Effortlessly navigate between processes inside your container to hosts your containers run on, arranged in expandable, sortable tables. Easily to find the container using the most CPU or memory for a given host or service.

Interact with your containers directly: pause, restart and stop containers. Launch a command line. All without leaving the scope browser window.

Add custom details or interactions for your hosts, containers and/or processes by creating Scope plugins; or just choose from some that others have already written at the Github Weaveworks Scope Plugins organization.

This script downloads and runs a recent Scope image from Docker Hub. Now, open your web browser to http://localhost:4040. (If you're using boot2docker, replace localhost with the output of .)
