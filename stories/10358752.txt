Truffle is a framework to implement high-performance dynamic and domain specific languages. The deep embedding of DSLs for domains such as image, query and regular expression processing is highly relevant for language runtimes. Truffle's combined partial evaluation and compilation of dynamic languages with DSLs enables compiler optimizations beyond the possibilities of a single language compiler.



In this lecture we will introduce Truffle as a tool to develop DSLs. We will show and explain how we use it for JRuby to optimize complex Ruby expressions.



In a hands-on session we will optimize and modify our demonstration language Simple Language. Students are expected to prepare themselves with a working environment for the Truffle SimpleLanguage.|||
