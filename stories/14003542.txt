The company behind the successful OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T is always looking to expand its range of products, and in recent months it has begun offering a number of accessories, swag and gear including clothing and bags.

Now, OnePlus feels ready to leverage its Dash Charge technology into a whole new class of product: highly-limited Energy Drinks. The new Dash Energy will become available soon, and you’ll be able to get a taste of its electrolyte-infused performance this April 1st in select locations including London and India. If you have been looking for a new kind of gamer fuel, look no further. Just take a look at this sweet specs sheet:

Clearly nutritional. OnePlus claims that their energy drink technology allows the company to “unlock a person’s hidden potential” by limiting their sleep cycles to just half an hour a day, inline with their Dash Charge’s “A Day’s Power in Half an Hour” marketing slogan. I’ve received one of these Dash Charge energy drinks, and while I can’t say that I am sure it has passed any kind of regulation, it tasted pretty good… Well, kind of. Good enough, I guess? I’ve had worse in Argentina.

I know what you are thinking — what on Earth is OnePlus doing? I honestly have no clue either, but if you want to check it out for yourself, on April 1st you’ll be able to get a taste in Bishops Square, Spitalfields, London from 12PM to 4PM, and you can also visit the OnePlus Experience Store in Bangalore, India should that be closer to you. If you happen to reside in the EU, you can also enter the raffle online for a chance to win a four-pack of this highly limited energy drink.

So there you go. If you saw OnePlus teasing a Dash Charge announcement yesterday and thought you’d be getting something awesome like a new power pack, I’d like to say I’m sorry. Also, hahaha, why would you expect that? Have you forgotten about the OnePlus 3T Colette Edition? In any case, we’ll be doing an in-depth review of the Dash Energy later this afternoon on social media, so stay tuned for that (if you really want to waste your time).
