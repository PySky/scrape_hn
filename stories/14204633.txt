It can be a lot of work to pick the best plants for your home. At Bloom, we developed the Plant Similarity Index - a simple metric designed to identify similar plants. This can inspire you to make great choices or substitutions in a pinch.

Not just the same color or name. We look at a lot of factors to determine what's statistically similar: height and width, plant type (e.g. perennial), leaf types, flower and foliage colors, and more. Ideally, it should be a equally good fit for the space with some matching characteristics.
