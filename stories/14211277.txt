Ethereum and other technologies have sparked a wave of decentralized applications (Dapps). These apps run directly on the blockchain, making them globally accessible and eliminating the need for trusted parties. No longer do you need a bank to hold your money or Wall St to trade stocks. This enables Dapps to solve many problems which were previously impossible. A few examples are:

We believe two main prerequisites for widespread usage of decentralized apps are discovery and trust.

Right now there is no easy way to discover and navigate to these applications. Services such as Etherscan focus more on the raw data which exists on the blockchain, rather than connecting users with content. Search engines such as Google are designed for traditional websites, which exist on a fundamentally different platform than decentralized apps. By indexing directly from the blockchain, Weipoint hopes to provide the most complete and relevant content to users.

It’s currently too hard for all but the most technical users to determine which Dapps are trustworthy and secure. Similarly, it’s also difficult for Dapp creators to establish trust for their users. Weipoint plans to solve these problems by providing a platform for reputation and proof of ownership, and by connecting Dapp creators with security reviewers. We can then incorporate these in search results to ensure users are able to quickly establish trust for a Dapp.

It’s still early days for both Weipoint and the entire decentralized community, but we hope to grow with the ecosystem and help spark the rise of the decentralized revolution.

Weipoint can be used to search for and interact with Ethereum smart contracts. We’re planning to add search for entire Dapps in the near future and eventually anything behind decentralized domain…
