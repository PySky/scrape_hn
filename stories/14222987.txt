 The IAB’s Internet Advertising Revenue Report, a survey conducted independently by PricewaterhouseCoopers, is released in full twice a year, to coincide with the collection of half-year and full-year data. At the end of the first and third quarters, the IAB releases via press release estimated, top-line reports. The results reported are considered the most accurate measurement of Internet/online advertising revenues since the data is compiled directly from information supplied by companies selling advertising online. All-inclusive, the report includes data reflecting online advertising revenues from Web sites, commercial online services, Email providers, as well as other companies selling online advertising.
