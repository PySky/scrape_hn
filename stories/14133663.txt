Bet you regret deleting all those emails you got from that Nigerian prince.

More than $43 million in U.S. dollar notes was uncovered in an apartment in Nigeria by the country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.

The EFCC announced on Facebook that they had received a whistleblower's tip that someone had been moving bags in and out of the apartment.

Naturally, everyone only had one thing to say about this.

The news trended after social media users quickly picked up on the fact that the event occurred in Nigeria â€” a reference to the many scam emails often sent from a "Nigerian royal figure" soliciting users to transfer thousands of dollars with the promise of a larger reward at the end.

Most of the emails start off with something like this:

According to the EFCC, in addition to the U.S. dollars, $75,000 worth of Nigerian currency and $35,000 in British pound sterling were also found "neatly arranged" inside fireproof cabinets hidden behind wooden panels.

Earlier last week, the EFCC uncovered some $817,000 in cash from a market in Lagos, and some $1.5 million at a shopping mall.

Nigeria is ranked 136 out of 176 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index in 2016.|||
