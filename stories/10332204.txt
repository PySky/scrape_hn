As described in a press release published on PR Newswire, MediaTek released two SDKs (software development kits) that come with built-in support for Apple's HomeKit home automation framework.

The two SDKs can be used to develop Internet of Things solutions with the help of two IoT SoCs (system on a chip), the MT7688 and MT7687. Using the two SoCs, hardware design companies can create devices that can be effortlessly integrated within the Internet of Things network.

SR Tsai, General Manager of MediaTek's Wireless Connectivity and Networking Business Unit, said in the PR Newswire press release that "by adding HomeKit support, MediaTek takes another step in our mission to connect the world's next billion people. Customers have been looking for innovative, simple and secure technologies that power their home and our new SDKs with HomeKit support delivers that to them."

Apple's HomeKit framework is designed to allow developers with all the tools needed to create applications that help users to control and communicate with all devices present in their home that come with HomeKit support.

With the help of HomeKit, a user can control HomeKit-enabled devices in his home using voice commands and Apple's Siri virtual assistant.

Moreover, HomeKit also makes it easy to connect several products in a group and control them all at once using a single voice with the help of Siri.

As described on Apple's HomeKit page, individuals and companies interested in developing HomeKit-enabled hardware have to enroll in Apple's MFi Program which provides them with the MFi license required to obtain access to the resources needed for building hardware that embeds HomeKit technology.

Apple has published a list of all accessories that work with HomeKit on their support website, updated on October 2, 2015, to include the ConnectSense Smart Outlet GC-CS-SO, iDevices Switch Connected Plug IDEV0001 and the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt line.

This is the second sign that Apple is really getting serious about the Internet of Things in just as many days, after their very recent acquisition of Cambridge-based VocalIQ artificial-intelligence company that gets Apple a new machine-learning-based conversational voice-dialog technology which can be used to improve the control interface with Internet of Things (IoT) device.|||
