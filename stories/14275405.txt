In the wake of things like GamerGate, Brexit, and the American election, it seems pretty clear that the tech industry needs a backgrounder for people who want to know more about how our political, legal, and economic systems actually work. Having produced half a dozen crowd-sourced books on open source software and software engineering over the last ten years (see here, here, and here), our goal now is to create something like Physics for Future Presidents, but instead of (for example) explaining nuclear power to someone who might one day run the country, we want to explain things like voter suppression to people who might one day build online voting platforms.|||
