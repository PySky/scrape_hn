DID I MENTION IT'S ALL OPEN SOURCE?

HOW TO TRANSLATE THEM CAPTIONS

only skims the surface of psychology/neuroscience, so if you want a deeper dive, do check out this Crash Course video on conditioning, and these Wikipedia articles on Hebbian Learning and Anti-Hebbian Learning But the most important concept I wanted to introduce here was exposure therapy, which is part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT is basically being mindful of your crappy neural connections, and gaining skills to retrain those connections. The article that most helped me understand CBT — and had a huge impact on my personal life — is this article, CBT is for Hackers (Also, go readbook on CBT, Feeling Good by David Burns.)So that's the further reading on brain stuff. The other part ofis its weird interactive format, a hybrid of "game" and animated explainers like Vi Hart, CGP Grey, and Kurzgesagt. I was inspired by Bret Victor's 2011 article, Explorable Explanations , another interactive hybrid.Here's some behind-the-scenes blog posts I wrote on Neurotic Neurons: the creation process , the design lessons learnt , and my confessions of what I simplified If you gots questions, please tweet me at @ncasenmare .
