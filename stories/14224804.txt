On April 15, 2017, a small conference on the topic of Functional Programming in Swift will happen in Brooklyn (similar to the 2014, 2015 and 2016 editions). We will have a day filled with awesome talks and lots of great conversation.

Kickstarter has kindly offered to host us, and provide snacks, lunch, and drinks. Their offices are located at 58 Kent St, Greenpoint, close the G train and Greenpoint Ferry Terminal.

Join us at 10am for breakfast snacks and conversations with other functional programming enthusiasts. There will be 30m talks, lunch will be served around 1pm, and the entire conference should be over around 6pm.

Tickets are available here.

We think that diversity is important: people are diverse, problems and opportunities are diverse, and conferences are better when they reflect that. Here is our inclusivity policy.
