New projects almost always need some sort of back end to serve data or authenticate users. Back end development is a complicated and costly thing, almost always requiring external sources, but it shouldn't be. Pica Pica provides a simple interface that enables you to create a RESTful API in minutes that is built into a Docker container. You can then run it anywhere quickly without hassle, so that you can start building the important parts: the things your users actually see.|||
