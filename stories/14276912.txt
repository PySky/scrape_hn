Getting a job at a major tech or finance firm, even as a summer intern, often means surpassing much of the rest of the country financially.

Amazon, Apple, BlackRock, Google, Facebook, Bank of America, Capital One and others all pay their summer interns more per month than the average American makes, according to data released Tuesday by jobs website Glassdoor.

Facebook interns, the top-earning summer interns in the country, make an average of $8,000 per month, according to Glassdoor. If a Facebook intern worked for 12 months, that would come out to a salary of $96,000.

The average full-time working American makes $51,350 a year, according to data collected by Glassdoor in April. That's $4279 per month, before taxes.|||
