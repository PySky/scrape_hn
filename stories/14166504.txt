Supposedly, each Huawei P10 contains different components. Is that correct? Huawei has now replied.

 A few days ago rumors circulated that the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus have different memories installed.

This partly leads to extreme differences in the speed of the smartphones.

While some models produce read-only data of more than 700 megabytes per second (MB/s), other specimens only reach 300 MB/s.

An official confirmation from Huawei so far had existed. But now, the Chinese company surprisingly responded to AndroidAuthority and confirmed the rumors.

According to the report, the current LPDDR4 or the older LPDDR3 memory is installed in the memory, depending on the model and availability. With internal memory, Huawei uses UFS 2.0, UFS 2.1 or eMMC 5.1 to create even more different components.

And it gets even better: Huawei completely replaces the parts in the devices. Thus, it is not possible to use the model number to determine which combination of memory and internal memory is used.

Completely unusual is this procedure not: Samsung, for example, different processors, Apple, however, different modems.

However, in the normal case, this does not provide for such fluctuations as in the case of the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus.|||
