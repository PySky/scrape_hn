Samsung NX1 and the newly released NX500 have the ability to support both 4K and UHD video recording. The built-in H.265/HEVC Codec, the most advanced compression technology available, brings efficiency to the storage of video clips by compressing high quality video to half the size and the bit rate of H.264 footage 

without any compromise on quality. The only problem is, H.265/HEVC has not yet been accepted by most media devices, editing software and more. 

To make Samsung NX1 footage widely supported, we teach you how to convert SamsungNX1 H.265 to H.264Â MP4 with ease.
