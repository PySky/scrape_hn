The Random Sanity Project is a free, open source service that helps secure the Internet by sanity-checking sources of randomness. If you are a CTO or system administrator responsible for a security-critical web server or application running on the Internet you should consider using this service to alert you of catastrophic hardware or software failures that could completely compromise the security of your website or application.

The service is in an early stage of development; I am looking for people willing to use it, test it, provide feedback, and maybe even write a little code to help make it better.

For example, if you are using openssl as your source of randomness, you could sanity-test it with this bash code:

You should see “true” as the result. Re-run the curl command with the same BYTES and the result will be “false”, because a good source of randomness will never generate the same 64 bytes twice (with insanely high probability). See the details page if you’re curious about exactly what it is doing with your bytes.

Read the API documentation. If you’re running Debian or Ubuntu, install the check /dev/urandom at startup init.d script; if you’re running RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, Luke Macken has created a systemd startup script that does the check.
