Most university libraries in the UK charge their users fines for overdue and/or recalled library items. To find out how much money each university received in the academic year 2015/16, freedom of information (FOI) requests were sent to 148 UK universities. These FOI requests were made during February/March of 2017 using the website "www.whatdotheyknow.com". <br><br>The results are collated in this spreadsheet,which includes links to the URLs that contain the full FOI correspondence in each case. Some institutions were also able to provide a breakdown of payment by country of origin (e.g. France, Italy) as well as type of user (e.g. undergraduate/postgraduate). Those institutions that were able to provide this information are indicated in the spreadsheet. <br><br>The spreadsheet is organised in descending order, with those institutions receiving the most amount of money at the top of the spreadsheet, with those receiving the least amount of money at the bottom.<br><br>The total amount of money received was Â£4,806,32.<div><br>The text of the FOI request made in each case is as follows:<br><i><br><br>"I am writing to ask about library fines during the academic year 2015/2016.
