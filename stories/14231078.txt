A job post has revealed that streaming TV company Netflix is set to adapt their official UWP app for the HoloLens mixed reality environment.

A Netflix spokesperson has confirmed that the deal won’t revolve around 3D content, but rather on delivering 2D content in an immersive environment much like on their Oculus Rift app (below). Netflix is said to be sceptical about the demand for full 3D content beyond gaming.

While this may be tepid support, with a comfortable enough VR headset the experience can actually be quite immersive and offer a big screen experience without having a massive display on the wall, so the timely arrival of the app will be quite welcome.|||
