The HERO is a new kind of blockchain-based digital currency. It has all the advantages of crypto currencies (fast, cheap transaction, no middlemen, counterpart-party risk free, decentralized, accessible, etc.) but, unlike others, HERO have a predictable price. This predictability constitutes a stable, USD-pegged, component and a yearly capital appreciation of 5%. This fixed yearly capital appreciation isnâ€™t quite like interest as it does not pay out HEROs every once in a while, but instead, the USD-valuation of HERO grows at a fixed 5% per year.
