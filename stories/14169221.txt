Google and Mozilla have known about this bug since late January but yet to rectify it for the billion or so Firefox and Chrome users. It’s a relatively simple issue to fix so it’s mystifying why Mozilla and Google would delay or refrain from protecting their users from potentially devastating, undetectable attacks that could steal their banking and other login credentials.
