When trained with enough raw data, neural networks can ‘learn’ the subject matter they’re fed and come up with unique material of their own, whether that means creating original art, writing novels or accompanying you on the piano.

Now, researcher Janelle C Shane is putting her neural network framework to work on a project we can all benefit from: generating pickup lines.

After going through the painful process of collecting a dataset of lines from around the web, she fed them to her network. Eventually, it understood what the building blocks of a pickup line were like, and thankfully, as Shane noted, “never learned to generate the worst lines (ones which were obscene, or aggressive, or kind of insulting) – most of these were based on wordplay that it didn’t have a chance of reproducing.”

The results are a tad clumsy, but cute when you consider the fact that they came out of a machine. Here are my favorites:

You are so beautiful that you make me feel better to see you. Are you a candle? Because you’re so hot of the looks with you. You look like a thing and I love you.

I’m stealing the last one.

There’s more where that came from; head to Shane’s blog to read the rest.
