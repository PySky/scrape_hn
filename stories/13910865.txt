I use Jupyter notebooks all the time. I use them to author the content for articles like the one you’re reading. I use them to explore data. And I use them whenever I want to prototype standalone modules or learn new programming concepts, since notebooks allow us to quickly iterate on new ideas and provide powerful ways introspect, profile, and debug code - and more.

I’ve recently become interested in Python’s new typing module and mypy, and I wanted to be able to use them seamlessly in the context of my Jupyter notebooks. IPython (the project that bridges Jupyter and Python) allows us to alter the behavior of a code cell through the use of “magics” - lines that begin with % for a single-line magic or %% for magics that work over multiple lines.

So I wanted my own custom magic to do 4 things.

Since my IPython configuration file has the following lines

which tells IPython to print the repr for any object which has its own line, I want to ensure this behavior is respected by my magic command.

You can find your own IPython configuration file using the command . If you don’t yet have a profile, you can create a default one with .

The code it took to do this is really straightforward, but it took some digging around in the Jupyter and IPython docs to get it to work as I wanted. Hopefully you find it useful and elucidating.|||
