3 years ago, I started to learn programming with no background (C course in college doesn’t count with a grade of DD). There were always some online courses from some universities, but I always believed that I should learn by doing. That’s why I signed up for Treehouse and had my first course about Objective-C…

The course, interface, examples that Treehouse covered were amazing. You can also practice Objective-C on your browser (you don’t need a Mac) but I understood nothing.

After trying a couple of more times, I just stopped for a while like everyone else.

Then i gave another try, then another, and another. Here is the list of courses I had taken:)

After all, publishing my first iOS app took 2 years of continuous learning and 1 month of developing. After publishing my first app beta, I decided to share one way of realistic learning path (for iOS development) so other people with no programming background can follow a track without losing time.

Sorry but you should start with learning the fundamentals. This course is a must (especially Javascript part) for learning basic algorithms.

This course covers everything (almost) you need about iOS development.

Understand basic concepts in a more visual way.

Appcoda has very useful tutorials and you can actually learn the basic versions of very complex apps. These two are my favorites:

If you already have your app idea, just take a glance at the tutorials here. I am sure you will find the guidance you need.

Bonus: If you want to go further, learn web development and back-end as well, this one will be a good start: Full Stack Web Development — Coursera.
