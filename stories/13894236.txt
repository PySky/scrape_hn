This is a simulator for Knuth's MIX machine from the book Art of Computer Programming. We use the identifier 1010 because this machine is slightly different from MIX 1009. We encode masks using binary and there is no division or multiplication instructions. A detailed readme and instruction list can be found on github.

Statements in the assembler language look like (:label) (/mask) (instruction) (relative address) (+index). Instuctions in memory look like address(:label) (/mask) (instruction) (address) (+index). Here is an example multiplication routine:

Here is a variant of this routine which is self modifying:

Here is an example where we loop through a zero terminated array and increment each entry by 1:

Here is an example where we compute the maximum in an array of numbers.

Here is an example where we add up all the numbers on a stack:

We can expand this example out into a programmable stack calculator with addition and multiplication operations:

here is an example where we traverse a binary tree with an integer stored at each node and increment those integers.|||
