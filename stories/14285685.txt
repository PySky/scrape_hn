This is a quick hack demonstrating how to create WebKit/Safari files, inspired by pocket-archive-stream.

is the native web page archive format on the Mac, and is essentially a serialized snapshot of Safari/WebKit state. On a Mac, these files are Spotlight-indexable and can be opened by just about anything that takes a "webpage" as input.

Despite the rising prominence of WARC as the standard web archiving format (which to this day requires plug-ins to be viewable on a browser) I quite like , and built this in order to both demonstrate how to use it and have a minimally viable archive creator I can deploy as a service.

The file format is a nested binary , with roughly the following structure:

So creating a turns out to be fairly straightforward if you simply build a with the right structure and then serialize it using (which works on any platform).

The only hitch would be (which uses a rather more complex way to encode the HTTP result headers), but fortunately that appears not to be necessary at all.|||
