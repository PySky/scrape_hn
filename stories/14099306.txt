I’ve had a lot of trouble picking a JS UI library because there are too many options Angular, React, Ember, VueJS, and so many others but I had to choose one, so my first choice was the most popular then… Angular, but it wasn’t for me.

Then I started catching up with my Twitter feed and found React, everyone was making a lot of good comments, and I thought it might be the new boom. Then the Thought Works Radar for November 2016 came out and there it was… React in the Adopt section… that was the drop of water that fell out of the glass. Right away I started reading like crazy the React official documentation and started a little project with it… didn’t like it… didn’t finish it.

After that, I started to look new ideas for side projects and found a site that gathers lots of tweets with ideas, and this one attracted my attention:

Since I wanted to learn React, I coded Challnge me!. Yeah... the name is missing an ‘e,’ I wanted to have like something different. It’s pretty simple. You sign up, pick your favorite categories and it will challenge you. After you complete the challenge, you can share it on Twitter and keep your awesome memories of every challenge you’ve completed.

For me, well, I had my challenge to complete to share my experience with you, and it was to Learn React, at least the basics.|||
