Tim Berners-Lee famously tweeted the simple phrase “This is for Everyone” at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in my home town of London in 2012. His words were lit up throughout the entire stadium and transmitted to millions of people watching around the world.

It’s an inspirational statement, and I think its legacy will probably eclipse much of what happened at that event, the message only being really understood decades from now. By coming up with such a world-changing idea as the Web, and rather than patenting it, releasing it for anyone to use, he set in motion a series of events that have changed much of every-day life for many of us. And because it’s all free, we can all, within reason get involved.

There’s a clever play on words at the heart of the statement, dependent upon your emphasis: “This is for everyone”, as in, it’s a gift that Tim, the inventor, gave to the world; or perhaps “This is for everyone”, which implies that anyone, irrespective of how they might describe themselves, can be involved.

I think that we still have a way to go if it’s the latter.|||
