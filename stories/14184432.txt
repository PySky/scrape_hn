Redux is a Flux-like state container for React and other JavaScript libraries. Redux marks a departure from classic Facebook Flux in important ways. First, it doesn't use a Dispatcher. Neither does it make use of multiple stores. Instead, Redux uses one store which holds all the state, and has multiple reducers that work with different parts of your state tree. The Redux approach borrows heavily from Elm and has proven to be very popular among fans of functional JavaScript programming and FP in general. It's safe to say Redux is one of the pillar projects you'll want to know about if you're working in the React ecosystem.

React-Redux provides the official React bindings for Redux, enabling you to use Redux with React.|||
