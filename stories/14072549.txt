The characters created by the two comic book geniuses Albert Uderzo and René Goscinny are back!

Famous for their extensive travels around the Known World, this time Asterix and Obelix are going to meet the people of the Italian peninsula: the Italics!

To Obelix's delight, the inhabitants of Ancient Italy are not all Romans! Far from it! The Italics want to keep their independence and take a dim view of Julius Caesar and his Legions' plans for total domination.

In Asterix and the Race through Italy, Asterix and Obelix embark upon a great adventure in the extraordinary world of Ancient Italy!|||
