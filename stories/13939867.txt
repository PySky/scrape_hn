Three key insights you need to have if you’re ever gonna figure out how to not be a loser and make at least a decent six figure income:

If you produce no value, you should expect no value in return. Indeed, for people with no hard skills, it’s not a matter of “if” you will lose your job, it’s a matter of “when.”

Here is where the higher education institutions have failed us. They make us jump through hoops for 4 years, wasting 90-95% of our time on bullshit that does not produce economic value for anyone. And all the while we swallow their bullshit with gusto under the excuse that “an education is invaluable,” or “this is an investment.”

Sure, an education is invaluable. But you can get an education for $15 a month on audible.com. If you’re gonna be in $80k of debt you better be damn sure you’re learning a hard skill that can produce value for employers. This is something that’s simply not available in most colleges, so you’re gonna have to do research and find somewhere like Full Sail, General Assembly, or TechLaunch (my employer) where it’s actually possible to learn worthwhile things.|||
