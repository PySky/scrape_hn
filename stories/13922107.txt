Public knowledge by now but AMD has a new HEDT platform coming out in a couple of months

 You'll see more of it at Computex I believe.

 It's a 16 core /32 Thread, quad channel behemoth. And it is insanely quick in the tests that Ryzen is already excelling at. So Cinebench, and all other related productivity programs. The gaming issues that were causing the Ryzen AM4 CPUs to behave erratically to say the least have been ironed out. It's akin to a newer revision on a newer platform. This should be competing with the Xeon and of course 6950X Intel offers for $1700~$1800USD, but at about $1,000 USD if not less for some Skews. Coming soon.

 CPSs are pretty big physically, about twice the size of surrent 6950X CPUs and a bit more perhaps.

 And if you were hoping for pins, nope it's strictly LGA!

 IT's NOT 8 channel, but Quad.

Yesterday I posted from my source talk of a new platform, today Chiphell leaked the X399 which my source confirmed is real.Will be a splendid competition between X299 and this AMD platform. Skylake-X is pretty good, not revolutionary but a meaningful step up in IPC and the clocks are pretty high as well. If Intel will have a 32 core part to compete on X299 remains to be seen, but the HEDT platform is going to change quite a bit in the next 4 to 6 months.I did confirm that the new silicon rivisions with "ironed" out issues is all the way from these behemoths to the entry level SKU's, I am not really getting my knickers in abunch about this anymore, performance is coming but only if you haven't bought a chip yet.|||
