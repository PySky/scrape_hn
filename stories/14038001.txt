The world of streaming open data needs help. Right now, that data is accessible only by going to numerous websites all over the internet. This creates a painful experience for developers who want to access different data sources. Since each source handles data differently, the number of developers who actually use the data to build amazing apps is greatly reduced.

Satori coalesces that streaming open data into live open data channels. Developers only have to learn one API then use any of our SDKs to tap into world's streaming live open data and create amazing apps - all for free.

We're leveling the playing field when it comes to streaming open data.|||

Satori is the live data ecosystem changing the future with live data. Moving computation onto the network and building the worldâ€™s biggest stateless computer.
