Mac users, please read the known issues part before installing the package.

Local.dev offers you a simple command line to improve your node workflow by providing easy and persistant port forwading on localhost.

Did you already struggled to remember all of those localhost:port that you juste create ? Or don't you want to rename the boring localhost:8080 to whatever.dev ? Because I did !

With local.dev, you can rename any localhost:port to any name possible, you don't even need to add a domain dot if you don't feel like it.

Every command can be made with instead of .

Add a new local.dev url. You will need the root priviliges for this one

List all of your local.dev active

The local.dev is reset if the mac shutdown.

To set it again, you have to delete it first with . It's a work in progress for this one, I have to find a good solution to edit the pf.conf file.

Mutliple local.dev doesn't work on mac, still a problem with pf.conf.

Renaming only one localhost at a time makes this package useless on Mac, I wouldn't recommend using it for the moment. Work in progress.|||
