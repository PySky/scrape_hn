It might be wise to look away now if you are eating or have a weak stomach, but scientists have discovered that ingesting bogies is good for teeth, and overall health.

Scientists at a number of universities including Harvard and the University of Saskatchewan and say parents should not discourage their children from picking their noses because they contain 'a rich reservoir of good bacteria.'

Eating snot can also prevent bacteria from sticking to teeth, according to the article published in the journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

The findings even suggest snot could defend against respiratory infections, stomach ulcers and even HIV.

The researchers are even working on a synthetic mucus toothpaste and chewing gum to harness the dental benefits of bogies.|||
