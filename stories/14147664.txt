In canvassing the security industry, CBInsights came up with a list of startups with early-to mid-stage high-momentum that have pioneering technology with the potential to transform cybersecurity. They split the companies into the following categories: Quantum Encryption, Predictive Intelligence, Deception Security, Autonomous Systems, IoT Security, Mobile Security, Automobile Security, Critical Infrastructure Security, and Cyber Insurance.

CB Insights created a Company Mosaic, which uses data to track private company health, using signals including recency of financing, total raised, and investor quality. We’ve gathered this data via our machine learning technology (dubbed The Cruncher) as well as via several thousand direct submissions from firms and  individual professionals.|||
