Earlier it was really difficult for people who own a company, organization or personal domain name to manage email in a neat way as the email provided by web host is not really up to the mark. So the easy way for them was to use Gmail (as it is neat and easy to manage) but they had to use CompanyName@gmail.com, which doesn’t look professional and in addition, it also looks like they are promoting Gmail instead of their own domain.

But now Google has come up with G Suite, which is easy to use and allow you to use your custom email address with your domain name to access Gmail and doesn’t charge much for it.

If you are still in any doubts about using Gmail custom email address for your own domain. You can ask your question below at comment section.
