Hi! In case you missed the memo, MomoCupid is an April Foolsâ€™ joke created by the folks at MomoCentral.

Sadly enough, we have not, in fact, set out to tackle the noble problem of Geeky Love (yet?). If however you happen to be after a talented geek or two for some real (less amorous) work, do drop by MomoCentral.com!

Shoutout meanwhile to our amazing, diverse (and very date-able!) geek friends and talents worldwide!|||
