I was very impressed that, once completed, the data is searchable! We have hundreds of PDF's coming in every month so it's really handy to be able to find the PDF and information we need in seconds.

Some of our customers find filling out PDF documents daunting as they don't know how to download or use the appropriate software, which is why we choose to use PlatoForms. Our customers don't even know they're filling out a PDF!

I could never find a service that allowed you to keep the original PDF design while converting it into an online form, which is where PlatoForms excel. It makes monitoring customer responses quick and easy, too, as we don't have to search our inbox for attachments.|||

PlatoForms is an online drag & drop form builder used for converting any non-editable, non-fillable, even a scanned image PDF form to normal web page forms.
