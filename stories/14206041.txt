At Joynture, we try to shed as many of the steely workplace characteristics as we can. Instead, we promote a community of professionals from all walks of life that share diverse insights into a broad range of subjects and work alongside each other to do great things. We want above all to see our members succeed and truly believe a healthy professional community is an essential tool for progress. No profession takes precedence here at Joynture, and the estranged coworker is a thing of the past!|||
