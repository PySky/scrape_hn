Microsoft appears to be launching a Surface Laptop at its event in New York City tomorrow. Twitter user WalkingCat has shared several images of what is reportedly simply just "Surface Laptop," and it looks like Microsoft's answer to Google's Chromebook Pixel. The Surface Laptop will reportedly include a 13.5-inch PixelSense display and ship in four colors: platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold.

Microsoft's laptop will also include an alcantara keyboard, the same fabric used on the premium Surface Pro 4 keyboard option. It's not clear what processor and other hardware power the Surface Laptop, but the images show that there will be a regular USB port, mini DisplayPort, and the conventional Surface power connector. Microsoft doesn't appear to be adopting USB Type-C ports for its Surface Laptop.

The Surface Laptop will also reportedly weigh 2.76 pounds, with a thickness of 14.47mm at the back and 9.9mm at the front. Microsoft's display is said to include 3.4 million pixels, which suggests that the company is using a 1080p panel for what looks like a 3:2 aspect ratio display at 13.5 inches.

WalkingCat also claims the Surface Laptop will also run Windows 10 S, a rumored name for Microsoft's Chrome OS alternative. We're expecting Microsoft to detail this new version of Windows 10 tomorrow, including its ability to only run Windows Store apps. We'll have to wait until tomorrow for the full details from Microsoft, but this Surface Laptop looks like a premium alternative to the Chromebook Pixel. It's likely that Microsoft will position this hardware as the high end for its new efforts with Windows 10 S.|||
