Date and time are one of the most important aspects which every coder has to deal with in Ruby. Well, let’s get to know how we keep it up alive and functional.

 There are 3 different classes in Ruby that handles date and time. They are Date, Time and DateTime. Date and DateTime classes are both from date library. And Time class from its own time library.

In this article we’ll see how Date and Time works. Let’s have a look at each one of them.

When you need a string format of year, month and day, you have to go through Date class.

If you need both date and time values, we can make use of Time class.

Also rails provide a really good time class called ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone. It contains all the features the Time class have, plus many improvements, such as the support for configurable time zones.

Now since we know so many facets of Date, Time and DateTime , we can use them in a much better manner in future at our time of needs.|||
