The idea behind this little project is don't procrastinate on HN and never miss a story, job, or project I'm interested in. You can fetch all new stories, or stories containing particular terms in the title. To define term, you can use plain text or regular expressions. SQLite 3 is used to store fetched stories. You will never get the same story for the same term twice.

Program uses never-ending for{} cycle with pause between cycles, default pause is 30 minutes according to HN robots.txt. Please don't abuse HN :)

Configuration is stored in hnwatch.cfg file. Currently there is only configuration for sending e-mail alerts.

SQLite3 database file hnwatch.db is created automatically on the first run of the application
