QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROXY MATERIALS AND OUR ANNUAL MEETING

Our business affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors, which is currently composed of ten members. All of our directors, other than Mr. Dorsey, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Kordestani, our Executive Chairman, are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE). Our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors each serving a staggered three-year term. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors is elected for a three-year term to succeed the class whose term is then expiring.

The following table sets forth the names, ages as of March 31, 2017, and certain other information for each of the members of our board of directors with terms expiring at the Annual Meeting (who are also nominees for election as a director at the Annual Meeting) and for each of the continuing members of our board of directors. Peter Fenton, a current member of our board of directors, will not be standing for at the Annual Meeting. Full biographical information is below.

Board Leadership Structure and Role of Our Lead Independent Director

Board Leadership Structure and Role of Our Lead Independent Director

We believe that the structure of our board of directors and its committees provides strong overall management of our company.

We have maintained separate Executive Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer roles since October 2015, and we treat those positions as separate and distinct, with the distinct responsibilities as detailed in the examples below.

Each of the directors, other than Messrs. Dorsey and Kordestani, are independent. The board of directors believes that the independent directors provide effective oversight of management. In addition, our independent directors have appointed Ms. Scardino as our Lead Independent Director, a position she has held since May 2016 (replacing Mr. Currie, our former Lead Independent Director). As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Scardinos responsibilities include:

We believe this structure of a separate Executive Chairman of our board of directors and Chief Executive Officer, combined with a Lead Independent Director, enables each person to focus on different aspects of company leadership and reinforces the independence of our board of directors as a whole and results in an effective balancing of responsibilities, experience and independent perspective that meets the current business strategy and corporate governance needs and oversight responsibilities of our board of directors.

Stockholder Recommendations and Nominations to the Board of Directors

We believe that effective corporate governance should include regular, constructive conversations with our stockholders. During the past fiscal year, certain members of our board and members of our executive team have continued to engage with stockholders directly. Our board has also directed our management team to seek and encourage feedback from stockholders about our corporate governance practices by conducting additional stockholder outreach and engagement throughout the year. As a result, our management team reached out to our top institutional investors collectively holding approximately 23% of our shares outstanding and met with institutional investors holding approximately 18% of our shares outstanding to discuss our corporate governance and executive compensation programs and to answer questions and elicit feedback. These engagement efforts with our stockholders allowed us to better understand our stockholders priorities and perspectives, and provided us with useful input concerning our compensation and corporate governance practices. This effort generated important feedback for our compensation committee and the board of directors, and was taken into account when making decisions regarding compensation changes for our Named Executive Officers compensation. It also influenced actions by our board of directors on other corporate governance matters. A summary of the feedback received and the actions taken is set forth below:

While our board of directors is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, our board committees assist our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk, as summarized below. In addition, our full board of directors reviews strategic and operational risk in the context of reports from the management team, receives reports on all significant committee activities at each regular meeting, and evaluates the risks inherent in significant transactions.

The following table provides information regarding the total compensation that was earned by each of our directors in 2016.

The following table identifies certain information about our executive officers as of March 31, 2017. Our executive officers are appointed by, and serve at the discretion of, our board of directors. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) includes a detailed discussion of compensation for our current and former executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 who were Named Executive Officers (Named Executive Officers).

Our stockholder outreach efforts generated important feedback for our compensation committee and the full board of directors. A summary of the feedback received and the actions taken is set forth below:

. We established our compensation peers in October 2013 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Each year the compensation committee reviews the current compensation peers along with the selection criteria for applicability in making the next years compensation decisions. The compensation peers, used to inform 2016 compensation decisions, were selected using four general selection parameters. The criteria are software (primary) and broad technology (secondary) companies located in the United States which are between one half (0.5x) and two and one half (2.5x) times our size in revenue with a market capitalization of one third (0.3x) to three (3.0x) times our market capitalization with a preference for companies with high growth and high market capitalization to revenue multiples. We also consider cash and equity compensation data for Facebook, given we directly compete for key talent with Facebook, in order to better represent the current competitive and talent environment. In making 2016 peer group determinations, the compensation committee reviewed the recommendations provided by Compensia based on the criteria described above and removed Groupon, due to industry; Tesla, due to industry and financials; and Yahoo, due to sale of business, and to add Autodesk, Electronic Arts and Red Hat . Accordingly, the compensation peers used to inform 2016 compensation decisions were:

Our executive compensation program is comprised of three components, listed in order of importance:

The following chart sets forth the relative weight of 2016 compensation attributable to equity compensation and base salary for our Named Executive Officers on average as a group (excluding our CEO who declined all compensation).

The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis provided above. Based on its review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and Twitters Annual Report on Form for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The following table sets forth information regarding grants of plan-based equity awards made to our Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2016. We did not grant any plan-based cash awards or stock options to our Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2016.

The following table lists all outstanding equity awards held by our Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2016. These equity amounts have been adjusted, as applicable, to reflect, (i) a forward stock split completed in May 2010 and (ii) a forward stock split completed in May 2011. See the section titled Executive CompensationCompensation TablesPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control for information regarding the impact of certain employment termination scenarios on outstanding equity awards.

The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock acquired during 2016 by our Named Executive Officers upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSU and PRSU awards and the value realized upon such exercise or vesting.

assist to maximize stockholder value and maintain executive focus in the immediate period prior to, during and after the Change of Control event. We do not have any requirement to make payments simply based on the occurrence of a Change of Control (single trigger provisions). The Severance Policy does include a double trigger provision meaning that both a Change of Control and termination of employment must occur for the participant to receive the benefit. The material terms of these post-employment arrangements are set forth below, but generally each of our Named Executive Officers who signs and does not revoke our standard separation agreement and release of claims, which currently includes disparagement and confidentiality conditions in connection with an Involuntary Termination of employment would be entitled to benefits, as specified in the participation agreement between that eligible employee and Twitter, as follows: (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to 100% of such eligible employees annual base salary in connection with a Change of Control, and a lump sum severance payment equal to 100% of such eligible employees annual base salary not in connection with a Change of Control, (ii) payment for up to 12 months under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) premiums to continue health insurance coverage for such eligible employee and his or her eligible dependents that were covered under our healthcare plan in connection with a Change of Control, and 6 months of such premiums upon a qualifying employment termination not in connection with a Change of Control, and (iii) acceleration of vesting of 50% (or 100% in the case of our COO/CFO and Executive Chairman) of the shares underlying all unvested equity awards held by such eligible employee immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination in connection with a Change of Control, and at least 12.5% for all eligible employees (including Twitters COO/CFO and Executive Chairman) for a qualifying employment termination not in connection with a Change of Control. The compensation committee reviews the equity acceleration percentage for each participant and will adjust as and when necessary to align with peer company practices.

Each Named Executive Officer is entitled to receive amounts earned during the term of employment regardless of the manner of termination. These amounts include accrued base salary and other employee benefits to which the Named Executive Officer was entitled on the date of termination, and are not shown in the table below.

The following table gives information about shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of options, warrants and rights under all of our existing equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2016, including our Twitter, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan). No warrants are outstanding under any of the foregoing plans. We refer to these plans collectively as our Equity Compensation Plans.

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock as the Record Date for:

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and thus it represents sole or shared voting or investment power with respect to our securities. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where applicable.

We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership on 729,753,976 shares of our common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. We have deemed shares of our common stock subject to stock options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the Record Date or issuable pursuant to RSUs and PRSUs which are subject to vesting conditions expected to occur within 60 days of the Record Date to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the stock option, RSU or PRSU for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, California 94103. The information provided in the table is based on our records, information filed with the SEC and information provided to us, except where otherwise noted.
