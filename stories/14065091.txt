Nice! I've been dying to get my hands on a cheap 11-12" laptop, but there's nothing out there that isn't either a piece of crap with an 768p TN screen, 2GB of RAM, and dual-core Braswell Celeron that's literally too slow to do anything, or a $1000 Ultrabook... which all seem to have 13" screens. I've been waiting for years for someone to make something between the Asus E200HA and the XPS 13, and finally there's an option!|||
