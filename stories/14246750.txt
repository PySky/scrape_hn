As the media industry fights to stay on top, the need to investigate alternative business models and evaluating emerging technologies becomes increasingly self-evident. Media companies seeking to innovate in these disruptive surroundings will have to pay close attention to emerging innovation areas and the startups that are driving this disruptive digitalization. 50% of all spending in media will be dedicated to digital affairs by 2019, a clear indicator that digitalization is the single most important innovation area actively shaping the media industry.

As innovation is our business, cutting-edge startups are the focus of our attention. At StartUs Insights, our unit dedicated to Innovation Scouting and Open Innovation, we conducted a detailed analysis of 30.000+ European startups and consequently discovered several innovation areas which will alter the media ecosystem in the years to come. To shed light on the application and potential of the most disruptive of these technologies, we decided to outline the six most dominant innovation areas that influence the entire industry. As our focus lies on emerging startups, we provide one as an example for each innovation area in order to engender a better understanding and highlight existing cooperation potential.|||
