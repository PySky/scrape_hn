Humans will not alwa ys be the most intelligent

agents on Earth, the ones steering the fu ture. What

will happen to us when we no longer play that role,

and how can we prepar e for this transition?

The human level of intelligence is an evolutionary acci-

If we w ere visited by extr aterr estrials, these beings would

There is, of course, a risk in passing control of the future

to machines, for they may not share our values. This risk is

increased by two factors that may cau se the transition from|||
