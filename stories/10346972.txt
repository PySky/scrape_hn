 Can’t get enough of the sound the rain makes when it hits your roof at night?  It’s a soothing sound to most of us that reminds us a nature’s form of music, soothing us like a lullaby.  Well, what if you could actually create a home that made music when it rained?  This Kunsthofpassage Funnel Wall in Germany does just that, a funky colored house with pipes and tiles that look strange to the untrained eye.  When it rains, however, the uses come clear, and you can hear the beautiful melody that the drops make as they spiral down into the pipes, tiles, and tunnels.  It’s a beautiful sight to see and attracts many visitors far and wide. If you are interested in nature and/or music, this is a sight that must be seen.  If you lived here, you’d get a whole new appreciation for the sound of the rain as you sleep.  If you can keep from tapping your toes, that is!|||
