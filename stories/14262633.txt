With less than four months of the first anniversary of Android Nougat confirms that its expansion goes to full pace after these last three very good months.

Its distribution has picked up rhythm after about six first months in which it was hardly advancing.

With the new distribution of Android versions that Google just published with the data updated as of May 2, we see as Android Nougat grows more than 2% in another month, already surpassing 7% of the devices.

The growth of Android Nougat is going to be unstoppable over the next few months thanks to the updates and the new generation of devices that come to market with this factory version, such as LG G6 or Samsung Galaxy S8.

The May distribution has left us a surprise.

There is a small rebound in two previous versions of the operating system. Android 2.3 Gingerbread goes from 0.9% to 1% and Android 5.1 Lollipop from 23.0% to 23.3%.

The reason for this strange rebound was unknown when it was many months ago, or years in the case of Gingerbread, that only lost market share.

Android Marshmallow is staked for the first time in the distribution staying at 31.2% and as the second version of the most used operating system, behind Android Lollipop with 32%.

The third most used version also remains Android 4.4 KitKat now with 18.8% share compared to 20% last month.

Next, I leave you with the complete table of the current panorama of the distribution fragmentation alias of Android.|||
