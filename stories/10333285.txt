We are happy to announce that Fastly has offered their worldwide CDN network to provide fast download services for Linux kernel releases, which should improve download speeds for those of you located outside North America. We have modified the front page to offer CDN-powered download links, but all the existing URLs should continue to work.

If you would like to avoid using Fastly, you can simply change the URL to have "www.kernel.org" instead of "cdn.kernel.org". As always, please use PGP Signature Verification for all downloaded files regardless of where you got them.|||
