This week few things happened in JavaScript world. Next.js 2.0 and Apollo 1.0 have been announced. React keeps getting more popular. Iâ€™m looking for presenters at our next GraphQL NY meetup (ping me on twitter if interested).

Next.js 2.0 has been announced this week. This is a great opportunity to start learning how to build SSR enabled apps with React.js and Next.js.

React is taking over, thatâ€™s obvious. Great overview the benefits of using React and some core concepts of libraryâ€™s internal parts.

Apollo 1.0 has been announced. Now itâ€™s a stable and production-ready client-side library that leverages the power of a GraphQL API to handle data fetching and management for you.

Redux Offline aims to give a granular degree of control to all aspects of the offline-first experience. This includes how to orchestrate network-resilient API calls, how to persist your state, how to batch messages, and how to handle errors, retries, optimistic UI updates, migrations, cache pruning, and more.

Creating chess AI game in JavaScript? Yes, itâ€™s possible. There is even live demo of this tutorial in JSFiddle. Simply awesome!

Iâ€™ve used docker few times but havenâ€™t realized full potential until recently. In addition to Node.js apps, now Iâ€™m running WordPress in Docker too (why not). This podcast is a good discussion around Docker.
