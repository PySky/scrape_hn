Decades of psychological research into human memory has confirmed something that most of us know intuitively: no matter how interesting or useful, we forget facts, faces, terms, and concepts that we only occassionally encounter. Mem& makes it possible to continuously review everything that you want to retain just before you forget it.

But if you review the material within 24 hours, most people retain 90% of it for about a week before starting to forget again.

Every time you correctly recall information, you remember it for longer. Mem& uses a mixture of proprietary technologies and a well-studied technique called spaced repetition to intelligently schedule reviews so that you only review information that you are about to forget. Every time you correctly remember a note, we wait longer before reviewing it with you again.

For example, the blue dots on the calendar might represent the Chinese vocabulary term 你好, meaning hello. If you answer it correctly right after inputing it into Mem&, then we will review it again the next day. If you answer it correctly again, then you don’t need to review it again for a few days. If you continue answering it correctly, we will wait even longer before presenting it to you again.

The other colored dots represent other notes that you are reviewing with Mem&. The brown dot represents a note that you find pretty easy to remember. The green dot shows a note that you initially struggle with but then master. As the dots become more opaque, the Mem& algorithm becomes more confident that you will remember the term in short term.

If this all seems a little confusing, don’t worry—you don’t need to understand the science in its entirety to start remembering everything you learn using Mem&. The Mem& app makes it incredibly easy to enter notes and review them daily. Just tap here to get started.|||
