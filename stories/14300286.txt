Making calls with Alexa is easy. Once you’ve synced your contacts in the Alexa App, just ask Alexa to place a call.

Alexa will let you know when someone is calling, and a green light ring will appear on your supported Echo device. You can ask Alexa to answer or ignore the call.

With Echo Show, you’ll also be able to make video calls or use Drop In, a new feature for the special cases when you want to connect instantly with your closest family and friends.|||

With Alexa you can use your Echo device to call or message anyone with a supported Echo device or the Alexa App on their phone—for free.
