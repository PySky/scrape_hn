Welcome to the latest edition of our newest weekly blog series, Simple Website Fixes. Each week we will identify and explain one easy change that you can make to your company’s website in order to improve performance. Last week’s fix was – Use Shorter Forms.

Content used to be king. Some will argue that it still is.

Regardless of who is right and who is wrong, there can be no arguing that producing quality content is an important piece of the marketing mix for most companies. And if you’re not currently writing content for your website, that is an easy solution to help you grow your reach and improve the performance of your site.

Posting content to your site in the form of articles, blog posts, images, infographics, or videos helps you in a few ways. First, they act as a means of drawing in potential customers. Using them as fodder on social media and getting them indexed by search engines means people are more likely to click through to your website and engage with your brand.

Second, they can help establish your expertise in the marketplace. Content is a way to showcase what you know, and to educate the consumer, making it more likely that they choose you over your competition.

And finally, content is a great way to keep people on your site once they get there. They may not immediately find what they are looking for, or they may not be ready just yet to complete a purchase, but content gives them a reason not to leave. The longer they interact with your site, the more likely they are to purchase from you in the long run.

If your website is light on content, that should be your first area of improvement.
