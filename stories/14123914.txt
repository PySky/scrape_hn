President Trump’s decision to muzzle key areas of scientific research signals an important milestone. The latest battle in the War on Science has shifted into high gear.

Attacks on science might sound trivial compared to the larger political upheaval happening in America today, but make no mistake: the War on Science is going to affect you, whether you are a scientist or not.
