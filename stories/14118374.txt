TidyTabs adds tabs to most Windows programs (no UWP unfortunately). While it's not built-in to WindowsÂ and doesn't look as nice, it works very well. I'm hoping that keyboard shortcuts will be added in the near future so I can use the extra buttons on my mouse to switch between tabs.

Also check out AquaSnap if you're a fan of tiling windows and want to improve upon Window's Aero Snap.|||

Microsoft is experimenting with bringing the browser tabbing experience to all apps in Windows 10, including File Explorer.
