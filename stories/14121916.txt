Technological advancement is seeing an exponential growth lately, with each generation having access to successively more advanced technology.

Our parents didn’t have the internet — now we can send data using light beams.

Their parents had even less.

Soon, technology could be seeing major improvements within a matter of months.

So the question that you will have to answer, when the time comes, is:

In that case, I believe it would be best to fight fire with fire and upload ourselves to take advantage of a robot frame. In that case, I think we should all plug in and become AI.|||

Scientists and leading tech pioneers have predicted (for quite a while now) that some time in the future, humans will be able to ‘plug in’ their brain to a computer, and effectively become a robot…
