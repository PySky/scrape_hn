Slim.js is a lightweight web component library that provides extended capabilities for components, such as data binding, using es6 native class inheritance. This library is focused for providing the developer the ability to write robust and native web components without the hassle of dependencies and an overhead of a framework.

Please note: Target browsers that do not support web component are required to use a polyfill like web-components

Every slim.js component has it's own default template to be rendered upon placed on the DOM tree. This template is accessible via a template getter function.

Usage of the element in another template or in a HTML wrapper:

Slim.js supports one-way data binding to inner text, attributes, directly or via a parsing methods.

Text binding is used with the bind attribute

Attribute binding is done in a same manner, only the bind attribute is not required.

You could wrap a binding with a parsing method, thus enforcing parser method to run every change in the property|||
