So I noticed this the other day. I had a Driver cancel on me (I don't know the reason I assume heavy traffic). Uber has a clause that if you cancel after 5 mins of making the booking, you pay $10. However I did not cancel - the driver did and yet Uber still tried to charge me $10. Now there is no way Uber would not be tracking that variable that indicates it was the driver who cancelled and not me... I went to their site and after searching and searching - finally found the place where I can dispute it (literally a link saying "the driver cancelled") and I was credited $10 straight away (again there was no dispute process - they knew they had ripped me off). So I think this is basically them trying to scam people who don't have the time to dispute transactions (and they really bury it making it very hard to find)... and also a lot of corporate accounts would simply get milked by this dodgy functionality. Whats more is that they don't refund the money they took unlawfully - instead they credit it to your Uber account. Has anyone else found this? How are they getting away with this? As much as I prefer Uber to taxis... it must be an unlawful practice.|||
