I've put out a so far 13-part series on creating a self driving vehicle with Grand Theft Auto 5.

A brief taste of what we're doing

..or check out the latest video in the series: a more interesting self-driving AI, especially near the end.

This is by no means a serious look into self-driving vehicles, it's just for fun, and so far the latest project has been to make a motorcycle that speeds through traffic, attempting to stay on the road and evading all the other slow drivers.

We do all of this with basic(ish...) tools and concepts. We're reading the screen by taking screenshots with pywin32, seeing about 20 FPS with the neural network, sending keys with direct input, and then doing some analysis with OpenCV, otherwise also training with a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

The goal of the series is more to show you how you can take just about whatever game you want, mapping the screen to inputs, training a neural network, and then letting the network play the game.

It's an ongoing project, and is also open-source

Here's a link to the self-driving tutorials, which starts at the beginning. We start to use the neural network in part 9

That's all for now, more AI in GTA to come.|||
