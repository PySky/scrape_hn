Starting with breathtaking aerial footage of the Scottish Highlands, this follows your whiskey’s journey from barley field, to distillery, and all the way to Covent Garden – where it’s served up to you in the hotel’s Lobby Bar.

Award-winning bartender Pedro Paulo will ensure that The Origin is served up as you take off your VR goggles.

Be prepared to pay out for this showmanship however – the cocktail will cost you £18 ($23).|||

Pairing your beverage with VR experience is now a thing.
