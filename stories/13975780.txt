 Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c (“backtracks”) as soon as it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a “partial candidate solution” and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution. Backtracking is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test.
