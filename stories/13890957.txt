With all the hooplah around proposed immigration laws and national security, it seems some people have forgotten what constitutes an actual, legitimate threat to their existences. Allow me to remind you...

Song Lyrics:

Shark bites in oceans

And asteroids from deep space

Sting from a hornet or bee right on your face

Lightning from Zeus because that’s a thing, too

These will kill you before terrorists do



Bus, train or streetcar at big intersections

Earthquakes or wild dogs

Or lethal injections

Storms and tornadoes while you’re in the loo

These will kill you before terrorists do



Sharp knives in kitchens and bare copper wires

Smoke inhalation from random house fires

Cops who shoot first and then claim it’s not true

These will kill you before terrorists do



When you lose it

When you spew hate

When you get all mad

You spoil all the things that make humans so great

And then you are just as bad



Choking on food

Or the forces of nature

Some rando coming at you with a razor

Ingesting some kind of poisonous brew

These will kill you before terrorists do



Airplanes and spaceships and fast motorcycles

Walking and falling at checkout in Michaels

Suicide rates have skyrocketed, too

These will kill you before terrorists do



Heart failure, cancer and driving while sleepy

Lung issues, Alzheimers, and Diabetes

Climate change gives zero fucks about you

These will kill you before terrorists do



When you lose it

When you spew hate

When you get all mad

You spoil all the things that make humans so great

And then you are just as bad
