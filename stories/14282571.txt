The Economic Policy Institute analyzed how the great recession has impacted young people's employment rates. Over the past year, there has been a growing unemployment gap between young men and young women. In 2016, the unemployment rate for women continued to decrease, while unemployment for men has worsened.

Head scratcher: Elise Gould, one of the study's authors, tells Axios that although there's a smaller percentage of women participating in the workforce, the share of those employed is higher for women than for men. "I can't think of any other population group where that is true," Gould said. 



One big reason for fewer women participating in the workforce is motherhood or even older women caring for their parents. But, as Gould hypothesized, 21-24 year olds are far less likely to have kids.
