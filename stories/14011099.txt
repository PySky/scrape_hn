Tiny Lens is a small, portable clip-on lens for iPhone. The optical design is truly revolutionary. We combined years of image compression research with advanced optical engineering. Legacy solutions use slow software to compress your images. Tiny Lens has image compression built right in!

The revolutionary Tiny Compression® optical coating (patent pending) blocks certain wavelengths, which reduces the number of bytes required to store your photos and videos. Two high precision synthetic zircon optical elements ensure a crystal clear image.

With Tiny Lens you will save up to 80% on your photo and video storage space – just imagine how many more videos of your cat you can take!

Tiny Lens is coming soon for iPhone 6, iPhone 6S and iPhone 7. It works with any iOS app – no software updates required.|||
