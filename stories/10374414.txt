No matter what kind of business you are running, as a business owner, you’re always aimed at growing your enterprise and increasing revenue. This, in its turn, frequently calls for new investments and extra staff to handle the growing volumes of work. The point here is, in order to get more profits you’ve got to find balance between how much you spend and how much you get back, otherwise your business may grow, but profits can remain the same or even be reduced.

The way to cut down spendings is to avoid hiring new staff members unless absolutely necessary. Instead, you can measure how productive your employees currently are and motivate them to work more efficiently, which will lead to an increase in profits.

The employees are the heart of virtually any organization. While with machines it’s easy to see the expected productivity level, with people it’s much harder to do. Some team members don’t need any extra motivation or monitoring to work at their full capacity. There are lots of employees, however, who work effectively only when supervised and controlled severely, otherwise they can simply create the appearance of working hard.

So, if you manage to make workers from the latter category diligently perform their duties, the amount of tasks done and their quality can seriously improve.

For companies where most staff work on computers, measuring employee productivity now doesn’t present any difficulty. Thanks to the time tracking apps, like Yaware.TimeTracker that are installed on the computers or iOS and Android devices, it’s easy to see who among your staff members is really working to the full and who has room for growth.

This tool is simple to implement and use, and it saves hours of work and tons of efforts to monitor employee working time. So, let’s see how helpful it is to benchmark the efficiency of your staff?

Once you’ve got a clear picture of your staff efficiency, you’ll know who requires special measures to be taken and who should be rewarded to keep going as is.

Generally, to keep your employees constantly growing their productivity and even competing to some extend, it’s recommended to set productivity goals for each department or employee to reach. In case of success, they should be rewarded (a reward system should be developed at the start). Failure would mean the necessity to review the adequacy of the goal itself along with the productivity and diligence of the staff member in question.

Organizing educative activities for the current staff is always the right investment, which helps employees refresh their knowledge, improve motivation and teach them deal with non-typical tasks faster.

It would be mistaken to think that once performance is measured and improved, monitoring is no longer needed. Tracking employee time on the constant basis is one of the conditions of successful time management and productivity growth.
