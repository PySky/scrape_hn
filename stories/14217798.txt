The way we access the internet has changed. With the growth of smartphones and mobile devices, we are seeing millions of people from around the world using the internet for the first time on a mobile device. Google is supporting Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to help developers provide native-app qualities in web applications that are reliable, fast, and engaging.

This course is aimed at:

This course shows you how to convert web pages to PWAs. A PWA is not an API or a technology, but it is a web development approach that uses a combination of tools and technologies already available to create targeted, ideal user experiences. It shows how to use service workers, APIs, and an application shell architecture for meaningful offline experiences, fast first load, and easy user reengagement upon repeat visits.

Our codelabs provide a guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience. Most codelabs step you through the process of adding a new feature to an existing application. The codelabs can be completed in any order. However, the more advanced codelabs build on the fundamentals covered in the earlier codelabs. Each codelab has the recommended prerequisites listed at the start.

Each codelab has an accompanying text that explains the concepts in the codelab in more detail. Links to corresponding texts are included at the top of each codelab.|||
