Not satisfied with simply dominating our digital needs, the global goliath is now on a mission to mix up your martini.

The startup hub Google Campus Warsaw has this week launched its very own vodka brand – named Old Style Flavoured Vodka.

The chameleon company is known for adapting each of its offices to fit the spirit (sorry, not sorry) of their locations, and Google vodka it seems is the perfect nod to the history of the Polish capital.

Google Campus Warsaw is even located in the Koneser complex, once home to a vast vodka distillery.|||

That's right. Google Campus Warsaw just launched its own Google vodka.
