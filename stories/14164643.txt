Reg Lecture Politics and society is about to get stranger and we're not even talking about what's going on in Westminster.

There's a host of secretive, influential, and tech-enabled movements coming your way whose plans to redesign society make Brexit look like tinkering around the edges.

Luckily for you Jamie Bartlett – author of The Dark Net – will be joining us on 23 May to talk about his upcoming book Radicals, which details the two years he spent embedded with the innovators, disruptors, idealists and extremists who think society is broken, and believe they know how to fix it.

The book, and Jamie's lecture, spans some of the most secretive and influential movements today: the US Transhumanist Party, far-right groups seeking to close the borders, militant environmentalists striving to save the planet's natural resources by any means possible, libertarian movements founding new countries, autonomous co-operatives in self-sustaining micro-societies, and psychedelic pioneers attempting to heal society with the help of powerful hallucinogens.

If you're interested in where society is heading, and how technology is helping it get there, you'll want to join us at the Yorkshire Grey on Theobalds Road, London, on 23 May. The doors will be open from 6pm, with the talk proper kicking off at 7. And yes, there'll be refreshments, both liquid and solid, on hand.

As always, we'll break for a drink and a bite after the talk, before opening the floor to questions, giving you the opportunity to really work out whether these new movements are chasing a dream, or dragging us all into a nightmare.

We'd love you to join us. You can buy your ticket here.

You can read more about Radicals, and place advanced orders, here.

And if you need reminding what a compelling speaker Jamie is, you can check out his last Reg lecture, when he discussed the Dark Net.|||
