If we invested as much time into learning a new skill as we do videogames, we could all be multilingual musical geniuses, says a new survey.

Bidvine.com polled 2,000 Brits and found that on average, they spent two hours a day on games – if that sounds high, don't forget it includes things like Pokémon Go and Candy Crush, which people often don't count as 'real games.' Plus of course there are the RPG poopsockers artificially inflating the average.

In that time, gamers could apparently learn French in six months, the guitar in three, or train for a marathon in just ten weeks. There's an online calculator so you can depress yourself finding out what you could have done with that time instead.

Bidvine.com co-founder Russ Morgan, clearly not a CoD fan, said:

"We really don’t want to shame people for gaming, because it’s a great way for people to unwind and have fun. We thought it would be interesting though, to find out in relative terms what could be achieved within the same timeframe. Gaming is such a popular leisure activity globally for both men and women, it made sense to use it as something to compare to, but members of the public can also apply the calculator to the amount of time they spend online or on social media as well. We hope that the calculator will encourage people to try something new, learn a new hobby and finally get round to ticking some things off of their bucket or to-do list. I think most don’t realise how little time you actually need to allocate to learning a new skill, just think, in six months’ time you could be sat in a restaurant speaking fluent French to your waiter!"

Alternatively, you could have completed Breath of the Wild, Horizon: Zero Dawn and Persona 5. We know which option we're choosing.|||
