It does not look that special right? The design is clean & Make website without build process might be its core selling points. (It does has a plugin system in case you wonder.)

So here I’m going to introduce another feature, combine the power of Markdown & Vue component:

Basically the option is similar to in many router libraries, it defines how the user enters a page, by default it fetches markdown file matches by the option, for example will fetch for you, but you can also use option to write inline markdown if your website isn’t that large.

The fetched content will be parsed by marked and rendered as simple HTML string. But if you use option which is a simple Vue component object, the parsed HTML string will be used as the component’s value, and we finally render the Vue component as a part of the app.|||

If you know Flatdoc you already know Docute, except that Docute supports multi-pages and has many more features. It does not look that special right? The design is clean & Make website without build…
