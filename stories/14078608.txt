Summaries are free, detailed, and high quality, and they incorporate other books and online resources related to the authors' points.Check out these two sites next if you don't have a particular book in mind. Actionable Books is user-friendly but not comprehensive; Derek Sivers' site is free-form notes rather than a summary, but contains a great deal of detail.My top choice for anyone who is willing to subscribe to a paid service. Large selection, very user friendly, high quality content, and by far the least expensive of all the paid options.A blog by Shane Parrish with excerpts from various books. This isn't really a book summary site, but I would assume the goal of most book summary readers is to learn the insights from various books as efficiently as possible.

Anyone can edit, so quality is a bit variable.: Five-minute VideoScribe videos. The compressed time frame and video format means that you won't get as much detail, but the videos are well-done and will give you the main points.$40/year. Very user-friendly format.: $29/month. You also get two free summaries up front, and it's $1 for the first month.: $29.99/month or $299.99/year.

Various other plans up to $695 for immediate access to up to 200 additional summaries.: Several different pricing plans, but it ends up being $2 - $3 per summary.
