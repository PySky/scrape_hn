Although the language had been out since 1998, for many years the most complex known programs was 'hello, world', available in several versions.

In 2004, based on the analysis below, I wrote a program that copied input to output, though it did not terminate properly on end of input.



There was a claim that the '99 bottles of beer' program had been written in Malbolge.  ( The site was (now dead): http://99-bottles-of-beer.ls-la.net/m.html)  The implication is that the program was doing looping, testing and printing.  However, closer examination shows that the programmer was just doing a printf("") of the desired result using straight line code.  Conceptually this is exactly the same as the 'hello world' example above.



This difficult task of writing a general program in Malbolge was completed for real in 2005 by  Hisashi Iizawa , Toshiki Sakabe, Masahiko Sakai , Keiichirou Kusakari, and Naoki Nishida.  Their paper "Programming Method in Obfuscated Language Malbolge" (in Japanese) can be found at http://www.sakabe.i.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~nishida/DB/pdf/iizawa05ss2005-22.pdf.  The resulting source code for '99 bottles of beer' can be found at: http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-malbolge-995.html .  Though some of the theory developed here was used, reducing this to practice was an amazing feat of programming prowess.

Looked at as a cryptosystem, it has several weaknesses:
