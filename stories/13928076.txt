Located only 15 miles from the Equator, we are excited to announce Cloudflare’s newest data center in the World Heritage City of Quito, Ecuador. This deployment is made possible in partnership with the NAP.EC Internet exchange run by AEPROVI (Asociación de empresas proveedoras de servicios de internet). Our newest data center expands Cloudflare’s growing Latin America network to six cities, joining Buenos Aires (Argentina), Lima (Peru), Medellin (Colombia), Sao Paulo (Brazil) and Valparaiso (Chile). Quito is our 104th deployment globally, with over a dozen additional cities in the works right now.

Cloudflare participates at over 150 Internet exchanges globally with an open peering policy, and welcomes the opportunity to interconnect locally. As additional networks peer with Cloudflare, we’ll be able to localize a growing share of traffic that would have otherwise been served from Miami, while helping support the Internet exchange as a whole. In South America, we are existing members of the Terremark NAP do Brasil, Camara Argentina de Internet (CABASE) Buenos Aires and PTT São Paulo (run by NIC.BR).

With over 350 million Internet users, Latin America is experiencing the second fastest growth globally in mobile penetration. We are now only days away from announcing two additional South American data centers to improve the performance and security of 6 million Internet properties.

Sooner yet is Cloudflare's 105th deployment! After Monday in Asia, and Tuesday in South America, tomorrow, we travel to a new continent. All roads lead to the home of our next data center.|||
