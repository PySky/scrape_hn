Service industry is built on value delivered to end-user, not on ideals, heads or the level of intellect at a organisation. During the recent quagmire surrounding Yahoo! sale, Marisa Mayer has been presented as the devil’s advocate in representing the tiny 1% minority.

People seem to forget her contributions towards trying to innovate Yahoo! out of no where from logo redesign to acquiring startups to fuel forward Yahoo!. Setting all that aside and analysing failure as planned and expected represents a degenerate mindset. Silicon valley is where failure and engineers will to venture, catches applaud. Here we find the media butchering Marisa for probably just the cause that she is a women and made some good money.

I am of the opinion that women need to be recognised as equals at job and in pay, otherwise you get what we call a Trump. Let’s not loose the few good women left.

I leave you with a quote from Marisa, to decide your own intellectual compass.

I think Google should be like a Swiss Army knife: clean, simple, the tool you want to take everywhere.|||
