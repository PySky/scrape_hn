If you’ve worked with content management systems in the past, you’ve likely worked with a traditional CMS like WordPress, Drupal, or RefineryCMS.

API-based CMS’s, also called “headless” or “decoupled” CMS’s, provide a UI and storage for editing content, along with an API for integrating that dynamic content into your website.

So why would you want to use an API-based CMS instead of a traditional CMS?

In a gist, API-based CMS’s offer all the same editing capabilities of traditional CMS’s, but are significantly easier for developer to setup and maintain. This means your developers spend less time and money working on your CMS, and more time focusing on things important to your business.

Ask most developers and they’ll tell you that working on content management ranks low on their list of interesting work. API-based CMS’s eliminate many of the pains of CMS’s so development teams can get the job done and move onto more important projects.|||
