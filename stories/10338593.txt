We recently re-discovered Walter Chen’s blog post about monthly expenses at iDoneThis (a wonderfully simple daily productivity tool). In the spirit of sharing our progress at Underdog.io, we’ve decided to publish a breakdown of our own monthly SaaS and technology expenses.

For now, we’ve opted to exclude salaries, Stripe fees, advertising, office supplies, and rent. We may disclose them in a future post.

Some things that we found interesting:

We’re on annual plans for a few of these products. To keep things simple, we converted their prices to a monthly equivalent. We’re pulling company logos via Clearbit’s free Logo API.|||
