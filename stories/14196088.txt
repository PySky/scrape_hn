We are accepting reservations for both of our systems. If you’re not sure about reserving or are outside the US, please contact our sales team. If you have questions about the reservation process, take a look at the FAQs.

We are taking reservations for both the Studio and Production Systems. Production System reservations require a Studio System. Shipping priority is based on the order in which reservations are received. Users drive our product development efforts through feedback and applications. Let us know your needs and key materials and we’ll prioritize them. Reserve a Studio System for $1,000 and a Production System for $5,000. Reservations can be made by credit card online or a member of our sales team can get in touch.|||
