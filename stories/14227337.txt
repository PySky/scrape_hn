Nautilus has burned through, according to your figures, some $10 million in foundation grants in five years.

But that’s just the foundation funding. Nautilus is also, in effect, being subsidized by writers and illustrators who work for it without pay. We can only guess, but it seems likely that the pay that never went to contributors amounts to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in subsidies for Nautilus.

It’s time we recognized that many online publications–Undark not among them–are being subsidized by writers. And we should stop subsidizing them.|||

Funding shortfalls at the luxe science magazine have left some contributors waiting months to be paid. They may need to wait a little longer.
