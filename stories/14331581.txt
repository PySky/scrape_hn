I am not a hard-core fan of the New Year's Eve celebrations. Anyhow, I decided to start the year sharing with you the best Automate The Planet's content from 2016. 

 Also, I wanted to thank you for continuing reading my articles. Supporting the idea of writing high-quality automation, being "lazy", creative and full of energy. This way I believe we help the world to become much better place- faster. 



The number of the subscribers grew from 200 to 2400+



I didn't skip even a week past year to publish a new article, so a new milestone was covered- 200 articles!



The new Facebook page is a huge deal. 16k+ fans! Thank you!



Almost 5000 followers on Twitter. Unbelievable! (4000 for 2016)



We deployed the new version of the site on 30.12.2016 just for the start of 2017. Please, share your thoughts about it in the comments. There is a new logo too! The new site is 70+% faster.



It was a really long journey. After lots of work, conversations, over 100 bugs, 7 programmers, the new version of the site is here!!! I hope you like it!



The new Resouces Section where you can download lots of free materials.



I was a speaker at SEETEST 2016﻿ conference in Bucharest Romania and Heisenbug 2016 in Moscow Russia. It was an honour for me to talk there. You can find the recordings and the slide decks in my Special Edition Series.



My paper got published in Quality Matters Magazine.



There were several interviews with me last year. You can find one of them on the site of my friend Thanh Huynh (AskTester).

8. Getting Started with Telerik Testing Framework C# in 10 Minutes (1206)

5. Getting Started with WebDriver C# in 10 Minutes (6258)

As you may know, I am a Code Project MVP for 2016, so I publish almost all of my articles there too. At the beginning of this year, another milestone will be reached- 1 million reads of my articles there.



1. Get Property Names Using Lambda Expressions in C# (11820)

I am a man that always love to have plans and stick to them. I will continue to produce high-quality articles each week. I also plan to develop video and email courses. I hope you will read soon about them.

Thank you for being loyal fans and readers! Happy coding/testing!
