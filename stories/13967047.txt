I’ve really come to like JavaScript. No, it’s not Ruby, but then again, nothing is. ES2015 was a huge step forward. Particularly the class notation and the metaprogramming improvements. And now it seems like there’s finally good momentum to keep improving.

I’m less enthusiastic about the JavaScript ecosystem, but as a language, yes please. It shares many of the values of Ruby. Open prototypes, metaprogramming at the forefront, etc.|||
