Technology isn't all about looks. Audio is equally, if not more, important.

That's why Microsoft built a world-class audio lab at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

"One of the big things right now is personal assistants, like Cortana for example," LeSalle Munroe, senior engineer of Surface devices, said in a video for Microsoft. "For that to work well, audio is very important: audio on the microphone side, and audio on the speaker side. We want to have the best tools available for the job."

Recently, Microsoft invited a representative from Guinness World Records to test the acoustic qualities of its audio lab. The results were nothing short of stellar.
