libGDX is a cross platform Java game development framework that provides a single API that works on all supported platforms.

Instead of creating build to iOS/Android/Javascript after each code change, you can run and debug your game on the desktop, natively which reduces your iteration times considerably.

We’ve written a complete tutorial to illustrate how developers can write multiplayer games by integrating AppWarp cloud Java SDK with libGDX. The tutorial uses the excellent single player superjumper sample from libgdx-sample and extends it to a 2 player realtime game.

The complete tutorial is available here with source code and step by step integration guide. AppWarp concepts illustrated are dynamic game rooms, lock properties and our TCP/UDP sendUpdate APIs. Send us a mail on support@shephertz.com with your questions and comments.|||
