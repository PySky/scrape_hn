MWHAHAHAHA. Seriously. This script is a copy of Facebook Stories of a copy of Facebook Messenger Day of a copy of WhatsApp status of a copy of Instagram stories of a copy of Snapchat stories.

You can read stories from any endpoint (JSON, Firebase, etc.) and the script will do the rest.

stories ({ id , skin , avatars , shows user photo instead of last story item preview list , openEffect , cubeEffect , enables the 3d cube effect when sliding story - may decrease performance autoFullScreen , backButton , backNative , uses window history to enable back button on browsers/android stories [ ], callbacks { ( , ) { (); }, ( ) { }, ( , ) { (); }, ( , ) { (); }, ( , , ) { (); }, }, { if you need to translate :) , Press space to see next , , { , , , , , , , , , } } });

A JSON example of the stories object:

{ id , photo , name , story name (or user name) link , lastUpdated , seen , set true if user has opened - if local storage is used, you don't need to care about this items [ { id , type , length , photo timeout or video length in seconds - uses 3 seconds timeout for images if not set src , preview , optional - item thumbnail to show in the story carousel instead of the story defined image link , linkText , time , optional a date to display with the story item. unix timestamp are converted to "time ago" format seen set true if current user was read - if local storage is used, you don't need to care about this } ] }

Then in your JS:

Use with autoFullScreen option (disabled by default) to emulate an app on mobile devices.

On mobile browsers, video can't play with audio without a user gesture. So the script tries to play audio only when the user clicks to see the next story. When the story is playing automatically, the video is muted, but an alert is displayed so the user may click to turn the audio on.

Stories links opens in a new window too. This behaviour occurs because most websites are blocked on iframe embedding.

Sorry I got inspired - It makes me so happy to see people laughing at this, thank you! :)|||
