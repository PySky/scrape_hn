It's my understanding that "Drop In" is only enabled for the Echo Show, Amazon's new Echo device with a screen.

Alexa will let you know when someone is calling, and a green light ring will appear on your supported Echo device. You can ask Alexa to answer or ignore the call. With Echo Show, you’ll also be able to make video calls or use Drop In, a new feature for the special cases when you want to connect instantly with your closest family and friends.

It sounds like, at the minute, Drop In will only work on the Echo Show. At the minute, with an Echo or Echo Dot, you're limited to calling other Alexa devices with the calling feature enabled, according to TechCrunch:

Amazon says that Alexa Calling can be used on any Echo device and the Alexa app once the user and the user’s intended contact have both enabled Alexa calling and messaging. In other words, for now (emphasis on for now; Amazon is nothing less than massively ambitious), it sounds like you can’t use your Echo Dot to call your friend’s landline.

You can always send feedback to suggest that Drop In is enabled for other devices—I've heard that Amazon are pretty good at listening to feedback and implementing it (e.g. the Computer wake word, which many people requested).|||
