Samsung might be better known for its excellent smartphones and television sets, but its latest initiative takes aim at the movie industry. The company has unveiled its brand-new ‘Cinema Screen’ specifically designed for cinema theaters.

As the first-ever theater-sized High Dynamic Range LED display, Cinema Screen promises “unprecedented picture quality” with “higher vibrancy and accuracy” than anything your eyes have previously seen.

The South Korean heavyweight is debuting the new movie display in a series of demonstrations between March 27 and March 30 in theaters at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

Specifically designed for the modern blockbuster experience, the new display tech easily accommodates modern theater dimensions, delivering magnificent picture quality at 4K resolution (4,096 x 2,160 pixels).

In addition to this, the screen also exceeds the highly-esteemed DCI standards for reliability, technical performance and quality in digital cinema.

Thanks to the direct-lit LED tech powering the display, Cinema Screen has the capacity to offer peak brightness levels nearly 10 times higher than standard cinema projectors.

As the popularity of advanced at-home entertainment systems and streaming platforms increases, theaters must reposition themselves as a destination for an incomparable viewing experience that consumers simply cannot encounter anywhere else,” said Vice President Sang Kim.

“Our new Cinema Screen technology brings a more powerful and high-quality picture to the big screen, creating an environment where viewers feel as if they are part of every scene.”

Samsung’s innovative HDR display has already completed compliance tests at Keio University in Tokyo, but is yet awaiting DCI certification.

Chances are you’ll be seeing it in theaters across the globe in the recent future.|||
