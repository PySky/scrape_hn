The Root Zone Database represents the delegation details of top-level domains, including gTLDs such as .com, and country-code TLDs such as .uk. As the manager of the DNS root zone, we are responsible for coordinating these delegations in accordance with our policies and procedures.

Much of this data is also available via the WHOIS protocol at whois.iana.org.|||
