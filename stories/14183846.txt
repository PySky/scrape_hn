A 17-year-old girl died in a Lisbon hospital early on Wednesday of a measles infection, a Portuguese General Directorate of Health (DGS) source told EFE.

She was the first death registered since the DGS declared a measles "epidemic" some days ago.

This highly-contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions.

The deceased adolescent lived in Cascais, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of Lisbon, and was admitted last weekend to the intensive care unit of Dona Estefania Hospital with a serious diagnosis due to a measles-related respiratory complication.

Portugal's health minister, Adalberto Campos Fernándes, held a press conference in which he asked the population to remain calm and to trust the nation's health authorities.

After expressing his condolences to the youth's family, the minister disclosed the victim was "not protected" as she had not been administered the measles vaccine.

"We will do everything to protect the population and ensure in the coming weeks that the situation is under control," the minister said.

According to Campos Fernándes, the government was in the initial stages of a "stabilization process" regarding the measles epidemic; he added that "the best response is prevention."

The Portuguese Health General Director, Francisco George, called for educators and parents to "work together" to avoid the propagation of the measles virus.

He added that there were currently 21 confirmed cases of measles in Portugal, mostly children who had not been vaccinated against the viral disease.|||
