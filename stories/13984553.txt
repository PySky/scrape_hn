We are pleased to announce the release of Logstash 5.3.0. If you can't wait to get your hands on it, head straight to our downloads page. You can also view the release notes here.



We've made a few important enhancements and resiliency improvements to the persistent queue feature. Among them:

While the persistent queue feature is still in beta for 5.3.0, we've incorporated feedback from our users and fixed important bugs reported during this phase. We have a couple of features yet to complete before we can remove the beta tag off of this feature. Please stay tuned for our updates, and your feedback is very welcome!

After releasing monitoring UI for Logstash in 5.2 as part of the X-Pack basic license, we've got lots of feedback from users. In this release, we've fixed a few defects and added more graphs!

Cgroup information: Version 5.2 added the ability to collect and report on cgroup information in the monitoring API. These stats are useful when you are running Logstash in a container. Version 5.3 brings new charts that show cgroup information in comparison to the regular machine level CPU. There are also new graphs under the “Advanced” tab to show how many times the container is being throttled, duration, etc.

Persistent queue stats: Under the “Advanced” tab, a new graph shows the number of events queued on disk over time. This provides a better understanding of the event lag during ingestion.

To add to the awesomeness, this release is also packed with tons of plugin goodies. Here’s some highlights:

Besides the JDBC filter, four other new plugins have joined the family with great contributions from our community!



We are super excited for this release of Logstash and look forward to your feedback. You can reach us at our forum, open issues in your GitHub repo or twitter(@elastic). Happy 'stashing!|||
