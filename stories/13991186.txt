In the last week, three different people have asked me what we are doing at Whitman to ensure women are included in the CS program. I guess that means it’s time to write a blog post.

I’ll address what we’re doing now, the effects we’re seeing, and what I think we will be doing in the future.

What we’re doing now:

Right now, we have a fair number of women in CS 167. For example, my section has 8 women out of 21 students total, about 40%. It has been heartwarming to hear from several women that CS167 is their favorite class and they are now considering a CS major. Unfortunately, CS/MATH 220 and CS 270 each have only a handful of women. There are still fewer women in upper-level courses. I am hopeful we will see more women at the 200-level and beyond as changes to CS 167 and student culture take effect.

What we plan to do in the future:|||
