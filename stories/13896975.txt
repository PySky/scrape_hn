It is a TLS modelled protocol primarily designed to facilitate attribute information transmission in a manner that doesn't compromise the security or privacy of users. The protocol provides end-to-end encryption and triple-blind interfacing between trust providers,trust consumers and the Cipheredtrust API.

We've implemented this protocol as a simple REST API for developers to consumer and easily integrate information verification into any application/app/website.

The full documentation of the protocol and API can be found on our site: https://www.cipheredtrust.com/doc/
