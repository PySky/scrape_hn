This is the ECMAScript framework for working with FIX protocol messages. Compliant with FIX 5.0 SP2.

The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol is an electronic communications protocol initiated in 1992 for international real-time exchange of information related to the securities transactions and markets.

Create an instance of the class:

The general format of a FIX message is a standard header followed by the message body fields and terminated with a standard trailer.

Each message is constructed of a stream of = fields with a field delimiter between fields in the stream. Tags are of data type TagNum. All tags must have a value specified. Optional fields without values should simply not be specified in the FIX message. A Reject message is the appropriate response to a tag with no value. Except where noted, fields within a message can be defined in any sequence (Relative position of a field within a message is inconsequential.) The exceptions to this rule are:

In addition, certain fields of the data type MultipleCharValue can contain multiple individual values separated by a space within the "value" portion of that field followed by a single "SOH" character (e.g. "18=2 9 C" represents 3 individual values: '2', '9', and 'C'). Fields of the data type MultipleStringValue can contain multiple values that consists of string values separated by a space within the "value" portion of that field followed by a single "SOH" character (e.g. "277=AA I AJ" represents 3 values: 'AA', 'I', 'AJ').

It is also possible for a field to be contained in both the clear text portion and the encrypted data sections of the same message. This is normally used for validation and verification. For example, sending the SenderCompID in the encrypted data section can be used as a rudimentary validation technique. In the cases where the clear text data differs from the encrypted data, the encrypted data should be considered more reliable. (A security warning should be generated).
