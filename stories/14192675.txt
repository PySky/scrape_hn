The basics of positioning are pretty well explained in the official React Native documentation.

However, it only covers simple cases such as centering items or putting one element on top, middle and bottom.

 Here I intend to cover some cases that are quite common but for which I couldn’t find a suitable documentation.

N.B.: All of the following also works the other way around, or with top and bottom instead of left and right if you use on the container.

If you don’t know the width of the element on the right, you can still wrap every item in another .

 Left and right wrappers will take all the available space, leaving the middle one centered.

 The left wrapper will be empty.

React native still misses which is useful for grouping items – you can follow the state of the issue here.

Meanwhile what we can do is adding elements with a property to make them fill the space between blocks.

You can also add the property directly to your elements:
