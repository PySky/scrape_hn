The featured topic for this month’s Austin PPC Event is Sequential Marketing & Messaging. By applying a drip content strategy to your business’ remarketing approach, you can significantly impact the engagement levels of your previous visitors. The fusion of this PPC & Nurture Marketing concept allows marketers to monitor the progression of leads through a “flow” of messages, and keep the dialogue going by constantly adapting to how the prospect responds (or doesn’t respond) to a particular piece of communication. Come hear industry veterans discuss the sequential marketing strategies and tactics they’ve used to get impressive results for their clients.

The discussion will be led by a panel from 360Partners, Austin’s smart search marketing agency specializing in PPC, SEO, CRO and DBI. We’re a Google Premier Partner, a Bing Select Partner and one of Austin’s Top Workplaces for 3 years.

Hey y'all, we are organizing our next Online Geniuses Marketing Meetup.

This is a great place to come if you have questions on marketing, expertise to share, or if you're hiring or looking for a gig.



This is a brand new group that we're excited to expand and evolve into a regular Meetup. 



Thanks to Galvanize for hosting us!|||
