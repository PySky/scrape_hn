Plain old randomness just doesn't cut it sometimes. Personalize your SSH keys.

These keys are probably not safe for real-use, but I don't know enough cryptography to quantify the impact of reducing entropy this way on the chance of finding either prime.

The idea is not my own. I remember reading someone who did the same thing for their SSL certificates, but I can't find their page anymore. If you do, please let me know so I can link to them here.|||
