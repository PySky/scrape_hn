There is a certain benefit to being first to market. First to innovate.

Namely, you look really cool.

Perhaps more importantly (at least from a business perspective), you are the one credited as a true innovator — if you’ve played your cards right.

Elon Musk is perhaps the best (and most public) example of being first to the table in years. PayPal. Tesla. SolarCity. SpaceX. E-commerce. Electric cars. Solar power. Space travel! All ventures made in fields virtually clear of competitors. Business is made and money (or mindshare) is earned by taking the lion’s share of both news stories and users.

However, Elon Musk just made the classic mistake of those first to the table: He presumed the table would never shift. Of course, all good and popular tables do. As more and more eager minds take a seat, the eyes on Elon — and the conversations about him — will turn to others. The most important question regarding those who sat down first is if they can anticipate these shifts, and weather them.

Looking at SpaceX, the answer doesn’t look promising. Competitors are talking trash about SpaceX as he is talking trash about Apple — but the difference is that for SpaceX, two products or visions for space travel can actually go head-to-head. When the other company is shrouded in secrecy, you don’t get such a luxury.

There is a certain downside to being first to market. First to innovate. You look absolutely ancient when someone else comes in and blows you out of the water. Unfortunately for Elon, there is a certain company that has a history of proving they can do just that.|||
