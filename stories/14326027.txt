“We’re making a game about homelessness” is not what I expected to hear when I started working at an ad agency. “We need you to get more kids to smoke our brand” or “I know the product sucks, make them want it!” maybe, but not a game about homelessness. The game we made at McKinney is now part of the curriculum at hundreds of schools in the US, has been played 6 million+ times and won a Webby. You should play it . It’ll make you feel terrible. There’s very little chance I’ll ever love a project more than this one. But I’m open to being wrong.|||
