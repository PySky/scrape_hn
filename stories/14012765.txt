We have been hard at work these past few years. Not only on DEVONthink To Go 2 and our new sync technology but also a new generation of our AI engine. Meet Awareness.

Before our applications used only the documents, their metadata, and information derived from the way you filed them. Awareness goes much further. It tracks which applications you are using, what actions you perform, and where. Then it creates groups and files items as you work and when you return to, e.g., DEVONthink you’ll find hierarchies, tags, and connections already made for you and ready to use.

But not every day is similar. There are productive days when your razor-sharp mind is focused to the max, but also slow days, days where you’re easily distracted. Awareness collects data from the mouse movements, the trackpad, the way you make gestures on your iOS device, the temperature sensors, the accelerometer, and the front-facing camera.

From all this, and some fairly complex math, it detects if you’re in a flow or distracted, calm or nervous, happy or tensed up — and adjusts the way the app interacts with you. DEVONthink will never again disturb you when you’re totally emerged into writing but will proactively offer help when it thinks that you’re lost. DEVONagent will hide disturbing news when you might not be in an appropriate mood for them.|||
