Mock your future API or extend the existing API with realistic data from faker.js. No coding required. All you need is to write GraphQL IDL. Don't worry, we will provide you with examples in our IDL editor.

In the GIF bellow we add fields to types inside real GitHub API and you can make queries from GraphiQL, Apollo, Relay, etc. and receive real data mixed with mock data.

We use directive to let you specify how to fake data. And if 60+ fakers is not enough for you, just use directive to provide examples. Just add a directive to any field or custom scalar definition:

No need to remember or read any docs. Autocompletion is included!

Mock GraphQL API based on example IDL and open interactive editor:

Note: You can specify non-existing IDL file names - Faker will use example IDL which you can edit in interactive editor.

Extend real data from SWAPI with faked data based on extension IDL:

Extend real data from GitHub API with faked data based on extension IDL (you can get token here):

- path to file with IDL. If this argument is omited Faker uses default file name.|||
