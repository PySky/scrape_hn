On the 20th February 2016, then Prime Minister David Cameron announced that there would be a referendum in June on the UKâ€™s continued membership of the European Union (EU). The electorate were asked "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union", with 52% of the voting electorate answering "Leave" and 48% "Remain".

In the weeks leading up to the referendum, a number of organisations, political parties and individuals produced campaigning leaflets which sought to persuade the electorate to vote either "Leave" or "Remain". These leaflets were collected jointly by the British Library and LSE Library. They form part of a wider set of archives available at LSE Library that document the long and complex relationship between Britain and the European Union.|||
