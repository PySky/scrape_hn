An extension for Chromium-based browsers that disables HTML5 audio and video autoplaying

UPDATE: There is now an effort to disable autoplay from the browser itself. Please see the Chromium issue report and the referenced design document for more details.

NOTICE: I have stopped maintaining this project. However, I still welcome contributions (as pull requests) to the project. I recommend rewriting the extension as version 0.7 because the code in 0.6 is hard to maintain. If you still want to make changes to the 0.6 series, you can do so in the branch.

In addition to removing the HTML attribute from media elements, Disable HTML5 Autoplay also hooks into the media's JavaScript API. This allows for restrictions on media control and simulation of expected behavior to ensure that all pages behave normally.

Please consult the Wiki for information on using the extension, solutions to common issues, getting help, and more.

Currently, only Chrome/Chromium and Opera are supported. Firefox will be supported in the future; see Issue #40 for more details.
