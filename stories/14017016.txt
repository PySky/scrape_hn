Last week, I read an amazing article in the Economist about China and soft power.

It described the origins of China’s obsession with developing “soft power.” It’s a decade-long obsession on behalf of the Communist Party that it’s spend some $10 billion per year on according to the story.

As the Economist details, it came from an American academic named Joseph Nye. He essentially argued the power of “attraction” not just compulsion. Not only fear, but love. Honey, not vinegar.

It wrote about how— in part— it’s made strides. Young people, for instance, have a more favorable view of China. Africans love it— in large part— because Chinese capital is rebuilding the continent’s infrastructure.

But largely China’s efforts to build Soft Power have stalled because, well, facts. Reassuring in 2017 Trump America isn’t it?|||
