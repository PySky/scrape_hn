IBM was the first company to launch an LTO-6 drive available November 9, 2012.

Three years later, it's also the first one to reveal an LTO-7 device supposed to reach the market on November 20, 2015, as Big Blue continues one of the strongest promoter of tape technology in the industry since decades.

The specs comply with the announcement of the LTO Program last September.

In conjunction, IBM released several products incorporating new LTO-7 tape drive:

IBM didn't reveal the source of the LTO-7 media but we presume they come from Fujifilm.

Now we are waiting for HP to launch its own drive and media makers (Fujifilm, Maxell, Sony?) their cartridges.|||
