Keeto is a module for OpenSSH that enables profile-based administration of access permissions in a central LDAP aware Directory Service, adds support for X.509 certificates and handles the distribution of OpenSSH key material in an automated and secure manner.

The fundamental idea behind is to leverage existing infrastructure usually found in larger enterprises for managing access to OpenSSH servers comprising the assignment and revocation of access permissions and the management of keys. In order to gain full advantage of Keeto a PKI and associated processes have to be present. Optionally a strong protection mechanism for private keys such as a Smartcard can be used to increase the level of security.

Proper key management is vital to maintain the security of services. This comprises the secure generation of key material with approved tools and security parameters, the secure distribution and installation of keys and an appropriate key lifecycle management including the revocation, regeneration and removal of keys.

OpenSSH uses its own key format that solely consists of the data needed for the cryptographic operation during authentication. In comparison to X.509 certificates there is no binding to an identity, no integrity protection, no expiration and no mechanism for revocation.|||
