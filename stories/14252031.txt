is a command-line utility from VMware that lets one do useful things with VMs on ESXi and vSphere remote systems.

I had installed and was trying to use it copy a VM between two ESXi servers, based on this useful post from virtuallyGhetto. For various reasons, it’s often a better idea to use for copying VMs than by just using on the raw files.

This confused the living daylights out of me. This has nothing at all to do with looking up a host.

Locators. At least, the URI-flavored ones. A locator points to different resource types like VMs or hosts.

When gets a URI, it’s more or less of the form or

If gets a URI without the password - which I would imagine most security conscious people would prefer - it quite sensibly prompts for a password and captures it without displaying it.

At this point, it appears that forms the full URI - including password - and uses that to authenticate with the remote system.

You can see where this is going.

The PDF manual clearly notes (but not clearly enough, in my view):

Now I get it.

This hypothesis can be proven as follows.

A simple workaround is to urlencode the password yourself on the command line. If you have access to a clipboard-copy-paste utility, the entire thing can be done without displaying the password.

Let’s say that your password is .

This code snippet will prompt for the unencoded password, urlencode it, and put it into the clipboard, ready for pasting. The advantage of using this over the various command-line urlencoding utilities - that might or might not be available - is that Python is available just about everywhere these days. If not, there’s always Perl.|||
