Recent advances in machine learning have sparked a renewed interest for dialogue systems in the research community. In addition to the growing real-world applications, the ability to converse is closely related to the overall goal of AI. This NIPS Live Competition aims to unify the community around the challenging task: building systems capable of intelligent conversations. Teams are expected to submit dialogue systems able to carry out intelligent and natural conversations about specific news articles with humans. At the final stage of the competition participants, as well as volunteers, will be randomly matched with a bot or a human to chat and evaluate answers of a peer. We expect the competition to have two major outcomes: (1) a measure of quality of state-of-the-art dialogue systems, and (2) an open-source dataset collected from evaluated dialogues.

The competition consists of four rounds.

Both human evaluators and dialogue agents complete the same task.

Dataset collected during competition will be distributed under MIT license.

Participants have to make their systems available open source following the end of the competition, as the goal of the challenge is to enable the community to make sustained progress towards the creation of conversational intelligence. The data used by teams to pretrain models should be made open access or available on request for academic purposes.
