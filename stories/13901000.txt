Here's what needs to happen immediately after a user starts typing:

In the video you can see that Telegram returns around 20 inline results every time you pause while typing. That's great for seeing lots of options, but it's also a lot of encoding to do simultaneously. And if the bot isn't fast enough than it definitely won't be worth using.

To make serverside compositing and encoding fast enough usually requires a bunch of hardware or expensive video encoding services. However, there is one thing working in our favor - each gif in the result is completely independent, so it's very parallelizable. We just need a server with enough cores to take advantage of that fact.|||

Our dumb GIF chat bot would have cost us 10x more on AWS.
