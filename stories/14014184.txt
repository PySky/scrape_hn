I just ran a thorough feedback cycle for the managers (leads) in my team. This is what it looked like.

Motivation: It’s hard to get feedback as a manager, the hope was that people would be more candid if they 1) submitted feedback anonymously 2) to someone else. Because we tend to amplify negative feedback, there was a benefit to having someone else go through it, find trends, and repackage it for the recipient.

On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate XXX’s overall performance as a lead? (one being “they suck” and 10 being “they don’t come any better”? Explain your rating.  What’s the best part of working with XXX? What’s the hardest part of working with XXX? What are three of  XXX’s strengths? What do you wish XXX would do more of? What do you wish XXX would do less of? If you had one suggestion for how XXX could go from good to great, or from awesome to awesomer, what would it be? If you were having lunch with a friend and talking about your job, how would you describe XXX as a lead? Complete the following, “My ideal lead is someone who…” Describe yourself when you are at your best.  Is there anything XXX does to enable that?

My coach Dani put these together for me 💜

Note: this is just the time commitment for me to run it. Writing the 3-2-1-Oh!s and filling in feedback for others also took up time on the team.

I loved this feedback review mostly because of how structured and transparent it was. Not only did I know everyone who was getting reviewed, but I knew everyone was getting the same questions. That relieved a lot of the stress in wondering “why did I get this review request?”. The question format of listing things (name one thing, what are the three things, etc) also made it super quick.

There weren’t any big surprises in my feedback, but I appreciated getting the reinforcement that I’m on the right track — knowing what you’re doing well is always motivating. I liked that the top-level points were broken down into “what your team appreciates” and “what your team would like to see” — where criticism is presented as concrete things that can be improved or changed.

I’ve always been apprehensive about getting feedback about myself just because of a fear of failure. Internally I can feel like I am succeeding but still get nervous when I go through a feedback process. This process eliminated a ton of that upfront fear because I knew what questions were being asked and trusted the process to be fair and unbiased unlike in previous jobs. I love getting actionable things to do or try out!
