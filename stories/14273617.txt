Why does it say “Transaction does not exist”?

In the following cases, you may be told that your transaction does not exist:

1) Too low fee: We only provide accelerator services for those with at least 0.0001BTC/KB transaction fees;

2) Node reboot: When a Bitcoin node is rebooted, synchronization of transaction data may be delayed. You can try again later;

3) Previous transaction unconfirmed. Your transaction can’t be confirmed if previous transactions connecting to yours are unconfirmed. You’ll need to wait till all previous transactions are confirmed first. You can also use our accelerator to help with that.

We can’t accelerate confirmation of “Double spent” transactions either.|||
