Series & DataFrame have been enhanced to support the aggregation API. This is a familiar API from groupby, window operations, and resampling. This allows aggregation operations in a concise way by using and . The full documentation is here (GH1623).

One can operate using string function names, callables, lists, or dictionaries of these.

Using a single function is equivalent to .

Using a dict provides the ability to apply specific aggregations per column. You will get a matrix-like output of all of the aggregators. The output has one column per unique function. Those functions applied to a particular column will be :

The API also supports a function for broadcasting results.

When presented with mixed dtypes that cannot be aggregated, will only take the valid aggregations. This is similiar to how groupby works. (GH15015)|||
