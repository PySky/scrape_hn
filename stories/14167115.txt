Build nice client-side curated list by editing yaml file. See demo for movies - https://imdb.netlify.com/.

After running all html, css and js files are generated in folder. You can use files for github pages or netlify deployment or maybe even AWS S3.

Any help from talented people with design or programming skills is very welcome.|||
