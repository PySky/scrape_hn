Pay your attention to our new library that makes it possible to read, edit and write CSV files. If you use Android-based device, you can easily use our library for implementation of all aforementioned actions. In addition, you will be able to change rows and columns, display the picture via link, and align the required data. It will surely help you cope with your tasks faster and make your output higher. AdaptiveTableLayout library is at your disposal.

The main goal of the library is to apply all its functions in the process of working with CSV files. Moreover, it will give you a competitive edge over others.

You could use adapter interfaces: AdaptiveTableAdapter and DataAdaptiveTableLayoutAdapter. But to simplify the usage, library contains base adapters: BaseDataAdaptiveTableLayoutAdapter and LinkedAdaptiveTableAdapter.

BaseDataAdaptiveTableLayoutAdapter - simple adapter which works with light data. WARNING! on each row/column switch, original data will be changed.

LinkedAdaptiveTableAdapter - adapter which works with heavy data. WARNING! This type of adapter doesn't change original data. It contains matrix with changed items with links on it. To get changed data you need use AdaptiveTableLayout.getLinkedAdapterRowsModifications() and AdaptiveTableLayout.getLinkedAdapterColumnsModifications(). Don't forget to check AdaptiveTableLayout.isSolidRowHeader() flag. If it's false, you need to ignore switching first elemet in each row.

For both adapters you need to know all rows/columns widths, heights and rows/columns count before set adapter to AdaptiveTableLayout.
