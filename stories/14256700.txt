Today, we began notifying customers of our decision to retire Meldium from LogMeIn’s current line of products. In an effort to unify our password management offerings, we took the best of Meldium and built it in to LastPass to deliver a simple, secure tool with an intuitive user experience.

When we acquired Meldium in 2014 and then LastPass, the market leading password manager, in 2015, we had planned to combine both password management investments under the LastPass brand and product line. Since then, we introduced LastPass Teams, which is the safe, simple way for teams & small businesses to manage passwords, and it has the same look and feel as Meldium.

Our users’ needs are our top priority with this change. In an effort to provide a seamless transition, we are providing specific instructions to help existing Meldium users migrate to LastPass or another cloud offering. All Meldium users will be given until July 5th to migrate away from Meldium, and can choose to move to LastPass or go to another service.

A step-by-step guide on how to move your data out of Meldium and into LastPass can be found here: https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/migrating-accounts-from-meldium-to-lastpass/
