Today at Microsoft’s Windows 10 hardware event, ahead of new device news EVP of Windows and Devices Group Terry Myerson gave an update on how the new platform is doing so far: there are now 110 million devices now running Windows 10.

And in a boost to its ambition to get more universal apps on its platform that work across different Microsoft platforms, he said that new apps for Windows 10 will include universal apps for Facebook, its Messenger service and Facebook-owned photo and video app Instagram. (A big leap for a platform that was very late to the Instagram party, you may recall.)

Other apps that will get the universal treatment include story-telling visual app Flipagram, Box, Candy Crush Soda Saga and Uber, he said.

Myerson also said that there have now been 1 billion visits to the Windows Store — without giving out any stats on downloads. He said that developer payouts have grown four-fold since the Windows 10 upgrade went out earlier this year — again, declining to give a hard number.

The 110 million figure is a slight update on the 100 million devices noted at the end of September.

At the end of September, Microsoft noted there were about 670,000 apps on the Windows Store, which combines apps for phones along with Windows NT apps and universal apps, or those that work on multiple platforms. As a point of comparison, Apple has about 1.5 billion apps and Google has 1.6 billion on Google Play.

We’ll update this post with more apps news as it comes out of the event.|||
