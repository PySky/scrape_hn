This book you are reading is interactive -- each chapter can run as a Jupyter Notebook.

We packed this book, Jupyter, PaddlePaddle, and all dependencies into a Docker image. So you don't need to install anything except Docker. If you are using Windows, please follow this installation guide. If you are running Mac, please follow this. For various Linux distros, please refer to https://www.docker.com. If you are using Windows or Mac, you might want to give Docker more memory and CPUs/cores.

This command will download the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub.com and run it in a container. Please direct your Web browser to http://localhost:8888 to read the book.

If you are living in somewhere slow to access DockerHub.com, you might try our mirror server docker.paddlepaddle.org:

By default we are using CPU for training, if you want to train with GPU, the steps are a little different.

To make sure GPU can be successfully used from inside container, please install nvidia-docker. Then run:

Or you can use the image registry mirror in China:
