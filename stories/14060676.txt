These days, it can really feel like the Old Bag of Sales Tricks is starting to just not work anymore:

Are there categories where outbound just doesn’t work?

Well maybe, but let’s step back a minute.

One thing has not changed in SaaS in the last 10 years:

The 10,000th uncustomized “did we meet at SaaStr Annual?” email is not going to work, at least not 99 times out of 100.

But if you know your prospects and her problems, and target her exactly, and hit her when she’s looking for a solution — outbound sort of always works.  At least some of the time.

At least, it almost always creates a dialogue some of the time.

Given that, realize if your outbound team isn’t performing at all, maybe it’s their approach.  Yes, the playbooks of 2009 and even 2013 may not work as well in 2017 and 2018.

But VPs are still sitting in their corner office, struggling to hit their plans, manage their teams, hire the next great engineer, deploy their software releases, and hit their OKRs.

If you have one of 10,000 tools in the market that all sort of do the same simple thing — well, then yes, inbound may be your only solution.

But if you have a solution to a true real and important headache …

Well, then iterate and find a way to get to the VPs, Directors and CEOs whose very top headaches and problem you can truly solve.|||
