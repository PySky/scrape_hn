Itâ€™s been a while since I posted a new article. This is because I have ventured into the exciting field of Machine Learning and have been doing some competitions on Kaggle.

In this quick post I just wanted to share some Python code which can be used to benchmark, test, and develop Machine Learning algorithms with any size of data.

In other words: this dataset generation can be used to do emperical measurements of Machine Learning algorithms.

The code has been commented and I will include a Theano version and a numpy-only version of the code.

Have fun with these snippets!|||
