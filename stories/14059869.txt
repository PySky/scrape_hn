Welcome to the OpenCitations homepage!

The main output of the OpenCitations Project is the creation of the Open Citations Corpus (OCC), an open repository of scholarly citation data made available under a Creative Commons public domain dedication, which provides in RDF accurate citation information (bibliographic references) harvested from the scholarly literature. These are described using the SPAR Ontologies according to the OCC metadata model, and are made freely available so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse them for any purpose, without restriction under copyright or database law.

The OCC is being continuously populated from the scholarly literature.

As of May 14, 2017, the OCC has ingested the references from

150773 citing bibliographic resources

and contains information about 6464770 citation links

to 4007357 cited resources.

The whole OCC is now available for querying (via SPARQL) and for browsing by means of a very simple Web interface that shows only the data about bibliographic entities (e.g. https://w3id.org/oc/corpus/br/1). Additional and more user-friendly interfaces will be available in the coming months, and will be described in this page.
