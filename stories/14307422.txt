Report and view Pokemon sightings from around the world - coming soon!

Do you take feedback and suggestions?

What are the buttons when I click into a location?

Those are for favoriting, marking a visit or viewing comments. You can also vote on it either not existing or being a gym.

How does the voting work?

Signed in users can mark / vote on unverified locations and their maps update instantly to reflect that. Once enough people vote - it will be updated on everyones map.

How does the level thing work?

You earn RP for being active on the site but each action has an earning cooldown. High level members get extra powers, like reporting gym ownership and information.

I thought it said over 4 million locations?

There is! However it can only load upto 450 at a time, so zoom in to see them all.|||
