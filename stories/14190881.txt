E39DI postponed

 Our E3 DXpedition Team will go to Dahlak Archipelago as planned, but the stay there will be shortened due to a strong suggestion by the Eritrean Government. Hence, very unfortunately, we may not have sufficient time to operate from there this time. Instead we will do research on how we can operate next time, most probably in the fall of this year, studying the terrain, facilities available, accessibility and so on. We also hope the condition will become better in the autumn. So your understanding will be highly appreciated. Please note E31A operation will be conducted from Asmara as scheduled (May 19-29).

As informed before, our DXpedition team headed by Zorro - JH1AJT will operate in Eritrea from May 18 through 29, 2017.

 Please note the Call Sign previously announced for Asmara (“E31AA”) has been changed. The new one is “E31A”.

The Call Sign for Dahlak Archipelago(E39DI IOTA AF038) remains unchanged, and is scheduled to be operated for a couple of days only.

 Details will follow. Thank you for your attention.|||
