Based at Here East in London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and curated by ‘digital archeologist’ Jim Boulton, 64 Bits is a treasure trove of the internet’s lost relics.

Browse Tim Berners-Lee’s inaugural website yourself, search the web on the first ever search engine, Archie (from the Barbadian-born Alan Emtage), and peruse the world’s first web comic.

Hungry? Thirsty? Order a pizza on the first transactional website, and watch coffee brewed on the world’s first webcam.

There are even chances for you to get creative, designing your own digital city, and taking home your own ASCII portrait (an early image-making technique using letters, numbers and symbols – like the picture of Marilyn, above).|||

64 Bits, Here East: You're welcome 'Gen Y'.
