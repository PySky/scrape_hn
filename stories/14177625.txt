On macOS Emacs currently creates child processes using . It appears that this also copies GUI resources. The result is that forking takes about 30 times as long on Darwin than on Linux. And because Magit starts many processes even when doing simple things, that makes quite a difference.

Nobody knows when the changes on the branch will be released as , but it is still a long way off. You might want to get your hands on this change before then. The easiest way to get a patched Emacs is to install the formula 3 using .
