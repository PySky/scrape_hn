Today, April 7, 2017, is Bobby Henline's 10th year ALIVE DAY celebration. As his business partner, I am honored to share a story that he posted to his social media today. He continues to bless others with his humbleness and mission to give back to others, taking care of Veterans the world over. Thank you, Bobby! #HappyALIVEday #SoGladYouAreHere #Veterans #MissionHelpingVeterans

"As you know today is my 10th Alive Day. I wanted to do something extra special this year to remember my brothers and their service. You may have seen that I'm getting a service dog "Daisy" from Retrieving Freedom. Well I have donated some money to Retrieving Freedom and with that donation I get to name some service dogs that will grow up to serve a Veteran or a child with autism. Of course the names I've chosen are to honor my brothers and their families.

Diesel - for Rodney McCandless - he was a petroleum specialist

JJ - for Jon Grassbaugh for the love him and his wife Jenna shared for each other.

I'm also Honoring the service of my friend Jamie Neely Burton's son, Brian.

When your in war the sound of a helicopter can mean great news in many ways, like It could be much needed supply's, Air cover, back up troops to help get you out of a fire fight or medivac to save your life.

Jamie is that medivac for myself and other veterans off the battlefield.

Jamie has continued to serve others in honor of her son Brian.

Brian served in the KY national guard. A plane mechanic in the civilian world, Brian loved to fly. Jamie lost Brian at the young age of 24 when his plane went down just before getting his pilot license.

Since Jamie is my medivac and Brian loved to fly, I'm honoring Brian with a dog named Chopper.

The names are on a list now. As new puppies come in to get trained they will get named. I will keep all of you and the families up dated with pics and info as the dogs get named and train.|||
