The company, which relies on Apple for around half of its revenue, challenged the iPhone maker’s claims that it could do so without infringing Imagination’s patents.

“Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information,” Imagination said in a strongly-worded statement.

“This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU [graphics processing unit] architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights. Accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions.”

Imagination’s shares plunged by 61.6pc to 103p on Monday, their lowest level since 2009, on the prospect of losing income from its biggest customer, which analysts said could force it to be broken up and sold. It said that business with Apple had accounted for £60.1m of revenue last year, more than half of all sales, and was expected to rise to £65m this year.|||

Imagination Technologies has raised the prospect of a bitter legal battle with Apple after the US tech giant said it would ditch the company&rsquo;s microchip designs.
