Create a file named in the root directory of your project with these contents:

The is a recipe for building an image. The image then forms the base from which we later create the container that will run the tests.

The line sets the base image from which we derive our own image. We use the “official” Swift image in Dockerʼs public image repository. Itʼs a standard Ubuntu that has the Swift toolchain installed. You can use different tags (the part behind the colon) to select a specific Swift version, or for the latest version.

The subsequent lines create a working directory in the image and copy the contents of the project directory from the host (your machine) to the image. If you place your in a different directory than your project root, youʼll have to modify the paths in the line.

We then run and to fetch our packageʼs dependencies and create a clean slate for the build. Fetching the dependencies again is not strictly necessary as they also get copied over from the host, but itʼs good practice.

The last line, , specified the command we want to run when we run the container. In our case, we build the package and run the tests.|||
