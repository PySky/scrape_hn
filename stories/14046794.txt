When introducing the idea of using Neo4j within an enterprise one common assumption is that because Neo4j is a graph database it must not provide ACID-compliance that RDBMS has delivered for so long. This assumption isn’t unfounded considering most of the NoSQL database solutions have moved towards a performance and availability at all costs model. But it’s a fact: Neo4j is a fully ACID-compliant and transactional database intended to be a secure and safe source of truth database for your enterprise.

Neo4j is a reliable, scalable and high-performing native graph database that’s suitable for enterprise use. Its proper ACID characteristics is a foundation of data reliability. Neo4j ensures that operations involving the modification of data happen within a transaction to guarantee consistent data.

This is especially important in graph because the paradigm for writing data reliably shifts when you introduce the concept of a relationship that is a primary entity within the database. To write a relationship reliably requires locking both the nodes it’s connected to in order to guarantee that they both agree on that relationship between them.

In summary, Neo4j is an enterprise ready native graph database that is designed to be your source of truth transactional datastore. We’ve been using it in this way for years and so have many of the world’s leading enterprises.|||
