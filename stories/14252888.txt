Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs. Each patch is cryptographically signed with the signify(1) tool and contains usage instructions. All the following patches are also available in one tar.gz file for convenience.

Alternatively, the syspatch(8) utility can be used to apply binary updates on the following architectures: amd64, i386.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the -stable branch, which is maintained for one year after release.|||
