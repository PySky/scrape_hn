Update had never appeared in car, service center noted I was on old one and upgraded, but took three attempts due

to issues.

Installed at 9 PM, took 45 minutes in entirety. Have not driven as yet..

not clear why this update, maybe AS on 130 km/h now working

Update only came after i took the car to SC

Rebooted MCU and got update soon after.

I think I am AP1, therefore I am?

Staged at 6:15PM on 6th, install started at 1:44AM, completed at 2:05AM (EST).

Scheduled at 8PM for 100 min. Done at 9:40 PM

Required AP Recalib., Notification while car was at SC (they didn t install, though)

Updated from 17.16.35. Got Automatic Emergency Braking, autopilot up to 90mph, auto high-beams.

Upgraded from 17.9.3. Update took 40mins to install. Autosteer now at 80mph, got summon, lane departure warning and

other misc updates.

Better, but neither AS or TACC are yet at AP1 parity

Added local AS. TACC/AS on highway up to 90mph.

Got update while on vacation, installed right before road trip back home

Actually downloaded on Apr 26 while in service

Not sure if this was the exacte date

They did not install but it got it over their wifi

after I had driven the car for 5min|||
