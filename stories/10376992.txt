As Amazon wrapped up its 4th annual AWS re:Invent Conference last week, it became clear to me that the company is no longer just a developer platform; but rather a full-fledged enterprise company serving the needs of small businesses to Fortune 500 companies.

AWS is dominating the public cloud market, and it is increasingly clear that this market represents the largest disruption of enterprise computing since the introduction of the personal computer.

AWS is on a $10B run rate growing at 81% year over year.  They have thriving businesses in compute, storage and databases with emerging businesses in a range of areas across the enterprise software spectrum.

According to Baird, AWS will represent just 5% of data center spend this year and less than 1% of overall enterprise IT spend.  In other words, there is still significant room for growth as more enterprises embrace cloud technologies.  AWS’s scale advantages coupled with an impressive track record of innovation and huge aspirations have the company extremely well positioned for the next decade.

As a the conference wrapped up, rumors of Dell’s interest in buying EMC and their controlling interest in VMware hit the newswire.  EMC, the stalwart of on-premise enterprise storage, and VMware, the creator of virtualization and champion of server and data center consolidation – two of the most successful companies in data center infrastructure over the past decade – are on the block with their best days clearly behind them.

In contrast, AWS is ascending and dictating the corporate strategies of nearly all major enterprise IT vendors.  While Microsoft, IBM, et al have great assets to challenge in this market, it is clear that Amazon is driving the agenda for enterprise computing and is the most important enterprise IT company in the world today.|||
