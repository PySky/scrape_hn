ErRabbit(Error Rabbit) is useful error remote tracking service with Visual View. Collecting by Log4j, slf4j(by Plinio Freire) and ActiveMQ will make it easy compatible with other programs.

If you want to use slf4j refer this section

Because Default JMS Appender on Log4j1 did not support queue, ErRabbit made a custom appender. There is dependency for our custom appender.

You can collect all kind of log(info, debug, trace .. etc). But, for your application performance, use only as exception error logging.

and add repository for javax.jms (if maven can't find javax.jms)

ErRabbit uses Log4j2 JMS Appender, and collects exceptions with other information logs. You can collect all kind of log(info, debug, trace .. etc). But, for your application performance, use only as exception error logging.

If you have legacy logs which use JVM System.class (printstackstrace, System.out, System.err and etc), you can configure your application to wrap them to Log4j. Check more info on this wiki article.

There is other implementations by Plinio Freire(https://github.com/plinioasf)

We welcome anyone want to improve ErRabbit.|||
