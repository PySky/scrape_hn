Margin trading is now available on GDAX. Eligible customers can trade up to 3x leveraged orders on BTC, ETH, and LTC order books. To celebrate this launch there will be no fees to access margin trading.

Over the last few years, we have seen growing interest from institutions that desire advanced trading features. We are excited to launch a margin feature that meets the high demands of professional traders while addressing federal and state regulatory requirements. We believe this feature will attract a new wave of institutional clients, ultimately reducing volatility and supporting growth of the digital asset industry.

Our goal is to serve as the most trusted digital asset exchange for institutions and professional traders. Todayâ€™s launch, along with the introduction of the GDAX Trading Rules, represents an important step towards that goal and our commitment to creating a more transparent and fair market.
