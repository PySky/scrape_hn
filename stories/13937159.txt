A zero-emissions train that runs on just steam and condensed water has successfully completed its first test run in Germany.

The Coradia iLint is the world’s only fuel cell passenger train, according to its French makers Alstom, who design environmentally-friendly rail solutions.

Testing was carried out on the company’s own track in Salzgitter, Lower Saxony, with passenger test runs set to begin at the start of 2018.|||
