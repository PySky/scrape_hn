This week I had one university who wanted to get a few hundred TB of data into the Azure cloud.

Well now Azure customers,  can now arrange to have their hard drives transported to Microsoft’s data centres in the UK and uploaded using the Azure Data Import and Export services.



Allows the upload of hard drive to the cloud, which is in some cases can be faster, cheaper and more secure for institutions than moving data via an internet connection.



You pay a flat fee to transport your drive via a courier to one of the UK data centres. The information is then uploaded to the cloud and the hard drive is couriered back to you. Charges to store the information in the cloud then apply.

Everything you need to know about Microsoft Cloud:

Microsoft opened its UK data centres in September last year. Since then, thousands of customers, including the Ministry of Defence, the Met Police, parts of the NHS and Centrica, have signed up to take advantage of the sites, which offer UK data residency, security and reliability.|||
