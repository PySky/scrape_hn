Today, IBM announced that Ubisoft®’s Star Trek™: Bridge Crew, a new virtual reality game, will include IBM Watson’s interactive speech and cognitive capabilities.

The feature will be available later this summer during an experimental Beta period following the game’s launch this May. With IBM Watson, Star Trek™: Bridge Crew will provide players the opportunity to use their voice and natural-language commands to interact with their virtual Starfleet crew members.

This feature is part of a strategic partnership with Ubisoft®, a leading creator, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment and services.

IBM’s new “VR Speech Sandbox,” the software used to build the Star Trek™: Bridge Crew feature, is now available for all developers to adapt for their own virtual reality (VR) applications and services.|||
