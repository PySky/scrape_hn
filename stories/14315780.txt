The modern automotive cockpit is sophisticated and loaded with smart technologies; however, it has little value if the driver finds it difficult to use. Existing smart in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) interfaces have greatly improved the cockpit experience, but voice to date has not delivered on its potential to bridge the gap between hands-free, in-vehicle control and safer driving. Motivation from users for in-vehicle voice interfaces has never been higher. According to the 2016 KPCB Internet Trends Report, over 60% of respondents use voice when their hands are occupied. In the U.S., 36% of respondents reported that the car was their primary setting for voice usage. Yet existing systems are problematic as they are known to be unreliable, which has resulted in user abandonment and a broad based level of dissatisfaction. In 2015, the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study found that the rate of complaints for in-car voice recognition systems is nearly four times the rate of reported problems with  transmissions. Drivers as well as passengers seek on-demand, real-time voice controls that match high accuracy with easy operability and reliability. Therefore, a new model of voice operation is required.

“Voice-activated command systems and their software often are badly outdated or unreliable, leading to a tide of customer complaints and research questioning how safe they really are.” The Wall Street Journal
