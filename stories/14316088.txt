We received the following statement on 11th May from Guidance Software which we will leave uncommented as we are still bewildered about it:

 



"We are aware and appreciate the issues raised by SEC Consult. The exploit SEC Consult claims to have found is an extreme edge case, much like the theoretical alerts they tried to promote in November. As always, we continue to examine alerts when they are submitted and apply changes to our systems as necessary.

 

 Our products give investigators access to raw data on a disk so they can have complete access to all the information.  Dealing with raw data means there are times when malformed code can cause a crash or other issue on an investigator’s machine. We train users for the possibility of potential events like this and always recommend that they isolate their examination computers. After almost 20 years building forensic investigation software that is field-tested and court-proven, we find that the benefits of complete, bit-level visibility far outweigh the inconvenience of a very limited number of scenarios like this. If an issue does arise, it is something we work directly with the customer to resolve.

 

 The nature of our business is dealing with raw data, and that has risk. We will continue to modify our software as necessary to deal with the continually changing environment. If necessary, we will take action and inform our customers. We do not consider this claim to be serious and it will not impact the performance of our products. "|||
