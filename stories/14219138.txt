Manifold is an intuitive, collaborative platform for scholarly publishing. With iterative texts, powerful annotation tools, rich media support, and robust community dialogue, Manifold transforms scholarly publications into living digital works.

The Manifold team will use this blog to document the process of creating Manifold Scholarship, a project at the University of Minnesota Press in partnership with the GC Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center, CUNY and Cast Iron Coding. Manifold Scholarship is funded through a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

For an introduction to the project, please read “Building Manifold,” by Project Co-PIs Doug Armato and Matthew K. Gold, and to learn more about the technology behind the project, please read “A Technical Introduction to Manifold” by Cast Iron Coding principle Zach Davis.
