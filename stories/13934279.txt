GNOME 3.24 is the latest version of GNOME 3, and is the result of 6 months’ hard work by the GNOME community. It contains major new features, as well as many smaller improvements and bug fixes. In total, the release incorporates 28459 changes, made by approximately 753 contributors.

3.24 has been named “Portland” in recognition of last year’s LAS GNOME Summit, which was held in Portland, Oregon. GNOME’s events are only possible due to the amazing work of local volunteers. This new event was the first of its kind, and brought together community members and partners on the US West Coast. Thank you, team LAS!|||
