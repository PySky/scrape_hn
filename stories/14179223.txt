TriFusion is a modern GUI and command line application designed to make the life of anyone with proteome and/or alignment sequence data easier and more pleasurable. Regardless of your experience in bioinformatics, TriFusion is easy to use and offers a wide array of powerfull features to help you deal with your data. At the same time, it was developed to handle the enormous amount of data that is generated nowadays.

TriFusion is an open source, cross-platform application written in Python 2.7 and using the Kivy framework to build the graphical interface.
