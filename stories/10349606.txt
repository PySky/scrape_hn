A source code for jailbreaking iPhone and iPad running on iOS 8.4.1 is now available on Github. A student from Italy named Luca Todesco has released this tool as an open source code for anyone interested in getting their iOS 8.4.1 jailbroken.

Before you run off to get Yalu, the source code for iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak from Todesco’s Github page, keep in mind that there are some limitations and it’s not useable for everyone yet. First of all, this source code required users with technical skills rather than anyone because it’s not a one-click jailbreak tool yet. Todesco also noted on the description that Yalu is not entirely completed.

It looks like that there will be a jailbreak tool based on this source code and the developer behind Yalu is planning on to release it.

Some interesting tweets we’ve collected from his Twitter page.

Only thing that’s really left to do is to use dyldmagic to overwrite amfid’s lazy symbol table.

OpenSSH is fine.

An iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak is highly possible in the near future and so you should not upgrade to iOS 9 at this moment if interested in getting your iPhone or iPad jailbroken. Once you upgraded to Apple latest firmware, you will not be able to downgrade back since the signing windows has been closed.

We will get more information and give you the latest update on Yalu as well as any upcoming iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak tool.|||
