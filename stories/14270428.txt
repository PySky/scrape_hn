I had heard the rumblings of this awesome new deployment tool zeit, but had not tried it out. Then, I heard Guillermo Rauch talking about it on hanselminutes.

I was taking a break from work, so I decided to see what the big deal is about and then when I tried it:

Installation is pretty smooth, especially if you have node installed:

In the hanselminutes episode Guillermo and Scott talk about proven industry practices that can be used readily as conventions without going through with the (NIH) syndrome.

Guillermo and team nailed that in the experience as well, no more going through the signup process.

I ran the executable to try it for the first time, it asked for my email address, sent an activation email with a security code to it almost immediately.

Clicking the link automatically activated the now instance.

After browsing quickly through their website, I created a directory with just an index.html file containing just a h1 Hello World!

I ran now and bam!, my static html was instantly available:

It even copies the url to the clipboard automatically!

Opened up the browser and there it was, in all its static html glory, accessible to the whole world and that too with a verified certificate.

zeit defaults you to the oss plan, the comparison and pricing page is here.

To see which deployments are running:

Every time you run now without any arguments it will create a brand new instance for you.

When I saw what the python cloud deployment framework zappa could do, I was amazed and liked that a lot.

This, this is something else.|||
