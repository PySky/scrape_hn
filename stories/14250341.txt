1.It’s a cool time to be in digital publishing. We’ve both been growing with Medium, becoming two of the faster growing tech publications across the internet. I’ve read many great posts on freeCodeCamp. I liked how Medium cleared a lot noise from the reading and publishing experiences. Most pages on the internet are just too busy. What I’m getting at, there’s a lot of tech that goes into how a blog functions and evolves. To develop and grow digital publications, what future technology — or ways of applying existing technology — are you excited about?

2. How did you get the idea to invite nonprofits to submit projects for learners to code on — and how central has that idea become to your business? I must say, it’s a creative way to connect free education and students adding value to world.

3. So you’ve seen me around the internet but we’ve never met in person. You see some of what I’m working on, really focused on growing a network of blogs & publications, AMI. For me or someone else out there who’s interested in scaling a media company, what advice do you have?
