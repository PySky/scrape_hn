Another few weeks, another drone video of the construction progress on Apple’s ginormous new campus.

This time, via 9to5Mac, the video was shot with a DJI Phantom 3 Professional and posted to YouTube by MyithZ. Updates on the construction process from September include “huge glass panels in the staging area close to the metal sections,” and footage that shows that the “circular Campus 2 building is really taking shape now above ground level.”

Professional drone operators and videographers are going nuts shooting this thing. Last month, we posted this awesome video shot on Aug. 1. As the campus is not set to open until late in 2016, it’s safe to say that we can expect quite a few more of these drone-shot perspectives.

Watch both and see if you can spot the updates.
