As well as being incredibly fascinating, quantum mechanics is also set to revolutionize the fields of information theory and computation. There exist certain problems that could be solved using a quantum computer in many fewer steps than is possible with a classical computer. One of the key explanations of why this is the case is Shor's factoring algorithm, which was formulated by the US mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. In this short video, Shor introduces his eponymous mathematical concept.
