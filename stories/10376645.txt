Andy Rubin created the most popular mobile operating system in the world, went to work for Google, left Google and then founded his own startup incubator. What does he think comes next for mobile?

Onstage at the Code/Mobile conference at The Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif., he shared some of the ideas he thinks could spark “10 more Androids.”

A lot of his thinking is centered on artificial intelligence, “some form” of which he thinks will power the next revolution in computing. It’s also where his hardware incubator — Playground Global — is putting a bunch of the $300 million round that it recently closed.

Rubin talked about China, the nuances of Android and more; you can watch the full video of his conversation with Walt Mossberg below:|||
