To start making money on YouTube you will need to monetize your YouTube channel and associate it with an approved AdSense account to start earning. Not all videos are eligible for monetization, you must meet video monetization criteria and YouTube Advertising formats to benefit from this service. This is the direct way to earn money from YouTube videos.

One of the biggest YouTubers is Olga Kay. Recently, in the New York Times, she revealed that she earned $100k -$130k from YouTube annually over the last three years. This translates to $8,300 - $10,800 per month, which of course is good money! This makes her one of the richest YouTube users.

To maximize your revenue you will need to upload videos to YouTube that attract a high volume of traffic because you make money when someone views your video. Are wondering “how much do YouTubers make per view?” well, they on average make 0.5 -2 dollars for ever 1k video views. The secret to success is making videos that are highly appealing to viewers. YouTuber salary varies from one user to another depending on their efforts to publicize their channel.

To get more views and make more money on YouTube you need to market your videos on other sites, such as a personal blog or website and other social media or video sites. Embedding the video or sharing the link on the internet increases chances of getting noticed.

Once you have monetized your content with high volume of traffic, you may apply to become a YouTube partner. If granted partnership you will gain access to a large variety of content creation tools, and get an opportunity to win prizes for the number of views you have. You can apply for the membership anytime, but to get top rated partner programs, you should have accumulated 15k hours over the last 3 months.  Before making the application view YouTube channel stats to know your eligibility.

I guess you may be wondering how many YouTube subscribers you need to make money. Well, it is not really the number of subscribers that matters but the number of viewers and YouTube pay per view. However, it will be logical to argue that someone with say 10,000 subscribers has higher chances of getting 1,000 views than someone with 1,000 subscribers.  Also, advertisers only pay when subscribers click ads or watch a video for half a minute. This means if your video gets a million views but no one clicks the ads, you won’t make any money.

You need an active YouTube subscription to get more clicks which will only be possible if you post catchy content, and get a high YouTube rank that will improve aspects such as visibility when people look up YouTube.

YouTube Analytics provide a wide range of reports and metrics for you to monitor the progress of your videos and channel. Data on a variety of YouTube stats and reports including Traffic sources, Watch time, and Demographics reports is available. You can use your computer or mobile device to view the metrics.

YouTube view statistics update you on your account’s earning, and you will only be paid if you fully comply with YouTube’s payment threshold.

Other ways to make money on YouTube

Everywhere on the internet we find information that making money on YouTube is as easy as posting videos, generating traffic, and cashing in on ad-based revenue. This is a myth, because practically you cannot make steady, healthy revenue based only on YouTube money per view (ad revenue).  Realistically, you only make a few thousand dollars for a million views, and getting a million views is no simple task. You may eventually realize the need to generate revenue via other means.

One of the commonest opportunities for making money online is affiliate marketing, yet most affiliate marketers aren’t putting enough effort to generate enough revenue.

Just like most affiliate marketers, you may be using static blogs to drive traffic to affiliate links, but you can supplement this with a lively YouTube channel that you can use as a primary catalyst. The internet is gradually moving toward video as the major form of content, and taking this step will put you ahead of time as you will begin benefitting now.

Other than ad revenue, other ways to make money on YouTube include attracting sponsorships and transitioning into live speaking engagements.
