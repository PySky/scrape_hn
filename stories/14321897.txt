It is composed of a slew of core and secondary services which have their own scaling requirements, their own data sources, and are built, deployed, and managed autonomously via automated pipelines.

The services that comprise the game have changed over time. We started with a few coarse services, and revised and decomposed these as our early ideas solidified into distinct units.

We know, this doesn’t feel very business-y. But we’ve found that people are less likely to take risks in trying new technologies when they have their serious business hats on. That, and firm associations with existing applications can anchor thinking to traditional approaches. Anchored thinking causes problems when trying to understand how you might design a microservice around a business function or domain instead of around a data model.|||

gameon-gitbook: Game On! is a text-based adventure game designed to allow experimentation with microservices and supporting technologies.
