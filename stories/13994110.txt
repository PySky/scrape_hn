Today we'll write a few scripts that parse the plain text version of the book Alice in Wonderland, and generate simple statistics.

Read more if you want to see my solutions.

The following are the solutions I came up with. I tried to be as verbose as possible. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me.

I recommend using ExplainShell to understand commands / flags you've never seen before.

Also, my solutions use awk, sed & grep extensively. If you don't understand an expression, try regular expressions 101, It'll make your life easier.

Furthermore, If you've never heard or understand regular expressions, learn them. They are extremely powerful. You can start by reading my blog post about them.

Splits each chapter in the book into a dedicated file under the 'chapters' directory. There should be 12 chapters when you're done.

Generates statistics for the whole book, and each chapter:

Find the amount of words that their length is bigger than the average word length in the entire book.

Find the "closest" word to "Alice" - the most frequently used word that appeared right before or after the word "Alice".|||
