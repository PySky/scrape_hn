In the previous articles, we have explained what we need to make our own GitHub bot, using libraries from the open source community. Today, I want to share with you a minimalist but fully-functional bot: WelcomeBot!

The sum up what I expect from WelcomeBot:

Very simple and useful right ?

To do our own bot, we have to know two kind of information: the events from GitHub we need to listen and the information we extract from them.

Regarding our bot, and the documentation of GitHub API v3, we will listen two events:

We also need to know if a GitHub user have already contributed to the project:

Finally, we need to be able to comment on a contribution (pull request or issue) but we have already done this feature in a previous article.

You can do it in PHP and using the GitHub back office, using the “Webhooks” section:

Using PHP and the GitHub event parser library, events can be filtered more precisely:

This way we ensure to not deal with any others events and we limit the useless calls to the bot. As you may note, we have re-used an improved version of the “event listener” used in Article 1.

We will also re-use and improve the client we have done in Article 2.

Regarding the documentation of KnpLabs GitHub client, we can easily get the information:

Let’s take a look to the produced code:

We finally setup our own parametersto make this bot works, and configure the webhook url endpoint in GitHub like I did for my testing repository:

And, as always, this is the complete fully functional project:

Consider this code open source: you can use it, play with it and create your owns bots for GitHub!

Thank you for reading, this series of articles is now finished and I was happy to share this information with you. If you want to see a real and complete application of GitHub bot, you can take a look to PrestonBot, the community bot of PrestaShop project.
