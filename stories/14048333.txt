Huawei has quietly launched a new Smartphone, Y5 2017, which is considered to be the successor to Huawei Y5 II that was announced last year. Yes, though there was no official launch event or a press release, the company has just added the phone to their products list on its website, right away. This might be due to the fact that it is an entry-level device.

Only the specs are circulating around, but the pricing details and its availability is still unknown. Let’s have a quick glance on the specs of the Huawei Y5.

It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow layered with EMUI 4.1, which is very much outdated for today’s world. However, it is very doubtful that it would receive the latest version, Nougat in future.

In terms of specs – it is equipped with a 5-inch HD display with a resolution of 1280 x 720.  This device comes with a MediaTek MT6737 Quad-Core processor, which is clocked at 1.4GHz. In terms of memory capacity, the Y5 2017 is packed with 2GB of RAM and 16GB internal storage capacity, which is expandable up-to 128GB through Micro SD slot. It comprises a dual SIM card option.

It sports a 5MP camera for front-snapper, which is assisted by LED flash light; and an 8MP rear camera that is equipped with 84 degree wide angle lens. In addition to that, the connectivity options include 4G LTE, Bluetooth, GPS, etc.

It is shipped with 3,000mAh battery, which remains up even for 1.5 days after a single charge. The company claims that the removable battery has a smart power-saving technology to deliver 80% of charging to avoid battery replacement even after 800 charging cycles.

The device is 8.45mm thin and is designed with a textured body and curvy lines. The back design is featured with unique CD-style pattern around the camera lens and the bottom part is given a finishing by the CNC crafting process.|||
