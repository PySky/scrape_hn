DFAB is a 3D printer developed for dentists and prosthodontists with the purpose of increasing the efficiency and reducing the number of procedures for the production of dental prosthesis. It allows to produce up to 5-element bridges in less than 20 minutes. DFAB embeds the Photoshade technology, a system that allows to reproduce the colour of the patient’s teeth, as well as shades, giving the prosthesis a natural appearance.

Starting from an .stl file, elaborated after an intraoral scan, the user selects colours and shades of the restoration through Nauta Photoshade software. The choice of the shades and of the colours can be selected in a range between A1 and A3.5 of the Vita*1 scale; as a result, the finished product obtained is customized.

DFAB is an integrated system with disposable cartridges containing Temporis*2, the Class IIa biocompatible material. Recent studies and tests on this material have shown mechanical strength values that are comparable to a well-established restorative resin material made of hybrid composite*3. The cartridges are ready to use and conceived to maintain the workplace hygiene, avoiding the risk of accidental leakage and contamination. Compared to the traditional systems, the disposable cartridge allows an easy material change and prevents unnecessary cleaning and maintenance of platform and resin tank.

With a 40-micron laser spot, DFAB ensures an accurate fitting and a correct occlusion. The high speed printing guarantees a 20-minute building time of a 5-element bridge, providing a treatment that could be completed in a single visit, without the involvement of external dental labs. It is available in desktop and chairside version with a 7’ touch-screen computer.|||
