A new study by the Italian operator SosTariffe has revealed which popular messenger app consumes the least amount of mobile data. The applications tested included WhatsApp, Hangouts, Line, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. The study included three scenarios, light consumption, medium consumption, and heavy consumption, and compared how each app fared over a one hour time frame.

In the study, the different consumption level parameters were as follows:

As you can see from the table of results, Telegram and WhatsApp performed best, while Facebook Messenger, Viber, and Skype hogged a lot of data, especially as the consumption levels increased.

Studies such as these are nice to have, because they give users a good idea of how much data their apps are using on increasingly data-restricted networks. By using these statistics, users can make a more informed decision about which messaging platform to use going forward, and thus which one will help them conserve data.|||
