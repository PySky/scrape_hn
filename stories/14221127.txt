Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001 - but Donald Trump said surprisingly little about it in his first few weeks. 



On the campaign trail, he repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a "disaster" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. 



But after a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Ashraf Ghani in December, officials in Kabul said President Trump had agreed to consider bolstering the US contingent there. 



There are no signs that Mr Trump will be sending more troops to Afghanistan in the immediate future, but the US has taken significant military action there in recent weeks. 



On the 12 April, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).



Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for "another successful job". 



Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a "testing ground for new and dangerous weapons". 



Although Mr Trump has only spoken to President Ghani once since coming into office, he has said that he intends to meet with his Afghan counterpart in the near future.
