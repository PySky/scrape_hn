It's a Chrome extension which blocks requests to websites which use Internationalized domain name. In short, it allows users to use non-ASCII based alphabets in domain names.

It is useful. There's a lot of people out there who don't use the Latin alphabet and there's no valid reason why we should force them to use it.

Because unless you're one of those people, it only opens possibilities for IDN homograph attacks. These kind of spoofing attacks have been demonstrated in the past and recently popped up again demonstrating there're still cases where browsers cannot protect the user.

It is. My hope is that browsers will soon figure out a solution to this and the extension will not be needed. If you need more control, there're other extensions you might want to look into (untested):

You can download the extension directly from the store via chrome-ext-downloader and see for yourself.

Once installed, it should no longer be possible to open pages such as https://www.xn--e1awd7f.com or https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com.

Well, it's my first Chrome extension after all! But seriously should that ever happen, please open an issue or let me have it on Twitter @jiripospisil.|||
