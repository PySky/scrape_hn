You can use the transform to work with template snippets that are stored separately from the main AWS CloudFormation template. When you specify and the parameter, the key is a placeholder where snippets are injected. AWS CloudFormation inserts those snippets into your main template when Creating a Change Set or Updating Stacks Using Change Sets.

You might have a Lambda function that you want to reuse in one or more AWS CloudFormation templates. The transform lets you create a reference to a transform snippet in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can add to the function in your AWS CloudFormation template. The function behaves similarly to an , , or directive in programming languages.

You can use the transform anywhere within the AWS CloudFormation template except in the template parameters section or the template version field. For example, you can use in the mappings section.

To include a transform at the top level of a template, use the following syntax.

To include a transform that is embedded within a section, use the following syntax.

The location is an Amazon S3 URI, with a specific file name in an S3 bucket. For example, .

When using , keep the following in mind:

The following example shows how to use the transform to execute a wait condition handle.

Both the JSON and the YAML versions use the following wait condition snippet. Save the file as , and store it in an S3 bucket with the same name as .|||
