Why I Will Never Buy Another Dell Product Again

With income tax season on its way, I figured I would treat myself to a shiny new monitor for making my time working at home and on personal projects even more pleasant that it already was. Before, I was rocking an old 27-inch Samsung display with 1080p resolution, which didn’t offer the same real estate as the glorious 1440p Thunderbolt display at the office.

So, with any electronics purchase, I immediately jumped onto The Wirecutter to see what they had to recommend. Lo and behold, their #1 recommendation was the Dell U2715H (at the time), but they also mentioned they were still reviewing its successor, the U2717D.

He immediately approved the return request and asked for a shipping address to send the replacement to, and said the replacement would be there in 2 days. Great, that was painless! Wow, Dell’s support is really on top of things!|||
