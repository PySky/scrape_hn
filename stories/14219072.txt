The rise of Donald Trump began a debate about the proper place of nationalism in American politics. A growing chorus on the political right, including even many who opposed his candidacy, has been praising the president’s America First agenda as a healthy restoration of nationalism and fleshing out an intellectual framework to fit his worldview. It is right to give his ideas serious and thoughtful examination, as it is to consider any ideas that seek to protect our country and unite its people. But there are good ways and bad ways to pursue these goals, ways that stay true to the ideals on which this country was founded and ways that do not.
The center-right in particular is engaged in a civil war of sorts over the issue. Much of its leadership​—​politicians, intellectuals, and commentators alike​—​were so vociferously opposed to what candidate Trump advocated that they formed the NeverTrump movement to stop him. Faced with his electoral victory, many have split off and sought accommodation with the president's views. Conservative outlets like National Review and the Washington Free Beacon​—​never before within Trump's orbit​—​have led the way, publishing pieces that aim to bridge the gap between the formerly Never-Trump center-right and the intellectual organs of Trumpian nationalism, exemplified both by the new journal American Affairs and by older conservative stalwarts like Pat Buchanan.
