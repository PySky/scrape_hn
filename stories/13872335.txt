DNSControl is a system for maintaining DNS zones. It has two parts: a domain specific language (DSL) for describing DNS zones plus software that processes the DSL and pushes the resulting zones to DNS providers such as Route53, CloudFlare, and Gandi. It can talk to Microsoft ActiveDirectory and it generates the most beautiful BIND zone files ever. It runs anywhere Go runs (Linux, macOS, Windows). The provider model is extensible, so more providers can be added.

At Stack Overflow, we use this system to manage hundreds of domains and subdomains across multiple registrars and DNS providers.

You can think of it as a DNS compiler. The configuration files are written in a DSL that looks a lot like JavaScript. It is compiled to an intermediate representation (IR). Compiler back-ends use the IR to update your DNS zones on services such as Route53, CloudFlare, and Gandi, or systems such as BIND and ActiveDirectory.

Running will talk to the providers (here name.com as registrar and route 53 as the dns host), and determine what changes need to be made.

Running will make those changes with the provider and my dns records will be correctly updated.

See Getting Started page on documentation site.

This command will download the source code, compile it, and put the resulting binary in|||
