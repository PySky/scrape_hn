The Centre will put in place a special dispensation or US-plus team to speed up investments from top IT giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Apple, all of whom have pledged to join the Digital India bandwagon.A two-member American team may be drafted into ministry of communications & information technology to pick up the ropes after the prime minister’s meetings with top honchos from five technology giants last week in the US.The two US officials likely to be drafted here would coordinate with prime minister’s principal secretary Nripendra Misra to deal with issues from time to time.During UPA regime, the then principal secretary to prime minister, TKA Nair was the point man for realising Japanese investments. Since it failed to materialise large Japanese investments, Modi had convinced his Japanese counterpart to draft two officials in the industry and commerce ministry here to realise FDI from Japan. Like ‘Japan-plus’, the Modi government will initiate ‘US-plus’ to realise investment and technology commitments made by American technology giants.Five major investment and technology commitments are expected to anchor the ‘digital India’ campaign announced by the prime minister last year. For instance, US officials will have to link up with the railway board to implement Google chief Sundar Pichai’s announcement to introduce internet services in 500 railway stations this year and later double this number.The US-plus team would also hold the key for Microsoft’s Satya Nadella to rollout low-cost broadband connectivity in over five lakh villages in India. Nadella’s office would, in all probability, be linked up with US plus team in India to also provide cloud services via Indian data centres.“We believe low-cost broadband connectivity coupled with the scale of cloud computing and intelligence that can be harnessed from data, can help drive creativity, efficiency and productivity across governments and businesses of all size. This, in turn, will create global opportunities for India,” Nadella said last week.This special dispensation in India will hold talks with Apple chief executive Tim Cook to expand the latter’s network and persuade him to set up an Apple phone manufacturing unit in India. Modi has already invited Cook to set up an Apple manufacturing unit in India.The high profile investment proposal needs to be followed up with Qualcomm executive chairman Paul E Jacob to realise promised investments worth Rs 1,000 crore to boost startups in India. Jacob had declared in San Jose after meeting Modi that the company shares his vision to “transform India into a digitally-empowered society and knowledge economy”. Jacob had also announced setting design houses in India for product innovation.Facebook’s Mark Zuck­er­berg’s announcement to expand the company’s philanthropic activities in India would also be coordinated by the US-Plus team.While these top five companies have made specific announcements, other players following suit would be hand-held by US-Plus special dispensation team, a top official involved in following up with PM’s US visit told Financial Chronicle.The induction of officials from the ministry of economy, trade and industry (METI) of Japan has led to positive investments from Tokyo, the official added. METI officials have been handholding small and medium enterprises as well as mid-sized companies to set up bases in India to serve large players like Suzuki, Hitachi and Sansui.In a similar vein, US officials to be drafted into the ministry of information technology & communications would also become the link with big and small companies in the country.This arrangement will be akin to the special management team set up to fast-track investments from Japan after Modi held two summit-level meetings with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, last year.|||
