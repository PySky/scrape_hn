Gratipay is co-organizing the first SustainOSS conference, to be held at GitHub in San Francisco on June 19. We’re aiming for “a one-day conversation for open source software sustainers,” a term coined recently by Justin Dorfman to describe people who care deeply about the health of the open source ecosystem.

The organizers want the event to be participatory without running afoul of the tyranny of structurelessness, so we invited a highly regarded facilitator, Allen “Gunner” Gunn, to guide us. Gunner has asked participants to start thinking about the narratives we see this event fitting within, and the outcomes we’d like to achieve.

For my part, I see two narrative arcs to locate this day within, two ongoing culture shifts:

The immediate outcome I’d like to see from Sustain is a community and shared identity around the issue of open source sustainability. Docs geeks have Write the Docs. Maintainers have Maintainerati. Now sustainers will have Sustain. The larger outcome will be for this new-found community to keep evolving open organizations, and evolving empathy in closed ones.

Gratipay is excited to participate in Sustain, because these outcomes serve our own mission, to cultivate an economy of gratitude, generosity, and love. Register now to join us in June, and find us in #sustain on the Changelog Slack to collaborate in organizing the event.|||
