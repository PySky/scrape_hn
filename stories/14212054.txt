Most of the DAW interfaces often seem overcomplicated, and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Also most of the DAWs are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio aims to be a modern music creation tool, featuring linear-based sequencer with a clean interface, high-performance C++ core, integrated version control providing intelligent synchronization between devices, saved undo history, translations to many languages and more.

Helio is a work in progress and still there are many essential features missing, so pull requests are appreciated.

Your ideas are also welcome: friendly and lightweight UI is the main development priority in this project, and if you have a vision on how to improve user experience in music composing, feel free to share it.

You could also make a new translation for your native language or improve any of existing translations, which include English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Russian.
