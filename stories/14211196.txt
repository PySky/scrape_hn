Gruvi is an IO library for Python. It uses libuv (via pyuv) as the underlying high-performance event-based I/O layer, and coroutines based on fibers to create a traditional sequential programming model on top of the libuv completion/callback based model.

Gruvi is similar in concept to asyncio, gevent, and eventlet. For a rationale on why I've created a new library, see the Rationale section in the manual.

Gruvi has the following features:

You need Python 2.7 or 3.3+.

The following operating systems are currently supported:

For other installation options, see the Installation section in the manual.

The documentation is available on readthedocs.

Gruvi is free software, provided under the MIT license.
