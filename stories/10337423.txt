WHAT IS A BUSINESS PLAN AND WHY DO YOU NEED ONE?

A business plan (BP) is a paper that presents a certain idea, the way it will be implemented, and what it takes to do it. Any entrepreneur who wants to have his or her company running has to have a BP. No architect starts building a skyscraper without blueprints and calculations. Otherwise, the building eventually falls apart and damages everyone who was involved in a project execution and put time and money into it. In the case of a company, a BP is a lifesaving blueprint that helps to keep businesses from major failures. Every successful company has started from a BP or, in case it was lucky enough to get going without one, created it later to have a clear vision of the next steps that have to be taken to continue growing and prospering. Therefore, if you are a newbie in a business world, you need to have a really good plan to survive in highly competitive market conditions. There are numerous types of BPs. Each one has to be thought-out and organized extremely well. Whether you write it for yourself, or to attract partners and investors, you need to prepare it as if your life depends on it. You future definitely does, so it is important to know the things you have to consider. This outline will help you not only to structure the paper or a presentation, but also to understand and research key elements that will make up your business: Executive summary - shortly overviews the entire work, mentioning only key points and focusing on the details that are the most important to present. Company Summary - describes the company, presents the name, the logo, the location, and the story behind the idea. Product/Service - tells readers what you are selling; shows the problem you are solving for your customers and the way you do it. Market analysis - presents your research of the market, main competitors, and shows how you fit the niche. Strategy - indicates the actions you will be taking to run a company and serve the clients. Management - presents the team that will execute the plan and proves their credibility by providing a description of their professional background. Risks - expose possible problems that can occur at the implementation stage and your ways of avoiding or coping with them. Milestones - determine goals and exact dates they will be achieved. Finances - show approximate expenses and expected revenue, justifying each point with calculations and explanations. Appendices - include information or calculations that can be referred to in a plan, but are too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper. All these sections are important to consider if you want to implement your idea confidently and qualitatively. However, not all parts should necessarily be in your BP. It is crucial to adjust it to the intended audience, and you may exclude some of the points if your readers find them redundant. It is recommended to examine each section in details for yourself and make notes or a draft of a business plan essay, so to say, to get a glance of a big picture and have some material to write the plan you need afterward. You can look up BPs of large and prosperous companies to understand how they have executed their ideas. Some of them will help you organize and present your plan better, and understand what parts you might be missing. If you cannot do a good research or are failing to calculate expenses, our specialists are always here to help you out. Pro-Papers has numerous experts that can work on any section of your paper and provide you with credible data. Do not hesitate to place an order and consult our professional business plan writers to make your work perfect.

Do you have everything to build a successful business? If you do not have a BP, then the answer is negative. No smart person would put money and effort into a project that has no future. And how can you know it does if you have not thought about it in details? Every entrepreneur has an idea. However, even the best idea is useless without a good implementation plan. Business is all about execution, not a concept, and, therefore, if you want your employees, partners, and investors believe that you are a real businessperson, you need a solid plan. “What can help me with my business plan?” you may ask. A set of the understandable and smart guidelines from the specialists, of course! For your convenience, Pro-Papers has gathered the most useful tips to show you the best way to write a business plan. The thing all of the BPs start with is an executive summary. However, it is better to start writing it when you already have all important information on the paper and are ready to recap it. This section is considered one of the most significant as this is the first, and often the last thing people see while reading a plan. If you are trying to attract investors, you need to understand that you are not the only entrepreneur who is trying to do it, and investors do not have time to read all twenty pages of your plan. The only thing that can tell them about your idea briefly is an executive summary, and if it looks appealing and convincing, your papers get into the "yes" pile and may even be read fully afterward. Therefore, if you want to make a good first impression and stand out in the crowd of other venturers, you have to spend a decent amount of time preparing a great executive summary. Another thing important to focus on is a product or a service you will be selling. It is crucial to prove that people actually need what you offer, and you will be able to make money out of it. The good you are selling has to solve a certain problem on the market in a way no one has done it before. You have to present a demand, solutions that other companies have, and finally show yours and demonstrate how exactly they are different and better than the others. The market analysis will also prove the information you are presenting with the help of numbers and examples. This is a section, which shows that your idea is actual, and the whole project is feasible and will be profitable for you, your partners and investors if they contribute. Here you have to focus on the market and the place you are planning to take in it. It is important to show the key competitors and the ways you are going to turn their assaults back, to make everyone believe that your company will be compatible enough to survive and prosper even under the worst circumstances. Most of the investors will also want to see your strategy. It has to include your daily operations to serve clients and maintain the whole company. You may want to make a separate operational BP that will explain how you are planning to run a company in details and present even elementary actions that will be taken by each member of your team daily. Also, you have to show the goals you are willing to achieve and the ways you are going to make it. Present the milestones and describe each one with numbers, dates, and examples, to make it evident that you see your company's future and know what you will do to bring aims to life. It will be great if you include possible risks and then explain how you will deal with them. This information will show that you have researched the market properly and are ready to enter it. The section that most entrepreneurs find the hardest is finances. Some of them are either failing to present realistic data or trying too hard to calculate everything precisely. The truth is that numbers you will get after calculations will not be accurate. It is impossible to predict actual expenses and revenue. However, it does not mean you have to leave them out. Finance is a language of business, and you need to speak it fluently to be a good entrepreneur. As you cannot just play with numbers and make wild guesses, it is better to have info that will slightly differ from real, but will still help you on your way of building your own company. Implementing a BP is never cheap, and if you are attracting investors, they have to see how you will spend their money and if they can expect income from your project. The section that many investors find extremely important is management. Here, you have to present the team that will help you implement your project. These have to be credible specialists with professional background and outstanding abilities. Usually, a great team is a key to successful project implementation. Therefore, you have to present people, who will play the main role in a project execution, in the best light. If some of them worked in well-known companies or have stellar qualifications, this information will get you a sympathy of numerous investors. If some of them have only skills to show, try to present such people as geniuses with fresh and creative approaches. As you can see, it is extremely hard to write a great BP, especially, if you have not done it before. However, your time and efforts will pay off in spades, as there is a better chance that your idea will work and make you rich if you think the execution through. If you want to speed up the process and focus on the things you find more important, willing to find a specialist to “write my business plan for me”, leave the paperwork to professionals. Let Pro-Papers experts make your BP perfect and help your dreams come to life.

THE IMPORTANCE OF WRITING A ONE PAGE BUSINESS PLAN SUCCESSFULLY

In order to understand how to structure a paper, it is crucial to know the purpose of writing it, especially when it comes to one-page business plan. There is no basic template, which can help you outline the work properly when you do not know the reason for writing it. Therefore, it is important to decide beforehand. Usually, one-page plans are being written for investors. They are extremely busy people, who are short on time, so when your presentation is brief and exact, it is a win for everybody. The main thing you have to focus on in such case is a significance of your brand and the income. Investors want to know that they will profit from your project, and the money is not wasted vainly. Therefore, the financials have to be clear and realistic, and your credibility will be unquestionable. One page business plan for nonprofits is one of the hardest to write. Nonprofit companies do not have any revenue, as they serve the higher purposes, such us helping bereaved or sick people, animals, kids, orphans, or protecting someone's rights, etc. However, they still need donors to fund their mission. It is important for such projects to be or get recognizable and likable in media and among the masses. Therefore, attention needs to be focused on a number of people who will receive help, the reliability, and dedication of the team. Some one-page plans are being written for sales. They may either predict future sales or be a strategy for their increase. The main things to be included are market analysis, customers' overview, competitive advantages, and financials. The plan has to aim for actual results and overview the milestones. Many entrepreneurs write one-page project plans for themselves. This is a smart move, as it helps to get a big image of the project and analyze it faster. It is the situation when it is up to the entrepreneur how to structure the paper and what to include.

WHAT IS A FEASIBILITY OF BUSINESS PLAN?

A feasibility analysis of a business plan is a work that analyzes whether a specific project is implementable. All of the big and successful companies conduct a feasibility study before getting to real actions to ensure that their idea will be profitable. If you are a greenie and just getting started with your business, it is crucial to check if your plan is viable to understand if it is worth investing into. There is a huge difference between a feasibility study and a business plan. While the first one tells you if your business will work, the second one describes the way it will function. A BP may include some or all of the sections of a study to support the claims with real data. The structure of the report on practicability depends on the project you have in mind. There are thousands of examples on the web, so if you are not sure which one to use, here is a general outline sample: Product/Service - provides a precise description of a product or a service a company will sell. Recommendations - show final findings and give appropriate recommendations regarding feasibility. This example does not cover some of the major details, as they are individual for each idea. However, it gives a basic understanding of the way the work needs to be organized. You can look up a more specific template or ask our support team to send you a few that will fit your plan. Also, you may come up with a more original outline with the help of our professional writers. Simply ask our specialists to outline or “do my business plan for me” and let our experts conduct research and make your feasibility study accurate and organic.

HOW TO WRITE AN EFFICIENT BUSINESS PLAN FEASIBILITY REPORT?

Either you are a young entrepreneur or an experienced businessperson trying to enter a new market, the first thing you need to do before taking a certain project seriously is writing a feasibility report. You may have a fantastic idea, an outstanding product, and even millions of potential customers but it will not prevent you from a failure in a first few month if you do not think every detail through. The only thing that will show you real pitfalls and help your company stay afloat when you start it is a feasibility analysis. Therefore, you have to think of the parts that deserve your attention and may affect the project implementation the most. First and the most important thing that has to be researched is a market condition. The number of your competitors will not matter if you see that the market is on a decline, as there is no way for a young firm to survive there. Think about the nearest future: there will be no demand for your service at the market in a few years, or the market itself will be moved aback by new technologies. If the forecast is positive, the niche has to be large enough to fit your organization and let you get a decent revenue. Your product has to be unique, or have sufficient differences from others to make you competitive enough to stand against big corporations in the area. Hence, you have to research what your competitors sell to find the ways to make your company more attractive to the clients and build a few strategies to improve and develop your project. There are a few other things worth focusing on while writing a feasibility report for business plan. It is crucial to think of technological and financial risks you are taking, and, if you will have no other choice, the ways you can quit the business without losing too much. You need to calculate whether you can afford the project and implement it on time. Also, it is vital to understand the way you will work with clients step by step from them ordering and up to you shipping the product, and what kind of resources this process will require. You can find a lot more criteria for the analysis that will suit your idea, as the ones above will only show you a broad picture and will hardly give a precise final answer. Whenever you come up with a new project, do not forget to conduct a feasibility study for business plan before getting to the implementation. After you realize what it really takes to bring the idea to life and run a company, it will become clear if it is worth it and if you are able to manage your own firm. A thorough analysis of such amount of aspects is a very troublesome process. It may take months to finish, and there is no guarantee that the results you get will be correct. Hence, there is no wonder you may have an idea to “pay someone to write my business plan”, or at least the most complex parts of it. Sometimes, it is better to leave the hard and time-consuming work to professionals to be able to concentrate on other important things. Pro-Papers is exactly what you need in this case. We are a team of experts, who have completed hundreds of feasibility studies to prevent people with great projects from a huge failure during implementation.

WHAT IS AN OPERATIONAL BUSINESS PLAN?

An operations business plan is a document that describes processes a company uses to satisfy clients’ needs. It may be a section of a BP or a separate piece if it covers numerous points and explains them in details. All of the operations project plans include two key sections: a daily operations plan, which describes what has to be performed to serve customers every day, and a list of milestones, which defines goals that have to be achieved within a certain period of time. It is obvious that such work has a complicated structure, which depends on the product or a service a company will deliver. Therefore, an outline sample will be different for each idea, but there are some parts that have to be presented in every plan: Location – describes and analyzes the place a company will be located at. Equipment – shows the inventory you will need and the ways you are going to manage it. Supplies – tell how and where you will get the materials you need and discusses the reliability of vendors. Logistics – present the ways you are going to move or deliver products, materials, equipment, services, and other things necessary for your project. Production – describes the process of making a product or rendering a service. Sales – demonstrates how you are going to sell the product/service and make cash. Organization – shows the hierarchy of your personnel and describes main functions. Policies – present rules a company and clients have to follow to make cooperation pleasant and productive. Objectives – define milestones and dates when a company will reach certain levels of performance. These sections should not necessarily be placed in the same order as shown in the example of the structure. Some operations plans include a lot more points, but these are the basic ones, which will help you start analyzing the implementation process. If you need a more specific outline, you can search for a template that will be more suitable for your idea. However, if the concept you have is unique, you might “need someone to write my business plan” as outlining and presenting your original project might be a rather complex task. Experts from Pro-Papers will gladly help your brainchild to make it to the real plan. Purchase a business plan on the operations from us and let specialists take care of the paperwork for you.

You may have an innovative and superior idea, but the ugly truth is that the world cannot care less. People are busy living their own lives and running their own companies, and an idea is hardly something that can make their worlds stop spinning. However, a nice project or a great plan is. Why is there a difference? Imagine a person, who has a Ph.D. in literature, and who you barely know, told you he wants to build a spaceship. You would think he is out of his mind and has no real goals in life. But what if that person came up to you with a blueprint and precise calculations made by professional physicists and mathematicians saying that he only needs materials and knows where to find them? You would definitely become interested. For potential partners, investors, and other people in the niche, your idea may sound as crazy as a spaceship building. However, if you show that you know exactly how to implement it and make it work in practice, they will start taking it seriously and can even help you execute it. Hence, if you have a well-defined idea, the only thing that can make it real is a good business plan. People with amazing ideas have always been the ones who made a change. However, a modern world has its own requirements, and nowadays, having an idea is not enough. It is important to be strong, competitive and know how to make your plans work. Also, it is vital to have your every action written on paper.
