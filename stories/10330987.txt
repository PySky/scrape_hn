Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.

The Pillow Team is excited to announce the release of Pillow 3.0.0. While “3 is just a number after 2”, there are some significant changes in this release all users should be aware of:

I’m particularly happy to see libjpeg & zlib required; this will avoid many-a-broken-installation in the future. PIL is of little practical value when installed without JPEG support, yet this has been the default for over 20 years. No more! Thanks to wiredfool for spearheading this change.

For more goodness, please see the release notes & changelog:

Thanks to all the developers & users of PIL & Pillow. Enjoy the 3.0.0 release, and as always report’em if you got’em and we’ll fix’em.|||
