Google Inc. has invested in a new round of funding for Symphony Communication Services LLC that values the Wall Street-backed messaging company at about $650 million, people familiar with the matter said.

Google’s GOOG, +0.17%  support adds a technology-industry stalwart to the list of banks and investment firms--such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and BlackRock Inc.--that have backed Symphony and its fledgling communications software. Symphony’s latest funding round is expected to close this week, the people said.

Representatives for Google and Symphony declined to comment.

Symphony was created as an alternative to Bloomberg LP’s terminals, which have long been a hallmark of trading floors but are viewed as a major cost center for financial firms.

The startup platform initially made its encryption technology a selling point, but attracted regulatory attention from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which was concerned about record-keeping. The agency, New York’s top banking watchdog, reached a deal last month with the four banks it regulates that invested in Symphony over how to keep their records.
