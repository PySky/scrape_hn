A few weeks back I had written about why oil looked ready for a bounce and that rig count in USA had been falling at the highest rate on record.

Since that post, oil has risen over 10% and as of this writing the trend only seems to be getting stronger. Ofocurse this may all be temporary but the key thing to note is that the rationale for the trade must be based on data as available now.

The impact of falling rig count is also evident in the  declining production of oil in US as is evident from the chart below (EIA.gov)

While the optimists among you may argue that the decline may be temporary and production may rise again, there are several factors to consider:

I am targeting oil back at around 60 in the next few months (6-12) and am building long positions in OIL and XES. However, the key is to do it very slowly every few weeks and not go all in at once.

Aside from oil, chinese H share seem to be getting out of their downtrodden status and as mentioned in my previous post, I continue to hold long position in XPP.

Lastly, mining and gold mining stocks seem to be bottoming out.  I continue to hold and increase my long positions at regular intervals in  PICK and GDX as mentioned in an earlier post.|||

Prepare for a new oil shock!
