In the United States, transportation alone accounts for nearly 30 percent of global warming emissions. Cars and trucks, specifically, account for almost one-fifth of the total U.S. emissions, contributing around 24 pounds of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for every gallon of gas.

Any serious effort to decrease global warming emissions and fight climate change, therefore, includes developing cleaner vehicles. One of the champions in this front is Tesla and its electric vehicle lineup. Now, Elon Musk’s innovative company is making their cheapest EV even cheaper.

Yesterday, Tesla announced a $5,000 decrease in the price of the Model S 75 and its all-wheel drive 75D variant — both powered by a 75kWh battery — putting their base prices at $69,500 and $74,500, respectively. At the same time, the drop in prices was accompanied by added freebies. Both Model S variants now have an automatic rear liftgate and a glass roof.

Other Tesla EV models also got some price adjustments, and the cost of upgrading to higher battery capacities dropped as well. The price changes come as the $35,000 Model 3 is expected to begin shipping this year.

Making EVs accessible to more people is a big part of Tesla’s fight against climate change. Putting more electric cars on the roads will surely cut CO2 emissions in the long run, and once regulations catch up with autonomous driving tech, Teslas will be saving the lives of both current drivers and future generations.|||
