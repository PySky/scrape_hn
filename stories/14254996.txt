To make my Lisp a more useful language, and to pave the road for a module system and package manager, I added the capability of performing IO.

I like the names and for this functionality, and I think using slurp as a unified interface for network and file IO is an elegant idea. Let’s see them in action:

Slurp uses the uri package to check if the given location is a network resource. If it is, it uses wreq to make a get request, extracting the response body and turning it into a string. Otherwise, it reads the file at the given location. The result is turned into a Lisp string either way.

In case you’re wondering, the operator comes from the lens package, and is defined as .

Finally, the functions are wrapped in a LispVal constructor, and defined in the enviroment.|||
