Over the last 2 years, we’ve built Framer into an extensive product, one that’s supportive of, to quote ourselves, “design without limits”. But with such a robust toolkit comes some degree of clutter. Today we’re shipping a redesign of the Framer interface, one that aims to promote a more symbiotic flow between code and canvas. Rather than adding to an already crowded toolbar, we’ve made sure to keep this revamp smart and simple. Spring cleaning never looked this good.

For any beginner, Framer is best understood as a series of building blocks. You start by drawing a layer, then you add a state or animation, followed by an event, usually a tap or click. These four core concepts are simple for anyone to grasp and were designed to help get you up and running fast. These foundational blocks were always available through easy Auto-Code functions. However, because we had them nested under the insert menu in a busy toolbar, users were not intuitively discovering this easy flow. To stimulate a better onboarding process, we’ve moved these core Framer building blocks top left, into a clean sidebar dropdown for easy insertion. Now all your most important one-click functions are integrated directly into the editor.

Importing from Sketch, Docs and Error Inspecting have also moved to the bottom left of the side toolbar. Though they’re key contributors to your prototyping flow, you won’t need them as frequently as your main building blocks. Inspect now sits conveniently next to the error message display, making for an easy way to debug your prototype.|||
