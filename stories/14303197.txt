Neil Harbisson (GB), Cyborg and contemporary artist

Topic Leader: Stephen Sackur (GB), Presenter HARDtalk, BBC News



Living with an antenna mounted to your skull might seem absurd for most of us. Neal Harbisson has been doing so since 2004, and is often called the world's first cyborg. He fights for the rights of cyborgs and the freedom of every human to design his/her body. His work raises the question: Should we continue to adapt our planet to us, or should we as humans adapt to it? This is just one of the core questions he will be discussing with Stephen Sackur during the One-on-One ses-sion at the St. Gallen Symposium.
