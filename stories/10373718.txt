Farm Civilization wants to change the way how we grow food. We believe that with todays technologies, everyone can be a farmer. Crowdfunded farming operated from your mobile device can feed the planet.

We have not much available fresh food today closer enough to our towns and cities. We use more fuel on our transport, producing CO2 emissions and using valuable energy for storing the food. This is very cost ineffective way. We are not able to deliver fresh food fast enough to the wide costumers. Besides that, one in every nine people on our planet go to bed hungry each night. Our rivers are polluted and we are using chemicals to grow our food as a fertilizers.|||
