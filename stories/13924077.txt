One of Steve Jobs more famous quotes is “Focus is saying no to thousands of good ideas”. I find this to be true most of the time. If your goal is to build a product or finish a specific task it’s important to focus on what needs to be done. I believe it’s natural for the brain to find patterns and connections while solving a problem, and sometimes these patterns and connections can lend themselves to attractive ideas. Of course, If you go down every single path that makes itself available to you, you’ll never get where you want to go.

However, when it comes to side projects I believe it’s worth losing focus from time to time. The point of a side project, at least for me is to explore what I find interesting, try new things and expand my knowledge beyond what I do at work. So if a completely separate idea is derived from a side project, if it’s interesting, I jump in.

Case in point, I’ve been learning Swift on the side and been itching to use my new found knowledge on an app. After a few hours of research, I decided to build a game using Apple’s SpriteKit and Swift. I had figured out the high-level design and the game mechanics. I couldn’t wait to get started.

The game was going to be a word search game, where the grid would expand as the words are found. I thought it was a rather clever mechanism that would make the game more fun and dynamic.|||

How I got sidetracked while building a game and ended up with a web dictionary and why it was totally worth it!
