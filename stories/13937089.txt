The study and practice show that the operation wave on extra high voltage equipment insulation effect is special. The distribution of operating wave on insulation is different from lightning wave and power frequency voltage. Therefore ,we can not use equivalent power frequency voltage instead of internal over voltage. The operating impulse voltage should be used to test the insulation resistance. The use of impulse voltage generator generate a standard impulse voltage wave and voltage value,which can be used to test insulation of extra high voltage equipment under lighting over voltage or operating voltage. It is operating impulse withstand voltage test.

Question 2: what’s the time of our current standard lighting impulse wave front? Operating impulse voltage wave tail?

Our current standard voltage shock wave front time is 1.2 us, 30% tolerance. Operating impulse voltage wave tail time is 50us, 20% tolerance.

Question 3: How much voltage should we choose for lighting impulse test and operating impulse test of experiment of 10 kv equipment?

Acording to national standard ,we don’t need to do operating impulse test.

Question 4: What’s the properties of long air gap breakdown under operating impulse voltage?

Lightning and operating over-voltage waveform of impulse voltage wave discharge delay and volt-second properties.

The answer is not. According to the GB and IEC, usually only voltage level greater than or equal to 245 kv high-voltage electric need to do the impact test operation, but there is a steep wave test for domestic insulator.|||
