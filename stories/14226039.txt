A hacking group calling itself TheDarkOverlord is threatening to leak a trove of unreleased TV shows and movies. The group has already backed up its warning by uploading the season five premiere of Netflix's Orange is The New Black. The group says it obtained the content from a post-production studio and after the company failed to pay a ransom, spilled it onto torrent sites.
