YInMn was actually created by accident in 2009 by chemist Mas Subramanian and his team at Oregon State University who were exploring how to improve computer hard drives. (Before this, French chemist Louis Jacques Thenard found the last blue pigment, cobalt blue, in 1802).

Subramanian made his discovery while heating up materials and chemicals to temperatures of over 1000°C in a furnace, and was shocked when he found the vivid blue powder.

YInMn isn’t just a special colour either: it absorbs UV light and can resist extremely high temperatures.

It first hit the headlines last year, when it went on sale for the first time mixed into coatings, plastics and paint. And you can now play your part in science history as Crayola is bringing the colour into the mainstream.|||
