TIPA is the acronym for the Technical Image Press Association and is made up of publishers from a total of 27 magazines and photography media around the world.

Each year, they choose different products to reward them for being the best in their category. This time, LG UltraFine 5K monitor has been awarded the Best Monitor of the Year award for photo editing.

According to the TIPA editors, the LG monitor offers a professional way of displaying photos and videos just like in real life.

Thanks to resolution 5K, Thunderbolt 3 connection and support for DCI-P3 this monitor has been made with the award. TIPA says:

When Apple introduced the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in 2016 ensured that there is no better monitor to use with a Mac than the LG UltraFine 5K.

However, like other products, it has suffered different problems since its launch. The first one was the lack of stock.

But perhaps the most serious came when the LG UltraFine 5K monitor experienced problems due to interference with the router and wireless signals.

For this LG removed them from the market and offered a new version where they isolated the screen better so that these interferences were not given.

You can currently buy the LG UltraFine 5K monitor from the Apple Store directly, being perhaps the ideal monitor to accompany a Mac Pro, an iMac or a MacBook. Its price starts at 1,399 euros.|||
