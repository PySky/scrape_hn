An engineer and artist has adapted the Microsoft AI personal assistant Cortana to resemble the hologram sidekick from Halo with the same name. The project is quite extensive, using a custom-designed mirrored glass pyramid to project the hologram. The creator even enlisted his wife to help him motion capture the movements of the assistant.

The program can respond to the same cues that Cortana uses on Microsoft devices. When asked whether an umbrella will be needed for the day, Cortana responds, "That probably won't be necessary," and the animated figure pulls up an image of the weather report. This definitely feels like sci-fi technology fit for Master Chief, but it's hard to say how practical a personal assistant like this really is.

It's the future, finally!
