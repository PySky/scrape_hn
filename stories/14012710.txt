The Typescrit implementation for GraphQL, a query language for APIs created by Facebook. See specification here http://graphql.org/

That package is currently in development and not ready for PRODUCTION. Graphql.ts use decorator and metadata for generate a graphql.js model. The why of this package is to provide a suger syntax for Typescript and use the power of the typings. Feel free to contribute, any issues, pull request or stars are welcome.

We use reflect-metadata for have type at the runtime, so we need to pass some parameters to the compilator

GraphQL.ts provides the capabilities to build the schema. This schema will be interprated by GraphQL.js

First, build a GraphQL type schema which maps to your code base.

This code will generate at the runtime the equivalent model

Then, serve the result of a query against that schema.

Graphql-ts work with decorator for annotate the code and then generate the model
