Squeak ran in 2.8 MB with a current IDE at about 1.6 MB. Minix might have code that uses the MMU (can theoretically be done at compile time) and it still uses synchronization queues but its size is merit enough. 100 million SLOC is not all inlining folks. Optimization tricks by those like Jochen Liedtke make performance issues minimal. Furthermore, performance can be improved with HARDWARE SUPPORT! Imagine that... (See Application Specific Real-Time Microkernel in Hardware by Susanna Nordstr√∂m). Imagine even some assembly optimization like with the (GUI OS + applications) MenuetOS/KolibriOS that FITS ON A 1.44MB FLOPPY! Get that? Q: You have wrote the whole OS in a x86 assembly. How much speed you think you gained by using asm-only when compared writting the source in C or C++? Ville Turjanmaa: Parts of Linux was rewritten in assembly and the speed gain was 10-40%. That will give an idea.|||
