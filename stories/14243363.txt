Project-specific REPLs for Node.js. allows you to automatically import modules and values into your REPL sessions with simple configuration in your project's and/or .

Add the following to .

This will start a REPL session with already imported.

You can pass an array of objects containing the keys (required), (for imports), or (for values).

Local modules can be imported, too.

In addition to configuration in "package.json", you may optionally define your configuration in a file. This is useful if you want to dynamically compute modules and values for your REPLs..

Note: Configuration defined in takes precedence over configuration defined in .

Context can be defined as an object rather than an array.

Context values that are promises will be resolved before the REPL starts.

You can also define as a function in . The function will receive the REPL context and the parsed object.

You can also define as a function in . The function will receive the REPL context and the parsed object.

can be used programatically. The function takes the same options as Node's built-in and returns a that resolves to a instance.
