In addition to those two textbooks, my UF course includes select chapters from some of my other favourite books on data visualization:

The Functional Art by Alberto Cairo (Chapters 1 and 3) The Truthful Art by Alberto Cairo (Chapter 2), and As you'll see below, I also included several chapters from the ebook DataÂ + Design Below are links to the rest of my course readings, as well as videos that I recommend my students watch in addition to my lectures. Just to provide a bit of structure to the list, I've broken it down by topic week. Those topics primarily reflect the content of my recorded lectures, which aren't public, so sometimes the readings will match the topic and sometimes they won't.

Also, full disclosure: I've included a couple of my own pieces in the list below. This is mainly because they covered key topics I wanted to include in the course and having them in the readings saved me from needing to address them in my lectures.

Finally, if you've come across a great reading or video on data visualization or Tableau that's not listed here, please add it to the comments so others can find it. And if you've got a data visualization reading list of your own, please provide the link.

So, without further ado, here's the list:|||
