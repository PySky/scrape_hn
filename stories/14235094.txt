Haskell is unlike any other programming language. It's purely functional with a strong type system and lazy evaluation. In practical terms, this means that Haskell treats programs a lot like math, so you have to think more than you type. Along with being arguably the most interesting language, Haskell has the reputation of being one of the most challenging programming languages to learn. Learning Haskell doesn't have to be difficult, and this book can help!

Learn Haskell teaches you the Haskell language and functional programming concepts while you hack on interesting problems that you'll find challenging but never frustrating. This example-filled tutorial will take you from beginning concepts to tackling the tough topics, like Monads, easing you along the way with increasingly sophisticated examples. You'll find lots of crystal-clear illustrations, hands-on exercises that reinforce the concepts, and open-ended tasks that encourage you to hack and explore Haskell on your own. By the time you're done, you'll be able to use Haskell as a platform for having fun with code and possess a deep understanding of functional programming.|||
