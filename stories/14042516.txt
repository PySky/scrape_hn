Ar•chi•tect (n): a person professionally engaged in the design of certain large constructions; the deviser, maker, or creator of anything.

I started this post with the definition of an architect to show you that everyone is an architect in their own way, whether we realize it or not. As an entrepreneur, you should undoubtedly bring this approach to your businesses and side projects.

And if you’re just starting out, this is crucial to your ability to build a thriving audience.

Architects are responsible for nearly everything we use and come in contact with on the daily basis. Much of what they build helps us and makes our lives easier.

They create the buildings we work and live in. They design stadiums for our enjoyment. They build the roads, highways and bridges we use to get where we need to go.

Their work directly impacts the lives of others in a positive way.

Architects are geniuses in their own right. They are individuals with a distinct, unique, and often times futuristic way of viewing things.

Architects add the aesthetic to our lives. They add shape and structure. They add form and function to our environment.

Every creative, business owner, entrepreneur, or curator of any kind has the opportunity to do the same thing for the audience they service.

If you want to build a thriving audience, your mindset should be focused on creating value-based connections and experiences. Find a way to show the relationship between your business, brand or content and something of value to them. Build a bridge between who they are and who they want to be.

This “bridge” is where the true value lies.

It’s your responsibility to create bridges between your offerings and their world. The benefit of figuring out how to move people back and forth across those bridges is trust, and ultimately, more business.

Are you thinking and acting like an architect? Are you creating bridges between your business and your audience? How do you build bridges?|||
