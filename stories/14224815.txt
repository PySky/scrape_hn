This is a map of the top 10,000 subreddits on reddit. Hovering over points will display the name of the subreddits they represent. Please be aware that you may find subreddit names objectionable; avoid mousing over the large upper clusters if you wish to avoid most of the objectionably named subreddits.

Use the mouse wheel or box zoom tool (from the upper left of the plot) to zoom in, and drag to pan.

You can enter the name of a subreddit, or a cluster number, in the apporpriate box to have it highlighted on the map. To clear such highlighting just enter an empty name or number and press enter.

The interactive plot is provided by bokeh, and was built in Python using a number of libraries including, but not limited to, pandas, scikit-learn, LargeVis, and hdbscan. Many thanks go to the authors of those projects.

An example notebook of an analysis of subreddits based on the same techniques used here is available here. Code and documentation to generate this plot, and to perform similar analyses is available on github.|||
