Technology is changing — shifting towards a world where low cost, connected chips power products used by billions of people around the world. Everything from jet turbines and oil rigs, to cars, cameras, and clothing are coming online. And while these tiny chips unlock incredible potential, they are a liability if not secure.

When PC vulnerabilities are discovered, software vendors issue a patch, which end users are required to download and install. These patches keep PC software up-to-date and secure. IoT devices also require patches, but the PC security model can’t scale to 22 billion devices; IoT manufacturers often haven’t built over-the-air (OTA) update mechanisms and are terrified that updates will brick a user’s device. In the meantime, consumers never think about having to upgrade their internet-connected “toaster.”

Cloudflare Orbit solves this problem at the network level by creating a secure and authenticated connection between an IoT device and its origin server. Orbit takes the Internet out of IoT: Behind Orbit, devices are I*oT.

Orbit allows device manufacturers to instantly deploy “virtual patches” and block vulnerabilities across all devices on the network simultaneously. This keeps malicious requests from reaching devices, buys time for IoT manufacturers to carefully QA their updates, and keeps devices from leaking data or launching DDoS attacks.|||
