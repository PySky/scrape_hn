This page summarizes the changes between official stable releases of Go. The change log has the full details.

To update to a specific release, use:

Each major Go release obsoletes and ends support for the previous one. For example, if Go 1.5 has been released, then it is the current release and Go 1.4 and earlier are no longer supported. We fix critical problems in the current release as needed by issuing minor revisions (for example, Go 1.5.1, Go 1.5.2, and so on).

As a special case, we issue minor revisions for critical security problems in both the current release and the previous release. For example, if Go 1.5 is the current release then we will issue minor revisions to fix critical security problems in both Go 1.4 and Go 1.5 as they arise. See the security policy for more details.
