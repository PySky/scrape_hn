I continue to be impressed with how rich this subject is, and my understanding of \( \pi \) and \( \tau \) continues to evolve. On Half Tau Day, 2012, I believed I identified exactly what is wrong with \( \pi \). My argument hinged on an analysis of the surface area and volume of an \( n \)-dimensional sphere, which (as shown below) makes clear that \( \pi \) doesn’t have any fundamental geometric significance. My analysis was incomplete, though—a fact brought to my attention in a remarkable message from Tau Manifesto reader Jeff Cornell. As a result, this section is an attempt not only to definitively debunk \( \pi \), but also to articulate the truth about \( \tau \), a truth that is deeper and subtler than I had imagined.

Note: This section is more advanced than the rest of the manifesto and can be skipped without loss of continuity. If you find it confusing, I recommend proceeding directly to the conclusion in Section 6.

We start our investigations with the generalization of a circle to arbitrary dimensions. This object, called a hypersphere or an \( n \)-sphere, can be defined as follows. (For convenience, we assume that these spheres are centered on the origin.) A \( 0 \)-sphere is the empty set, and we define its “interior” to be a point. A \( 1 \)-sphere is the set of all points satisfying

which consists of the two points \( \pm r \). Its interior, which satisfies

is the line segment from \( -r \) to \( r \). A \( 2 \)-sphere is a circle, which is the set of all points satisfying

and its interior is a ball. The generalization to arbitrary \( n \), although difficult to visualize for \( n > 3 \), is straightforward: an \( n \)-sphere is the set of all points satisfying

The Pi Manifesto (discussed in Section 4.2) includes a formula for the volume of a unit \( n \)-sphere as an argument in favor of \( \pi \):

where (as noted in Section 4.2) the Gamma function is

This is a special case of the formula for general radius, which is also typically written in terms of \( \pi \):

Because \( V_n = \int S_n\,dr \), we have \( S_n = dV_n/dr \), which means that the surface area can be written as follows:

Rather than simply take these formulas at face value, let’s see if we can untangle them to shed more light on the question of \( \pi \) vs. \( \tau \). We begin our analysis by noting that the apparent simplicity of the above formulas is an illusion: although the Gamma function is notationally simple, in fact it is an integral over a semi-infinite domain, which is not a simple idea at all. Fortunately, the Gamma function can be simplified in certain special cases. For example, when \( n \) is an integer, it is easy to show (using integration by parts) that

Seen this way, \( \Gamma \) can be interpreted as a generalization of the factorial function to real-valued arguments.

In the \( n \)-dimensional surface area and volume formulas, the argument of \( \Gamma \) is not necessarily an integer, but rather is (\( 1 + \frac{n}{2} \)), which is an integer when \( n \) is even and is a half-integer when \( n \) is odd. Taking this into account gives the following expression, which is taken from a standard reference, Wolfram MathWorld, and as usual is written in terms of \( \pi \):

\[ S_n = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{2\pi^{n/2}\,r^{n-1}}{(\frac{1}{2}n - 1)!} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \displaystyle \frac{2^{(n+1)/2}\pi^{(n-1)/2}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

Integrating with respect to \( r \) then gives

\[ V_n = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{\pi^{n/2}\,r^n}{(\frac{n}{2})!} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \displaystyle \frac{2^{(n+1)/2}\pi^{(n-1)/2}\,r^n}{n!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

Let’s examine the volume formula in more detail. Notice first that MathWorld uses the double factorial function \( n!! \)—but, strangely, it uses it only in the odd case. (This is a hint of things to come.) The double factorial function, although rarely encountered in mathematics, is elementary: it’s like the normal factorial function, but involves subtracting \( 2 \) at a time instead of \( 1 \), so that, e.g., \( 5!! = 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \) and \( 6!! = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \). In general, we have

\[ n!! = \begin{cases} n(n-2)(n-4)\ldots6\cdot4\cdot2 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ n(n-2)(n-4)\ldots5\cdot3\cdot1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

(By definition, \( 0!! = 1!! = 1 \).) Note that this definition naturally divides into even and odd cases, making MathWorld’s decision to use it only in the odd case still more mysterious.

To solve this mystery, we’ll start by taking a closer look at the formula for odd \( n \):

we notice that it can be rewritten as

and here we recognize our old friend \( 2\pi \).

Now let’s look at the even case. We noted above how strange it is to use the ordinary factorial in the even case but the double factorial in the odd case. Indeed, because the double factorial is already defined piecewise, if we unified the formulas by using \( n!! \) in both cases we could pull it out as a common factor:

\[ V_n = \frac{1}{n!!}\times \begin{cases} \ldots & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \ldots & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

So, is there any connection between the factorial and the double factorial? Yes—when \( n \) is even, the two are related by the following identity:

(This is easy to verify using mathematical induction.) Substituting this into the volume formula for even \( n \) then yields

and again we find a factor of \( 2\pi \).

Putting these results together, we see that the volume of an \( n \)-sphere can be rewritten as

\[ V_n = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}\,r^n}{n!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \displaystyle \frac{2(2\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\,r^n}{n!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases} \]

and its surface area is

\[ S_n = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \displaystyle \frac{2(2\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd.} \end{cases} \]

\[ S_n = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{\tau^{n/2}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \displaystyle \frac{2\tau^{(n-1)/2}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd.} \end{cases} \]

To unify the formulas further, we can use the floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \), which is simply the largest integer less than or equal to \( x \) (so that, e.g., \( \lfloor 3.7 \rfloor = \lfloor 3.2 \rfloor = 3 \)). This gives

\[ S_n = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{\tau^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ \displaystyle \frac{2\tau^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \end{cases} \]

which allows us to write the formula as follows:

\[ S_n = \frac{\tau^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\,r^{n-1}}{(n-2)!!}\times \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ 2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

Integrating with respect to \( r \) then yields

\[ V_n = \frac{\tau^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\,r^n}{n!!}\times \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ 2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

The equations above are a major improvement over the original formulation in terms of \( \pi \), making what seems like an unassailable argument for \( \tau \). As we’ll see, it is indeed the case that \( \pi \) is virtually useless in this context, but things are not as simple as they seem. In particular, Tau Manifesto reader Jeff Cornell pointed out, to my utter astonishment, that the formulas can be simplified further using the measure of a right angle, which he called \( \lambda \) (lambda):

The biggest advantage of \( \lambda \) is that it completely unifies the even and odd cases. Making the substitution \( \tau = 4\lambda \) gives

\[ \tau^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} = (4\lambda)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} = 2^{2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} \lambda^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} = \lambda^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\times \begin{cases} 2^n & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ 2^{n-1} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \]

This means that we have a factor of

\[ \lambda^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} \times \begin{cases} 2^n & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ 2^{n-1} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} \times \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\ 2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases} = 2^n\,\lambda^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}, \]

which eliminates the explicit dependence on parity. Applying this to the formulas for surface area and volume yields

The simplification in these formulas appears to come at the cost of a factor of \( 2^n \), but even this has a clear geometric meaning: a sphere in \( n \) dimensions divides naturally into \( 2^n \) congruent pieces, corresponding to the \( 2^n \) families of solutions to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = r^2 \) (one for each choice of \( \pm x_i \)). In two dimensions, these are the circular arcs in each of the four quadrants; in three dimensions, they are the sectors of the sphere in each octant; and so on in higher dimensions.

What the formulas in terms of \( \lambda \) tell us is that we can exploit the symmetry of the sphere by calculating the surface area or volume of one piece—typically the principal part where \( x_i > 0 \) for every \( i \)—and then find the full value by multiplying by \( 2^n \). This suggests that the fundamental constant uniting the geometry of \( n \)-spheres is the measure of a right angle. (I liken the difference between \( \tau \) and \( \lambda \) to the difference between the electron charge \( e \) and the charge on a down quark \( q_d = e/3 \): the latter is the true quantum of charge, but using \( q_d \) in place of \( e \) would introduce inconvenient factors of \( 3 \) throughout physics and chemistry.)|||

The Tau Manifesto is dedicated to one of the most important numbers in mathematics, perhaps the most important: the circle constant relating the circumference of a circle to its linear dimension. For millennia, the circle has been considered the most perfect of shapes, and the circle constant captures the geometry of the circle in a single number.
