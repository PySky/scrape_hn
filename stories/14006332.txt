why not Rewrite It In Rust (RIIR)

Are you an author or contributor to a software project?

Have you ever been asked to rewrite, or consider rewriting that project in Rust?

If so, you may have been a victim of the RIIR agenda that is sweeping the web.

If this has happened to you, please report it so that something can be done.

No. This is a joke.

I don't, actually. I believe that those who spend their time asking people to rewrite their projects are probably not themselves active Rust developers, as those active devs are probably busy writing memory-safe code.|||
