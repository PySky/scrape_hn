This is an expandable Android fingerprint API compatible lib, which also combines Samsung and MeiZu's official Fingerprint API.

Samsung and MeiZu's fingerprint SDK supports most devices which system versions less than Android 6.0.

Please clone repo and look on the example project to get more details

If you make five wrong fingerprint attempts, Android Fingerprint API requires some time to continue work on the sensor.

In that case locked out, so it would be good to make the user aware that sensor is temporarily unavailable (near 30 seconds).

If this project help you reduce time to develop, you can give me a cup of coffee :)|||
