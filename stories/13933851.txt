Following IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1 released earlier today, a fresh EAP build for Gogland EAP 7 becomes available, bringing you more bugfixes and new features.

First of all, Debugger improvements.

Run to cursor action that resumes code execution and stops at a given line is now available both via shortcut and from the menu.

Breakpoints now support Conditional expressions that let you define conditions under which they will be hit:

Data representation inside Variables, Watches, Evaluate Expression, Inspect and inline information is improved: it displays nested objects, supports arrays, etc.

Also, the update brings several new intention actions, that let you add an alias for an import statement and replaces all usages accordingly:

And to invoke go generate for a generated comment at the caret:

The “err” live template has been improved and now it is aware of the error variables within the scope:

In Settings | Editor | General | Code Folding the IDE offers two new options (off by default): One line returns and One line panics. These options fold single-line if statements with return and panic statements inside to a more compact syntax:

We’ve merged changes from IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1 that include all the platform improvements and new features, the most notable of which is the reworked Find in Path dialog, that now provides instant preview of the sought text and lets you jump to any result with Enter:

Another area of the platform improvements is JavaScript support, and it includes dozens of changes:

And, of course, many small, but important Go improvements:

Last, but not least, we’re happy to announce the availability of the Go plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and other paid IDEs which provides the functionality equal to Gogland.  Read the FAQ to see how it differs from the third-party plugin.

Note that there’s no patch update available due to the migration to IntelliJ Platform 2017.1.

That’s it for today. Feel free to give the new EAP build a try right away and share your feedback with us through the comments as well as the issue tracker.|||
