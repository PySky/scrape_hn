Then is there any way out to use VLC play these unsupported videos? Sure! Or you want to convert VLC file to any formats for better playing on devices? Read on and I’ll share one VLC assistant for you respectively.

According to some forums, we found many users have problems playing videos like MP4, MKV etc on VLC player. For example, when opening MP4 media contents to VLC, we will experience problems like: VLC stuttering, VLC skipping or freezing when playing 1080P HD MP4; VLC choppy playback with 4K MP4 files or VLC MP4 grey screen; VLC just loads certain MP4 forever…; When playing MKV on VLC , you may encounter “no audio in VLC player” etc. And some other videos sometimes also can’t be played on VLC player well. In these cases, you’d better get a video converter for VLC and convert videos to VLC supported video for smooth playback.
