After years of perfecting my Sublime Text setup, I’ve decided to give Atom a chance. It took a couple of months, and I’m very proud of the setup I got. I feel super productive.

I divided this list into Utilities and JS/React specific packages. Default keybindings are also mentioned.

Beautify HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Coldfusion, SQL, and more in Atom. ⌃+⌥+B

Format your JavaScript using Prettier. Comes with powerful optional ESlint integration. (Recommended by Dan Abramov — Thanks!). ⌃+⌥+F

Atom’s alt+t (transpose) is more like a string flip. Sublime’s would switch two selected strings one with another, which is a much more useful behavior. ⌥+T

With this package you can replace given string with another, but preserve its original case. ⌘+⌃+R

A quick way to change the case of the current selection. From to etc. ⌘+K ⌘+C/S

Duplicates the selection if there is one, otherwise, duplicates the line. Same behavior of Sublime Text. Atom duplicates whole line. ⌘+⇧+D

vim-fugitive like package for atom. make commits and other git things without the terminal

Double click on a word to highlight it throughout the open file.

Package for maintaining local history of files (history of your changes to the code files).

Get easy access to all your projects and manage them with project specific settings and options. ⌘+⌃+P

Related provides a quick way to access files that are “related” to the file currently opened. For example, switching between  and  files. ⌘+⇧+R

Creates easy Command Palette entries for setting the syntax of the current file. Similar to Sublime’s. ⌘+⇧+P

alt+click across lines to select a block of text with carets on each line. ⌥+Drag

Plugin replaces tab’s title if opened index.* file for more readability.

Synchronize settings, keymaps, user styles, init script, snippets and installed packages across Atom instances. I back up all my settings to Gist and sync between work/personal computers.

Toggle a single-quoted string to a double-quoted string (and ticks ` in JS!) ⌘+⇧+’

Displays the currently playing song in Spotify in Atom’s status bar. Not essential, but fun.

JavaScript code intelligence for atom with Tern. Adds support for ES5, ES6, ES7, Node.js, jQuery, Angular and more. Extendable via plugins. Uses suggestion provider by autocomplete-plus.

Will automatically add closing tags when you complete the opening tag.

Coolness of emmet, for css-modules.  will now expand to instead of .

A collection of commands and ES6 focused snippets for optimizing modern Javascript development productivity. It aims to be compliant with AirBnB’s mostly reasonable approach to Javascript.

Go to definition of JS variables/imports. js-hyperclick requires hyperclick.

A package to display colors in project and files.

This linter plugin for Linter provides an interface to eslint. It will be used with files that have the “JavaScript” syntax.

Allows you to copy relative path to file from tree view.

Some snippets to quickly use Lo-Dash Library in Atom.
