3D inversive geometry

Where we we find ways of filling spheres with spheres and do other strange things with this simplest of all 3D objects... Advanced geometry

Where we find Penrose, Voronoi and hyperbolic tilings..and where we have some fun with circles and spheres.We also encounter math surfaces, plane-filling curves, knot dynamics and take a mathematical look at the shape of Planet Earth.
