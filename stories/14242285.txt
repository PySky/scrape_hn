Every week, I get an email asking something like this:

Allow me to be sarcastic.

Perhaps the most popular question for writers is “Where do you get your ideas?”

Guess what? The people who ask this are, inevitably, not writers. For real writers, ideas are never the problem.

It’s the same for reading — those who ask how to find good books are (generally) the people who don’t read.

Each good book gives dozens, if not hundreds, of new paths to explore. The more you read, the more there is to read. The problem for readers is not finding books — we have too many — but choosing what to read.

But let me answer seriously.

I think of this problem in two parts:

If you read 24 hours a day for a whole year, you will finish 2000–3000 books.

A million new books are published each year. You’re never going to read them all.

Luckily, we don’t want to read everything. This is because:

Reading too much, especially on the wrong stuff, can hurt us. Here’s Argentine philosopher Mario Bunge writing on information overload, from Philosophy in Crisis:

Over the years, I’ve developed some heuristics (mental shortcuts) for finding good books to read.

First, a general principle I like to use:

This principle helps us weed out the sensational, low-signal-high-noise books. You would never read a book on martial arts by someone who has never been in a live fight. It should be the same for books.

Now, the heuristics I use:

I do the above steps constantly. This means I always have a running list of books to read.

But how to choose what to read next?

Here are a couple heuristics I use to do this:

Finding books to read is not hard.

Much harder is finding the time to do it.|||
