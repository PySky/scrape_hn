I ordered a Noradress gown for my daughter's pageant, and was pleasantly surprised. I was able to get custom measurements, which is important for us, as she is so tall, that standard length dresses seldom fit her. The price was great, and the dress arrived very promptly. The quality exceeded my expectations, and looked beautiful on. Will definitely recommend them to anyone, and will certainly order from them again. June Kovar|||
