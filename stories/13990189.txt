Using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at high magnification, hundreds of images of the nano sculpture were captured as a Piezo stage was rotated to a precision of below one ten thousandth of a degree.  Each individual frame in the sequence can take several minutes to capture (depending on resolution), meaning that one second of film can take up to 4 hours to film.  A painstakingly detailed process, in which any micro-blip means starting again from scratch.  This is all done with an ground-breaking optical system developed by Stefan Diller, Wuerzburg, Germany called Nanoflight.Creator.  The only system in the world capable of SEM film.

An SEM does not use photons (normal light) to capture an image.  Electrons are focused on to the specimen which is coated in gold and rebounds are measured, forming a “picture” based on the reflection intensity of the electrons.  The effect of this from a filmic perspective is that one is not operating in an environment of light.  Shadows and “colour” behave differently and at this quantum level and our traditional expectations of light have to be thrown out the window.  All manageable for a single picture, but when compositing thousands of individual photographs it becomes a different story completely.  A series of techniques and technologies drawn from the special effects world needs to be applied in post-production to create a stable film.

In summary, the creation of these films involves a wonderfully diverse set of technologies from bespoke electronics and software, to quantum physics and leading-edge scientific tool to modern special effects.  A feat of art and science at its most beautiful.|||
