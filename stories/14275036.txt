Here is the first look at what Amazon’s upcoming Echo with a built-in touchscreen looks like. I was able to locate this unfortunately low resolution image on Amazon’s servers in a similar manner to how I found what we now know to be the Echo Look. This new member of the Echo lineup is codenamed “Knight” and is expected to be released later this month.

Similar to my past leaks, I don’t have much information other than the image itself. We know from past sources that this will be the flagship Alexa device in Amazon’s lineup. It’s expected to have better sounding speakers than the current Amazon Echo. The screen is rumored to be a touchscreen that’s 7 inches in size.

Early rumors suggested the screen would articulate, but judging by the above image, that does not appear to be the case. Instead, it looks like the device is angled upwards slightly. This would allow it to be used while standing above it if, for example, it were sitting on a countertop. Below the screen appears to be the main speakers.

Above the screen is a slightly lighter circle that looks to be a camera. Numerous rumors have been floating around that Amazon will be adding phone calling capabilities to the Echo. If this new Echo with a screen does in fact have a camera, it’s possible that it will be able to make video calls as well, in addition to voice calls. The whole device does strongly resemble a video phone.

An exact release date is unknown, but considering the nature of where I found this image, I expect it will be released this month. Pricing is also unknown, but since this is expected to be a device superior to the current Amazon Echo, you can expect it to be above $200, but probably below $300.|||
