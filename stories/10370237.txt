Example notebooks for the last part which are multivariate models are available in the PR and will still be added to master.

Since all the statespace models are new code, we would really, really, really appreciate feedback.

There is a very large amount of functionality in the models that Chad developed with many different options or covering many different cases. Even a test coverage above 90 or 95% doesn't guarantee that there are no "kinks" in there.

So, please report back if you see anything "strange".

I merged the last of the statespace models that Chad wrote in his GSOC.|||
