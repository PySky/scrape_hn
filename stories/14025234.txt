Nokia, once an undisputed market leader, made big announcements at Mobile World Congress 2017 and left its fans waiting for the Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 apart from the legendary 3310. According to the new rumors, Nokia is likely to release a flagship smartphone with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 around May-July time frame . The new flagship is expected to come in two sizes similar to that of Google Pixel sizes.

The new flagship mobile with all-metal body and sporting a dual camera is likely to compete Galaxy S8. Both variants will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset, and both should get either 4 or 6GB of RAM depending upon the model.

It will feature neither Carl Zeiss nor PureView technology but the primary camera will feature a 23-megapixel sensor. However, the exact specifications of the premium smartphones are not yet confirmed but it can be expected to come with top-class features and hardware.

Being the top of the line models that they will be, you’d assume they’ll also be quite expensive and it turns out that’s just the case. The rumors in China claim the smaller one will go for CNY 4,000 or more ($579 or €549), while the bigger one will retail for at least CNY 4,500 ($652 or €617).
