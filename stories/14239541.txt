Up until now, was my main method of interacting with the server APIs I write. But at @krjackson’s advice, I decided to give Postman a try. I was not disappointed. (For those that aren’t initiated, Postman is an awesome tool for developing, monitoring, and testing APIs.) I’m now steadily building a collection of saved API requests as we build out Blue Matador’s predictive alerting engine, smart agent, and intuitive dashboards for monitoring log data. I love Postman, and recommend it to anyone who’s still a slave to (I’m looking at you, @mbarlocker).

Postman recommends installing its native app, but there wasn’t any documentation for installing it on Ubuntu — just a download link. So, in order to make it easier for fellow Ubuntu users to start with Postman, here are some quick commands to get set up!

As a bonus, here’s a command to create an Unity desktop file for your launcher. After you create the file, logout and then log back in, you’ll be able to search for “Postman” in your Unity launcher to start up the Postman app.|||

I finally hopped on the Postman bandwagon … and found there was no documentation for installing it on Ubuntu. So here it is. You’re welcome!
