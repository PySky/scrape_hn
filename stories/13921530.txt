Blue Wave (http://www.blue-wave.de) sponsored »Es lebe der König!«'s (http://www.eslebederkoenig.com) »Im Namen der Republik.«, a literature event hosted at the DAI (http://www.dai-heidelberg.de) in Heidelberg. 



Blue Wave built the ELDK website in 3D using Impress.js, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. A drawing app was embedded on the site so anyone could draw on the site and add their art to the gallery. 



At the event a rear projector with a Microsoft Kinect system was built up so guests could interact with the site and draw pictures at the festival. The Kinect was controlled with NITE, OpenNI, and LKB, with a Java mouse app that was used to move the cursor in sync with hand gestures.



The interactive touchscreen installation and website were updated in real time so any visitor of the website could see the ongoing art project at the ELDK festival. 



The music for this video clip is by Broke For Free (http://www.brokeforfree.com) entitled Night Owl. Make sure to check out Broke For Free for the most amazing tracks!
