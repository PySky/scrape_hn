This repository host all the artworks that are on sales on the website HexStickers.com.

The material on this pages is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.

What I want to achieve with this license is to give to everybody the possibility to print these stickers by themselves.

However you cannot sell them, if you want to buy them you are welcome to do so in the website HexStickers.com.

There are a total of 20 stickers for 20 different well know technologies, you can browser the repository or see them all in our website HexStickers.com

The stickers are hexagonal so that can be tiled in any surface and they will look awesome and well curate.

We followed the standard proposed by Terin Stock in his repo: StickerConstructorSpec.

Following this specification means that you can use our stickers next to the one of other vendors.

Under the folder you will find all and 20 our technologies, inside each folder there are two files.

The PNG is the simple image that can be showed in the web, however is difficult to modify and to work with.

The SVG is simpler to modify and is actually ready to be printed, there is a blue dashed border line which is where the sticker should be cut. If you actually go to print the sticker you will need that line.

If you would like different technologies in the same style there are two main way.

Please consider that we all have a full time job, so we do not guarantee that we have the actual time to work on it.

However if you bribe us (with any order in our website) and you ask for another technology that we don't have yet, we guarantee that we will design it and include it in your package.

I know, I just bought the domain and I am moving the whole website.

I tried. I open an issues in their repo and I also send an email.|||
