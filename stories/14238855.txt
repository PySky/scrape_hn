Last September, we covered the Brisbane Baylands project and, as is all too common with Bay Area housing development, the approval process has drug on and on.

Brisbane, just South of San Francisco, has a significant amount of empty land under its jurisdiction and there’s a proposal to put that land to better use. The project site sits between major job centers on the Peninsula and in SF, is well serviced by transit, and could undergo development without the possibility of displacing even a single person (it’s literally empty land). The developer is proposing a mixed use development that would include 4,400 units of new housing. And in typical Bay Area fashion, the Brisbane Planning Commission is recommending absolutely no housing be built at all.

On May 4th, the Brisbane City Council will hold a land use hearing to review the project and this will be one of the final opportunities to push the council in the right direction. Here’s how you can help:

Public speaking, letter writing, and petition signing all matter because getting housing built in the Bay Area is, unfortunately, still a negotiation. Projects are approved at the discretion of local councils and when all they ever hear are the most NIMBY voices in the room, they say no to housing with impunity. Consistent pressure can bring even the most anti-housing officials to the table to make a deal and deal is exactly what we need here. The louder we yell, the more housing we’ll get and come May 4th we’ll need everyone making their voices heard.|||
