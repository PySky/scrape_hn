It’s my habit to spend the year preparing a list of the books I want to read during holidays.

I’ve read the lists of the most linked books in Hacker News, Stack Overflow and others, but they’re way too technical, and business-oriented.

A reading list should be mind opening. There should be surprises in it. Stuff you never heard about before. And stuff you’ve been waiting to read for decades.

Let a little bit of serendipity sip in by adding a few recommendations from amazon, goodreads or your local bookshop keeper, and here you are.

Don’t worry if you don’t read everything. It’s not some university course material. Maybe you’ll end your reading later. Maybe you won’t. Who cares. Nobody will be judging you. Don’t worry also if you don’t like everything. It’s good to read books you hate.
