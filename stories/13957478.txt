Go package for mapping values to and from space-filling curves, such as Hilbert and Peano curves.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.

Create a Hilbert curve for mapping to and from a 16 by 16 space. , hilbert. ( ) Create a Peano curve for mapping to and from a 27 by 27 space. Now map one dimension numbers in the range [0, N*N-1], to an x,y coordinate on the curve where both x and y are in the range [0, N-1]. , , s. (t) Also map back from (x,y) to t. , s. (x, y)

The demo directory contains an example on how to draw an images of Hilbert and Peano curves, as well as animations of varying sizes for both.

and the following images are generated.
