For Windows users who do not use Java we highly recommend the free SSH client putty.exe.

 If you do not want to use putty, you can try the built in Windows TELNET Client.

If you have any questions or cannot figure out how to use SSH, live help

 is available on IRC via irc.sdf.org in the #helpdesk channel.|||
