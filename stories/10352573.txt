Amazon Elasticsearch Service makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. The service offers built-in integrations with Kibana, Logstash, and AWS services including Amazon Kinesis Firehose, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch so that you can go from raw data to actionable insights quickly.

It’s easy to get started with Amazon Elasticsearch Service. You can set up and configure your Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain in minutes from the AWS Management Console. Amazon Elasticsearch Service provisions all the resources for your domain and launches it. The service automatically detects and replaces failed Elasticsearch nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructure and Elasticsearch software. Amazon Elasticsearch Service allows you to easily scale your cluster via a single API call or a few clicks in the console. With Amazon Elasticsearch Service, you get direct access to the Elasticsearch open-source API so that code and applications you’re already using with your existing Elasticsearch environments will work seamlessly.
