These graphs are sampled periodically from our own internal metrics about the performance and availability of GitHub services. Theyâ€™re accurate to within a few minutes.

We provide a GitHub Site Status API for consuming this information. If you're a service that integrates with GitHub, you can use these JSON responses to populate your own status dashboard.|||
