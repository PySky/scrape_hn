We all know what happened with last year’s Galaxy Note 7, but Samsung doesn’t show any signs of letting it go! The South Korean manufacturer is preparing to launch a revamped variant of the handset, going by the name of Galaxy Note 7R.

Don’t expect too many differences, though, since the only notable change is the battery, which, according to a couple of leaked images, will have a capacity of 3200mAh. Also, the operating system will be Android 7.0 Nougat, instead of 6.0 Marshmallow, like the previous version had.

Otherwise, we’re looking forward to seeing pretty much the same phone, in terms of both design and specs!

The Samsung Galaxy Note 7R will have a 5.7″ display, with a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, being powered by Samsung’s own Exynos 8990, alongside 4GB of RAM. The camera department will be represented by a 12MP main shooter, as well as a 5MP one, on the front.

In terms of price, the reports are pointing to 700,000 Korean Won, which roughly translates to $620. Last year, when it was introduced, the original Galaxy Note 7 had a starting price of $900, which means that the new Galaxy Note 7R will get a $250 price cut.

Until date, Samsung hasn’t confirmed if the new Note 7R will be available worldwide or just in South Korea. Still, it was spotted in the FCC database, so there might be a chance of seeing it hitting other markets as well! After all, it’s still a great handset, offering top notch specs for a good price!|||
