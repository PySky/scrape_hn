This script has a very simple purpose: it monitors a remote irssi session (as in the case when running irssi in tmux or screen on a remote machine) and pops up growl notifications on your local machine when you have new mentions, direct messages, or optionally when activity occurs in a list of named channels.

This script and general approach was adopted from this blogpost by Michał Łomnicki.

The first part remotely executes the command, which prints new lines as they are written to the logs. If you've set your logging directory to be other than the default, put it in the place of . The part after the is the script. The arguments are simple: -u lets you specify a word to monitor (e.g. your username) and lets you specify any number of channels; you will receive notifications for all events in these.

If this is useful to you it probably needs to be improved. Open an issue and let's chat about it. :)|||
