LookSee is a tech recruitment programme run by Haines NZ Ltd (a recruitment agency, trading as Workhere New Zealand) and fronted by the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency (WREDA) with funding from Immigration New Zealand.

LookSee Wellington is open to candidates who already hold the legal right to live and work in New Zealand (and also candidates who may be granted the legal right to live and work in New Zealand).

Each candidate must answer all of these questions to submit a LookSee application:

I asked Haines: "Are these questions required? Are answers (or non-answers) to these questions used for screening candidates and/or made available to employers?"

I asked Haines: "Are answers to those questions required of candidates who already hold the legal right to live and work in New Zealand? Are answers (or non-answers) to those questions made available to employers and/or used for screening candidates who already hold the legal right to live and work in New Zealand?"

I asked WREDA: "Are answers (or non-answers) to those questions made available to employers?"

I asked WREDA: "Are answers (or non-answers) to those questions used for screening candidates who already hold the legal right to live and work in New Zealand?"

Many of those questions are a breach of sections 21 (1) (b) "marital status", (g) "ethnic or national origins", (h) "disability", (i) "age", (k) "employment status", or (l) "family status", and 22 (2) and 23 of the Human Rights Act.

It shall be unlawful for any person to use or circulate any form of application for employment or to make any inquiry of or about any applicant for employment which indicates, or could reasonably be understood as indicating, an intention to commit a breach of section 22.|||
