These are examples of challenging signs that are properly transcribed by our system by selecting or combining understanding across images. The second example is extremely challenging by itself, but the model learned a language model prior that enables it to remove ambiguity and correctly read the street name. Note that in the FSNS dataset, random noise is used in the case where less than four independent views are available of the same physical sign.|||
