A year and a half or so ago, when we first met, I was downing 3+ (actually, I didn't count, it was a lot) cups of coffee per day, barely sleeping, barely eating, and working every single hour that I could think of working. I wanted to be free, to be successful, to save up money, to start a company, to do many things. I had no time for rest, I thought.

Meanwhile I'd watch Rich work in his job at the time. He'd work from home mostly. He'd always get 8+ hours sleep. He coded maybe 5 hours a day tops, if he really needed to, usually less. He ate super well, always exercised and took care of his health. He was really successful. He had lots of time for rest.

As time passed and I compared our two ways of living, I realized something was not adding up here. Maybe I was doing things wrong.|||
