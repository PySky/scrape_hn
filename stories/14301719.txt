One way to solve that is by approaching problem solving with solutions, not ideas. People easily get married to their ideas and they have a hard time being objective and changing their mind if they’re wrong. Having too strong of an emotional attachment to your ideas makes you less logical in my opinion.

When you propose solutions, you’re directly answering to a problem. Your emotional attachment isn’t to the solution, it’s to the problem. Every member of a group should understand the problem and use it as an anchor-point for critique.

If someone proposes a design change, give your feedback based on how that design solves the problem you’ve set out to solve. If there is a new feature proposed, see how that fits into your product roadmap and priorities. If someone wants to rebuild the codebase, help them understand the time and opportunity cost.

Let a thousand flowers bloom and pick the sweetest. The wisdom of the crowd can only prevail if you allow for diversity, independence, and decentralization to take form.|||
