The Irishman is the ultimate gangster film project that fantasizes all Scorsese fans since its announcement in 2008. Scorsese’s film would bring together Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the third time after Heat 1995 by Michael Mann and Righteous Kill 2008 by Jon Avnet, and for the first time under the camera of the American filmmaker and alongside Joe Pesci.

Scorsese says about his attraction to the project:

“It’s about love, betrayal, remorse and the sadness and tragedy, ultimately, of a life led that way. And it’s about mercy too, I don’t know if there’ll be any of that in the picture yet, there might be.”

And about any similarity with Goodfellas, Scorsese said:

“I think this is different, I think it is,”  “I admit that there are – you know, Goodfellas and Casino have a certain style that I created for them – it’s on the page in the script actually.  Putting Goodfellas together was almost like an afterthought, at times I was kind of rushing, I felt I’d already done it because I’d played it all out in terms of the camera moves and the editing and that sort of thing. The style of the picture, the cuts, the freeze-frames, all of this was planned way in advance, but here it’s a little different. “The people are also older in The Irishman, it’s certainly more about looking back, a retrospective so to speak of a man’s life and the choices that he’s had to make.”

The Irishman is based on a book by Charles Brandt: I Heard You Paint Houses, and tells the story of a mob hit man as he recalls his possible involvement with the slaying of Jimmy Hoffa.

The Irishman will start filming in August, and is aiming for a 2019 release date.|||
