No this isn’t a shameless plug for a go pro its a call for all you young entrepreneurs to get use to the one thing that’s hard to roll out if you don’t know the first thing about wheels.

Whatever you do you have to do it with your own unique style. That is really hard to do because there is always haters trying to beat your door and you down. Do you know that when I started the “Evil Slapper” meme I was blasted for being immature and people said I should grow up. Boy an I glad I didn’t listen to their nonsense. It has taken a while and a lot of work but it as all really worked out very well for me. Why? Because I stayed true to my vision and forced it into reality.

Stay in your groove, do your own thing and let the haters hate. Push your message hard, when you can’t push no more think of ways to push it even harder. Motivation is the shining light people. Get a stick put it on a pole and plug in mega voltage to the light at the top (YOU).

You will Shine, have a little faith in yourself

That is all, move along|||
