I’ve always had the impression that America is the global superpower. However, like all countries, America has problems. It’s incarceration rate is the highest in the world, which contributes to a highly ineffective criminal justice system. In addition, the citizens of the country that has the world’s largest economy aren’t even guaranteed universal healthcare. Moreover, America’s infrastructure is decaying and is far behind the rest of the world.

What is it about America that makes it so powerful? It’s large economy? Military spending?

In other words, what do we mean by describing America as a “superpower”?

“A country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, and sometimes, in more than one region of the globe at a time, and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemony.” - Dr. Alice Lyman Miller

There’s no doubt that America is a huge global influence ever since the Industrial Revolution. Through economic and military power, the United States attempts to achieve this status of “global hegemony”. America wants to be the leader of the world. Even though this might seem very enticing, I believe that America tries so much to attain this status that it fails to recognize it’s own problems.

Ever since WWII, or even the Cold War, America has been exceeding interest in the affairs of countries rooted in political, economic, social, and military reason. Whether it be the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 or the recent airstrikes in Mosul, the truth is that America is focusing more on maintaining it’s status outside the borders, not within.

Setting everything else aside, America still remains the land of opportunity. Built by immigrants, it will remain the superpower for the next couple decades as long as we stand by our constitution.

Maybe being less powerful can solve America's greatest problems
