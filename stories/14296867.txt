It’s a pain to print things out and backlit screens can be unpleasant to look at (and may even disturb your sleep). In service to my eyeballs, the environment, and you, my readers, I set out to read scientific papers on my Kindle Paperwhite.

The Kindle can load pdfs, but each page appears small on the screen. Zooming in is slow, clumsy and distracts from the reading experience. Amazon provides a conversion service where you can email a pdf to them with the subject line ‘convert’ and it will sync a Kindle version to your device. However, many papers include equations and two dimensional layouts. Often figures are disassociated from their captions, there are many spacing errors, and equations are illegible.

I have found that it is possible to manually linearize a paper and submit it to Amazon for conversion and this gives a good (though not perfect) result. Additionally, and obviously given the device’s capabilities, color figures can sometimes be difficult or impossible to interpret. However, about half the time shades of gray are sufficient.

Below is an example of the output of steps 1–7. My lab put out an open access article on retinal neuroscience. I took the liberty of putting it in Kindle-friendly form as a demonstration.

There’s also a tool called k2pdfopt that I played with on the command line. The tool gave pretty good text results with only setting the margin to 0.2in. However, it didn’t do so well with most of the figures. I attached my best result below.
