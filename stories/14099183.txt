How I left my consulting career behind and broke into tech

Three months ago, I moved to San Francisco — one of the most expensive cities on Earth — with no job, no housing, and barely any money.

Plenty of people thought it was crazy. They’d thought I was crazy to leave behind a prosperous career in consulting five months ago, and they really thought I was crazy now.

But here I am. Today I have a dream role at a startup as a Product Manager building out a mobile application with people I love. So how did I get here? And, more importantly, why do you care?

This isn’t a how-to article, but rather a knowledge drop of all the things I experienced over the past few months, and everything I’ve learned from those experiences.

Always keep in mind that the world is ever-changing. Don’t let yourself lag behind.

It was September 27, 2016. After months of contemplating the big move, I called my friend Prateek. I was seeking guidance, as he made a similar move roughly a year prior. I told him of my plans to try and get into a coding bootcamp like Hack Reactor or App Academy to hone in on my technical skills, so I could eventually be better suited for a product management role.

He then put me in contact with his friend Artur, with whom I scheduled a call shortly after. Artur made a transition into software engineering from investment banking, after attending Hack Reactor.

I told Artur the same thing I told Prateek. What he said next sealed the deal, and my mind was made up.

I’m paraphrasing his words, but you get the idea. Artur kick-started what would become one hell of a journey for me, and a friendship between Artur, his twin brother, Timur, and Ruben — the Breaking into Startups crew.|||
