There are other ways in which you can make money from your website too. For example, when your blog starts to grow in popularity, you could add an online store to the blog. This will give people a chance to buy some merchandise. This can generate a decent amount of money for you. Alternatively, you could host events, webinars and talks.

Look for as many unique and creative ways to work alongside these sponsors as you can. It could be a huge money-spinner for your blog.
