The Safeweb Engine can be installed on either virtual, physical or cloud servers and is designed to physically isolate the web browsing activity of large amounts of internet users in a cost effective way.   Because of the Safeweb Engines unique container based architecture, it is massively scalable and requires minimal server resources when compared to the existing browser isolation cybersecurity platforms currently available on the market.

By physically isolating web browsing activity onto the Safeweb platform, cyber threats such as malware, advanced persistent threats and viruses are completely unable to get a foothold on the users machine, protecting the user from web based threats in real time as they browse the internet, effectively isolating the user from anything likely to infect their local machine.

The Safeweb Engine is massively scalable and capable of physically isolating the browsing activity of millions of simultaneous internet users, enabling organization's to cost effectively protect a large amount of users from as little as $5 dollars per user, per month.

The Safeweb Engine is now available for download and testing and if you wish to try out the Safeweb Engine on your own servers, but you must first register at tuCloud.com.
