Lego compatible tape is such a great idea, we’re amazed it’s not an official Lego product already.

Nimuno’s Lego tape is an adhesive plastic strip with Lego bumps on one side. It allows you to turn anything into a Lego compatible surface, from walls to toys to your own body.

This video shows the product in action.

The tape is being crowdfunded on Indiegogo, where you can order a couple of rolls for $11. Nimuno already reached its original goal with a month to go, so this toy is clearly as popular as you’d expect.|||
