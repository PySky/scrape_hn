Material Dashboard PRO is a Premium Material Bootstrap Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google’s Material Design. It is based on the popular Bootstrap framework and comes packed with multiple third-party plugins. All components are built to fit perfectly with each other while aligning to the material concepts.

Material Dashboard PRO makes use of light, surface, and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple layers so that the depth and order are obvious. Inside the archive, you will find multiple example pages on how to use all components. And, of course, every element is documented.
