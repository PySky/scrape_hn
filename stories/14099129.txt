Feature Release for Akka.NET

 Akka.NET 1.2 is a major feature release that introduces the following major changes:

 The biggest change for 1.2 is the removal of Helios 2.0 as the default transport and the introduction of DotNetty. The new DotNetty transport is fully backwards compatible with the Helios 1.4 and 2.* transports, so you should be able to upgrade from any Akka.NET 1.* application to 1.2 without any downtime. All of the HOCON is also supported by the DotNetty transport, so none of that needs to updated for the DotNetty transport to work out of the box.

In addition, the DotNetty transport supports TLS, which can be enabled via the following HOCON:
