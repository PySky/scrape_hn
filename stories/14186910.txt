Web browsers throttle calls to setTimeout when the tab is in the background, which tends to break timing-sensitive things like WebAudio. unthrottle.js bounces the calls off of a WebWorker (which aren't throttled when the tab is backgrounded) so you get normal behaviour at all times.

As with the default implimentation, you can cancel a pending timeout using the clearTimeoutUnthrottled() function:

You can also replace the default functions to avoid all that extra typing (it's a drop-in replacement, so no other changes are required):|||
