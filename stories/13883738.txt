Sean’s journey has been a long one. After leaving his job at Verizon Wireless, he started Flurry in 2005.

He started Flurry at a time that apps weren’t really that popular. Analysts predicted that apps were just a fad? During that time, apps hadn’t taken off yet, so the future of Flurry wasn’t obvious. As the app space continued to scale over the years, Yahoo bought Flurry for $300 — $350 million dollars!

All that didn’t come easy though. Flurry was insolvent three times but somehow they were able to make it out the other end. They could have easily given up but decided to keep pushing — and it worked.

Sean’s journey is a telltale story for founders to be prepared for the difficult and long road ahead; it is an emotional roller coaster. One day you’re smooth sailing and the other it’s impossible to put out all the fires.
