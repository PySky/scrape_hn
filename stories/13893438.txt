On the heels of my mounting frustration with Stack Overflow, yesterday I tried to delete one of my posts there which had lead me into a sort of infinite loop of annoyance. I thought it best for my own mental health to cut the knot of my annoyance and extricate myself from the whole situation.

So I went to the post, clicked delete, and confirmed my choice:

Only to find out, hm, I can’t delete my post. Which is weird, because it says above that I can, asks me to confirm and then says:

So I wrote to Support asking them to delete it.

They sent me back what is obviously a macro:

Since I’m in the support game myself, I figured I would test out a little macro of my own that I’ve been developing.

See, this isn’t the first time I’ve encountered a company that won’t delete my content. And I find this highly objectionable. In the past, I’d tried to get Patreon to delete my account (which I’d never used) and they told me they “can’t.” Yeah, right. Anyway, since then I’ve been researching user rights under other jurisdictions and thought I would fly an experimental play up the flagpole and see what happens.

So I went with my “Hail Mary” and invoked Article 17, EU GDPR — the Right of Erasure, and upped the ante to request deletion of all my content:

They wrote back to me, in part:

Actually, I’m pretty sure it’s entirely relevant. But what do I know. Companies hoarding data about users without any oversight — this is a big deal. Sadly, only the European Union so far, that I know of, has decided to enshrine this into law. The US doesn’t seem to give a shit about this…

Of course, I never mentioned I’m not an EU citizen. Pfff — Technicalities! But I only invoked the law, I never said I was subject to it. (See also: legal pluralism)

By that token, I’m not a resident of New York or the United States, where Stack Overflow is based and hence the venue of its Terms— and I reject also this notion that tech companies are only bound by the laws where they are incorporated and are not responsible to the needs of users in other jurisdictions.

In any event, I knew they had beaten my Right to be forgotten macro, so I pivoted and went DMCA on them. This is a grey area, but I felt justified based on their own Terms:

Since I am in fact the rights holder of my content, I think there is strong (though perhaps not in the end entirely legally-sound) argument to be made that they are now infringing on my copyright by not removing my content as requested.

Except of course, that whole thing that I’d inadvertently — also under their Terms — given them a “perpetual irrevocable license” to use my content. What can I say, I didn’t read through or think deeply about the implications of their Terms when I signed up

Rather than mince words though, I filed my own DMCA notice on behalf of myself and sent it to them. Might have been unorthodox, but I wasn’t seeing a lot of other options left to me.

I guess this was just too much for them though. They told me it was a “pointless effort” and (confirmed my suspicion) that this isn’t really how DMCA works — but, hey, you can’t blame a guy for trying. All I freakin’ wanted was to delete a post that I wrote.

Anyway, I thought their closing remarks were a bit rude, though perhaps in their eyes warranted to shake me loose as a “bad actor.” They wrote:

Evidently, I was not the only person frustrated at this point. And I was antagonizing for sure. “Support Rage” goes in both directions though, let me tell you —

But calling my request to delete ONE POST from their network of millions (billions?) “nonsense” and threatening to “completely ignore” me — well that seems like going too far. That got my 🐐. Especially since their own UI offers me the option to delete my post in the first place, and even asks me to confirm the choice.

I tried pleading with them nicely once more to no avail — but maybe my idea of “nice” was at this point pretty warped. It might be safe to say I’ve about made a break from consensus reality. But I also think that if users don’t push back against tech companies and their sometimes arbitrary, one-sided and harsh rules over content WE PROVIDE THEM FOR FREE, then we will be the ones who end up being used.

Not being able to easily let things like this go once I set myself to them (and now married to the principle of the thing), I switched tactics one last time and asked them to simply fix their UI so that the option to never appears at all on questions which can’t be deleted. I mean, that one simple change — which is more in-line with their Terms anyway — would likely have headed this situation off at the pass (or not, I might still have pushed).

They kindly wrote back and informed me this had been brought up already in their Meta section (dated to August 2016), and that they would fix it “some time in the future.”|||

Sometimes I wonder if in an FBI file somewhere there’s a record of all the annoyed/annoying letters I’ve ever sent to companies complaining about their products or services… And some day I’ll wind up…
