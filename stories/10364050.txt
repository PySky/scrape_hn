The intense competition for admission to highly selective colleges and universities is destroying our kids. Suniya Luthar has spent about 20 years studying and documenting the growth of dysfunction among upper middle class youth, the prime candidates for admission to selective colleges. Luthar has found that extreme substance abuse, clinical depression, eating disorders and promiscuous sex are growing fast among these young people. Could there be a connection between these trends and the stress associated with applying to college? I think so.

About 10 years ago, I suggested that admission to highly selective institutions should be done by lottery. Every selective school should establish criteria that students would have to meet to have a high likelihood of being successful. Then, the names of all applicants who meet these criteria would be put into a hat and the winners would be drawn at random.

A lottery system would relieve the pressure on students. Instead of being the “best,” they would only have to be “good enough” — and lucky. It would free students up to do the things they were really passionate about in high school. And it would enable colleges to be straight with the public about what they are currently doing. Any honest admissions dean will tell you that the current system already is a lottery. Only now, it’s disguised as a meritocracy.

By easing the pressure, a lottery may get teenagers to see the college admissions letter as the starting line, not the finish line, which in turn will make them more engaged and enthusiastic — better students — when college begins.|||
