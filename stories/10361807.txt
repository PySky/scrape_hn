Course Hero is always looking to try new and exciting ideas to help us build our team and keep up with our rocketship product growth. Inspired by some conversations with industry leaders, including our friends at Entelo, we’re excited to roll out our latest initiative: Exponential Referral Bonuses.

The basic idea is this:

Employees making referrals start getting bonuses at the very beginning of the process, starting with the first phone screen, in amounts that exponentially increase up to a successful hire.

It may be easiest to explain by working backwards. For a successful hire, the bonus is $X,000. For each stage of the hiring pipeline, the bonuses scale as follows:

To clarify, you don’t receive every bonus—only the maximum one, representing how far the candidate advanced.

Why are we excited to try this program? Sometimes it can be intimidating to think about the chances a referral will actually be hired. There are many reasons it might not happen—they’re not interested enough, the process is difficult, the timing isn’t right, and so on. But with this program, you only need to get them on the phone before you start earning rewards. We believe this will overcome some inertia and lead to more good referrals.

Obviously, there are a few rules. Referrals must be qualified. Hiring criteria can’t be changed or manipulated. We need to be confident that everyone supports the spirit of what we’re trying to accomplish and help the company.

Finally, one other change we’ve made is to give the same bonus for every position. Previously, some positions (such as engineers and designers) earned larger bonuses because of the competitive job market, but after further consideration, we feel strongly that every hire is a critical one, and therefore deserves the best bonus we can offer.

Please let us know if you would like to join Course Hero and take part in our referral bonus program yourself!|||
