This language is a superset of Lisp and Lua.

Lisp names are mangled into Lua by replacing non lua compliant characters with lua compliant characters. (See the mangle function in l2l/reader.lua).

Lisp names can contain dashes, dots, alphabets, numbers, underscores, and many more characters, but they must not consist of two dots consecutively unless the name is (lua string concat) or (lua vararg).

This is so the compiler can mangle lua field accessor names properly.

Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly,

 Or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.

 — Zhuangzi

I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are one;

 One I seek, One I know, One I see, One I call.

 — Jalaluddin Rumi

Now I do not know whether I was writing Lua inside of Lisp,

 Or whether I am now writing Lisp, inside of Lua.

 I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are one;

 One I read. One I write. One I compile. One I run.

 — You

I am the servant of the Qur'an as long as I have life.

 I am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen one.

 If anyone quotes anything except this from my sayings,

 I am quit of him and outraged by these words.

 — Jalaluddin Rumi|||
