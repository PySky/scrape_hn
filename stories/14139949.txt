Hisar WebCLI provides modular component development without dependencies. NetCoreStack.Hisar supports any standalone MVC app that it can be part of hosting application package as a component. Please check out NetCoreStack.Hisar on Github for more details. Each component-module should know what layout.cshtml looks like and then this tool can manage it for you. If you don't specify the main application directory it will create the default _Layout.cshtml page.|||
