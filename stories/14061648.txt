Twitter is finally making some changes — just not the ones we asked for.

On Friday — following the unveiling of its messy new replies feature — rather than making strides against the noted hate speech problem on Twitter, the social media platform revealed it would changing its default egg avatar to some weird AF other thing. Great.

The little egg avatar, a classic sign of a bot or troll account and often associated with harrassment, has been transformed into a new design that's meant to resemble the outline of a human's head and shoulders. But instead, it kind of just looks like one tiny, deformed egg hovering above one half of a slightly larger egg. Twitter announced the change in an overly detailed blog post on Friday.

Though Twitter has recently taken steps to fight back against abuse on the platform — such as making it easier to report abusive tweets and allowing users to mute desired keywords — one of the main complaints from Twitter users was that changing the appearance of the egg avatar should not be the company's priority.

They took to Twitter to vent their anger.

As you can imagine, with the death of the Twitter egg so close to Easter, many users were also feeling emotional about the loss.

And as is customary with most new features, people had a lot of jokes to make. Thus, the sad new grey image was mercilessly trolled on its very own site.

The hilarious Darth Twitter account had a field day with the new design, creating alternate heads and topical comparisons to items like spring Starbucks cups.

RIP eggs, you will be missed. Now, about that harassment problem...|||
