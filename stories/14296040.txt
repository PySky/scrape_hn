Code is really just instructions that are precise enough that a dumb computer can understand them.

A lot of non-coders seem to think that coders spend all day banging out code on their keyboard.

In reality, most coders spend their days thinking really hard about what exactly needs to be done, and all the ways things could go wrong in a system.

When non-coders propose “automating” coding, what they’re really talking about is automating critical thinking. And nothing short of general artificial intelligence will be able to do this completely.

The tools coders use get more powerful all the time. As a result, coders are able to operate at higher and higher levels of abstraction.

There may be a day in the future where we can completely automate coding. But considering that coding is the act of automation itself, coding will by definition be the last human job that we can fully automate.

If you’re considering learning to code, and you’re worried that coding will go away as a job, don’t be. There are only two situations where this could happen:

So coding isn’t going away any time soon. You should learn to code.

I only write about programming and technology. If you follow me I won’t waste your time.|||
