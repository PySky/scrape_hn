Tor 0.3.0.6 is the first stable release of the Tor 0.3.0 series.

With the 0.3.0 series, clients and relays now use Ed25519 keys to authenticate their link connections to relays, rather than the old RSA1024 keys that they used before. (Circuit crypto has been Curve25519-authenticated since 0.2.4.8-alpha.) We have also replaced the guard selection and replacement algorithm to behave more robustly in the presence of unreliable networks, and to resist guard- capture attacks.

This series also includes numerous other small features and bugfixes, along with more groundwork for the upcoming hidden-services revamp.

Per our stable release policy, we plan to support the Tor 0.3.0 release series for at least the next nine months, or for three months after the first stable release of the 0.3.1 series: whichever is longer. If you need a release with long-term support, we recommend that you stay with the 0.2.9 series.

If you build Tor from source, you can find it at the usual place on the website. Packages should be ready over the next weeks, with a Tor Browser release in late May or early June.

Below are the changes since 0.2.9.10. For a list of only the changes since 0.3.0.5-rc, see the ChangeLog file.|||
