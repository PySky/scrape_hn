 We are about to see a spectacular race on German highway between two magnificent supercars, Audi R8 V10 Plus and Porsche 911 Turbo S. The race is starting while both vehicles are going with a speed of 37 mph, one of the drivers is signalising the start with three beeps on the horn, after the third one the race starts. Iâ€™m just curious, if you were about to bet on this race, which one will you go for? Hold that thought, watch the video and see what happens, you might be surprised!|||
