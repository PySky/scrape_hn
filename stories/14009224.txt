The experimental Changes Panel in Canary displays your code changes in real-time. It works with CSS/Sass and JavaScript. The Changes Panel can display your style changes from both the Sources Panel and the Styles Pane in the Elements Panel.

Within the Changes Panel, you can click on the code diffs to be taken to the relevant line of code in the Sources Panel.

For any changes you wish to discard, there is the option to "Revert All Changes".|||
