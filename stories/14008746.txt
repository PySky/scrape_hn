What is the Sustainable Loading project?

Modern Web applications load code and data. Loading and processing (parsing, evaluating etc.) this data is not free, and negatively impacts the RAIL of the application. Further, as the apps become more complex, the code/data loading demands increase, and so does their impact. The impact becomes critical on mobile devices, leading to terrible user experience, unhappy users and developers.

Sustainable Loading is an initiative in Chrome to solve the problem of scalably loading complex applications with minimal impact on RAIL by giving developers the right tools, primitives, and narrative.|||
