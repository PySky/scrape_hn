I'm author of React UI Builder which is used in. Now I'm working on new version of the builder which will use hot reloading, Rect Router, Redux, Redux DevTools... and other stunning features.But I'm wondering if the builder can be used as CMS in conjunction with NodeJS - as platform, Express - as HTTP server (maybe plus nginx), StrongLoop - for creating REST interface (or maybe something else ?), MongoDB - as DB backend, and Atom to edit source code of web application.So, would it be handy to have such a container and to deploy it on some hosting ?|||
