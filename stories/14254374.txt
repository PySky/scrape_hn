Are you working properly on the ASO App Store Optimization strategy of your app? When was the last time you improved your app store listing? TheTool helps you see whether you’re on the right path.

Everything starts with a keyword research. When you are working on the ASO of your app, you must take into account all the features that describe your mobile application, but also all those keywords users are likely to search in the app stores so they can find it and download it.

Once you have worked out correctly your app’s On-Metadata, the competition begins. With TheTool you can measure how your keywords rankings evolve, how those app store keywords behave when you increase installs volume and also how they evolve in front of your competition.

What is not measured, can not be improved. With our tool you can achieve both goals.

ASO is a process, not a single shot. Thanks to TheTool you can view how the volume of searches and the difficulty of ranking for a keyword changes, both in Google Play and App Store.

In addition, we offer you suggestions of new keywords, so you can increase the number of total keywords that positions your app, find new trends, seasonal keywords, etc.

With TheTool your ASO will never be obsolete.|||
