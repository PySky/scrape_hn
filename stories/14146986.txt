You simply upload your Python code as a ZIP using the AWS CLI or Lambda console and select the "python3.6" runtime. You can also use the AWS Serverless Application Model to package and deploy Lambda functions. Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

Read about the Python programming model in the AWS Lambda documentation. Please visit our product pageÂ for more information on AWS Lambda.|||
