Learn Mode is an innovative new feature from Viki to facilitate language learning. This feature is available on Korean, Chinese & Taiwanese titles that have at least 50% subtitles in the origin language.

If a video has sufficient subtitles in the origin language (Korean or Chinese), the Learn Mode toggle will be available in the settings menu as shown below.

When Learn Mode is turned on, both the origin language and your preferred language subtitles tracks will appear together. In addition, arrows are visible just above the subtitles. These allow for easy navigation between different subtitle segments.

You will also see a replay button between the arrows which replays the current segment again to help you get a better grasp of the line.

Most importantly, you can now mouse over the Korean & Chinese subtitles and click on a particular word to get its definition as well as pronunciation in your preferred subtitle language. You will also notice that the video is paused when you move your mouse over the subtitles, this allows you to easily select the word you want without having to pause at the right time.

We do truly hope Learn Mode will allow you to get a step closer to your favorite Korean, Chinese & Taiwanese content by augmenting your understanding of the language. Â If you encounter any issues or would like to provide feedback, please do file a ticket with us here.
