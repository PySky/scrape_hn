Healthcare, Finance and Government sectors offer some of the most lucrative contracts for software development agencies, consultants and professional service firms. However, clients in these industries have the strictest level of compliance requirements including HIPAA and HITECH,  PCI, CJIS, FISMA and EU Data Protection.

Building a backend application that satisfies these regulatory compliance rules and protects the sensitive data of your client is a massive challenge for any vendor. Many firms don't even bother bidding on these projects in order to avoid the legal risk of getting the data security component wrong.

Crypteron takes care of the entire data security pipeline in minutes instead of months, including regulatory compliance. It's like adding a dedicated security engineering team to your staff at a fraction of the cost.

It takes minutes to add Crypteron to your projects so you can outbid the competition on both timeline and price. Tell your clients that their data is protected with 256 bit AES-GCM encryption and tamper protection, with multiple encryption keys. The keys themselves are also encrypted, stored remotely and rotated regularly via a key management system that can be locked down at a moment's notice in the event of a data breach. Did we mention that they get an audit trail as well?

You can even use a "Secured By Crypteron" badge to let customers know that security is taken seriously.|||
