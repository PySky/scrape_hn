TL;DR. IPFS is just a more convenient p2p software/protocal/network than others, that you can identify resources with unique hash. But the only value of IPFS is about sharing, without sharing there's no use of it.

It took me a whole day to read IPFS paper, docs and to play with it. at first glance of IPFS, it reminds me of NDN(Named Data Networking) which is a next generation network to identify resource by name on internet but then I realized it's totally different thing. IPFS is so great that I can't stop to digging more about it and trying to make most use of it. The things I know about it are:

Yes, that's true, but I doubt that it could really be the future of current network. Cause from what I see, IPFS is about sharing. As,

BUT, Without sharing IPFS is of nothing. IPFS is not really a permanent web. Let’s keep away all the tech side, in a view of user/developer of Internet, what’s the difference of IPFS and current network? Let’s say, you have a web site and put it on IPFS, every body visit it as a “normal” website but no one’s gonna keep it, the website is on IPFS for sure, with no one sharing, it doesn’t go faster, and once your server’s down, it’s gone.
