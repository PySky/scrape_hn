Today, we’re excited to announce that Cloud GPUs are generally available for use with Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Back in February, we announced the availability of NVIDIA K80 GPUs in beta for both Google Compute Engine and Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Our customers have seen significant performance improvements using these GPUs for machine learning.

We look forward to hearing how Cloud GPUs will help you scale and speed up your machine learning jobs on Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Learn more here about how to use Cloud GPUs on Google’s Cloud Machine Learning Engine.|||
