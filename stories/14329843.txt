Tonight we received notice that Moom is in violation of US patent number 8434019, Apparatus and method for positioning windows on a display. Yes, someone has patented positioning windows on a screen via a grid. Given we’ve been notified of a patent violation, we have no choice but to remove Moom from sale, effective immediately.

Honestly, we have no idea how to proceed here—the notice arrived at 8pm on a Friday evening, meaning it will be a few days until we can even speak to an attorney about our options, if any. We’re not a big company by any stretch, and certainly don’t have the resources for a patent fight.

Words of advice are welcome if you have experience in this area—we’ve reached out to the EFF‘s patent attorney, though I don’t know if we’ll get a reply. And we’ve got contacts with a few attorneys who may be able to help, but we won’t know for sure until we can talk to them after the weekend.

Until this matter is resolved, we cannot sell Moom in either the App Store or directly via our site. We are terribly frustrated by this, and hope to come to some resolution that allows us to continue to sell Moom. Until then, however, Moom is on an unplanned hiatus.
