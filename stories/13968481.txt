What is it? How does it work?

Snail Mail Congress is a tool that makes contacting your members of congress through postal mail even easier than sending an email. First, we help you find your elected representatives based on your address. Next, you write a short letter about an issue you care about and choose which reps to send it to. After you click send, we'll print out your letter(s), address them, apply postage and send them off!|||
