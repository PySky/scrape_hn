Makes the socket available to the children, anywhere below in the tree.

 An open is required for being able to use on sub-components.

If you want to instanciate the connection outside of the component, you should pass the instance as a prop:

Else the component can create it with the following parameters as props:

Connects a React component to a . Similarly to react-redux's , it doesn't modify the component passed to it but returns a new component connected to the instead.

In addition to connect the component's props to the socket's method, the new component will expose a and prop, for you to register a callback when a message is recieved from the server and to select the socket you want to connect to. For instance, if you already use react-redux, you can use use react-redux's on this new component to dispatch an action when a message arrives.

Similar to , except instead of exposing and as props on the returned component, it accepts a argument.

Same as plus :

In this example, 'Message' will be sent to the server when the button is clicked.

This Example is similar to the previous one but is used as a function.

In this example, we use the prop of the connected component to listen to the server. We also use react-redux to respond to such event by dispatching an action (see redux and react-redux documentation).|||
