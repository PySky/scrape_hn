An example of constructing a simple Virtual DOM library

This project demonstrates how to build a very simple Virtual DOM library in pure ClojureScript.

To get an interactive development environment run:

and open your browser at localhost:3449. This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

And open your browser in . You will not get live reloading, nor a REPL.
