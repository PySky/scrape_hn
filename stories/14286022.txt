Oboe.js is an open source Javascript library for loading JSON using streaming, combining the convenience of DOM with the speed and fluidity of SAX.

It can parse any JSON as a stream, is small enough to be a micro-library, doesn’t have dependencies, and doesn’t care which other libraries you need it to speak to.

We can load trees larger than the available memory. Or we can instantiate a classical OOP models from JSON, or completely transform your JSON while it is being read.

Is this page clear enough? Typo-free? Could you improve it?
