Do I Like This?

Opening the new MBP from the box always feels like early Christmas!!!

Seems like it isn’t elegant for Mac to add “Power” icon on the button. My intuitions helped me figure out the Right corner is a Power Button. Big Thx to Apple for making me think!

I used to rave about MagSafe and use that as a genius thought for people to convert from other so called laptops. I know for sure that’s gone for Apple’s own reasoning, “Green” charging light indicator is gone from the new USB-C cable. It is a good trade-off for generic purpose cable, but now you don’t have a clue whether it is charging or the wall adaptor is loose and fell down.

Or No Ports, Lot has been said and written.

Was the audio jack removed, you may ask. No is the rightful answer. However, it has moved from left to right, and Apple might be educating that it is the right angle to put your headjack.

Can’t comment, keyboard & mouse are not discoverable in the new MBP, the older MBP discovers it.

This is not a criticism, I don’t care about how Apple cools and heats their MBP, but they shouldn’t break what they already have.|||
