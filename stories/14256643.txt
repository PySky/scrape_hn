How do I use Ugnis? You use the visual editor to create the definition of your application. Once your app is ready, you can export a minified JavaScript code and put it in your website.

Can I build production apps with Ugnis right now? Please wait for the 1.0v release. You can be sure that exported code will work, but Ugnis Editor is changing rapidly and we might have to reset existing definitions. Right now we temporarily store a single definition in your browsers local storage. Do not rely on this feature.

Ugnis is declarative programming taken to the extreme. Declarative code is difficult to read and write, so we have created a visual editor to write declarative code for you. In development we use an interpreter for your definition but in production that would be pretty slow, so when exporting, Ugnis compiles your application to an optimized low-level JavaScript.

Can Ugnis create an app for Windows, Linux and Mac? We are planing to allow automatic wrapping with Electron but right now that would have to be done manually.

Not yet, though in the future a slightly changed editor with more specialized components will be able to export to iOS and Android.

But it already does. Ugnis did not start as a visual tool. It became one when we needed more than one dimension to express the cyclical nature of applications.|||
