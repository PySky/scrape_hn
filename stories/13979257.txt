"Visipedia: A System Composed of People and Machines for Collecting and Organizing Visual Information"

Pietro Perona, the Allen E. Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering, studies vision. He is interested in the engineering challenge of building machines that can see and in the scientific question on how brains compute useful information from images. At the moment his research group focuses on visual recognition and the visual perception of behavior. In collaboration with D. Anderson and M. Dickinson in the division of Biology he develops computer vision systems for measuring the behavior of laboratory animals. In the past his research has contributed to the theory of partial differential equations for image processing and boundary formation, and to modeling the early visual system’s function.



The Caltech Alumni Association held a day-long event to explore the ways in which computational thinking at Caltech is disrupting science and engineering, creating entirely new disciplines with "CS+X". From developing new paradigms for computation—quantum computing and DNA computing—to pushing the boundaries of machine learning and statistics in ways that transform fields like astronomy, chemistry, neuroscience, and biology, Caltech faculty are pioneering new disciplines at the interface of computer science, and science and engineering.
