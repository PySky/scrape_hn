Introducing a CMS for any HTML, Bootstrap or PHP template. You know the drill. You just want a few editable pages or elements on a page for clients to edit. They have a site already (or even if it's a new project) why go to the trouble of using a full-blown CMS with an awkward templating system that is easily hacked?

Why not just use a simple CMS that fits right into your HTML template from any web framework or any software export? Why not keep it simple and just give clients permissions to edit the bits they need? For those little projects when editing a few pages is enough, use Dropkick.|||
