Amelia was so excited that she did her own review of this kids bike. They really had a lot of fun riding this 3 wheel cruiser!



The Mobo Mity is a 3 wheeled bike, but it is rear wheel drive, so the handles turn the back wheels instead of a traditional tricycle that turns the front wheel.



From a dad's perspective, this is the best kids bike because:

- the kids had a blast riding this bike

- it's super easy to put together, 1 step assembly

- it gets the kids a lot of exercise



Amelia and Jacques like the Mobo Mity kids bike because:

- it's super fast

- it gives them exercise

- they like how the wheels turn



The Mobo Mity Cruiser can be used for kids ages 2-5, which makes it a great bike for toddlers, and the height capacity is 30" - 42". There are 4 settings on this tricycle, so your kids can grow with it. The seat is comfortable and it comes with a flag that acts as a safety flag since it sits so low to the ground.

LaneVids is a family of 4: Lane, Krista, Amelia & Jacques. Lane is the dad; Krista is the mom; Amelia is our daughter; and Jacques is our son. We believe that family who travel together and do things together helps to create stronger family bonds to keep families together. 



We like to do videos of travel, awesome road trips, fun birthday parties, tickling kids, holidays like Easter, Halloween, Christmas and New Years, we love being outside and going to outdoor playground and play areas, we love indoor playgrounds and children's museums and science museums, water parks, roller coasters, theme parks such as Six Flags, Silver Dollar City, and we hope to go to Disney. 



We love going to state parks, national parks, national monuments, eating at cool restaurants, visiting neat places, playing with water toys, water guns, Thomas the train, Paw Patrol, reading books, going to the beach, swimming pools, languages, playing outside, trying different food and snacks and candy from around the world, and so much more. We also love to talk about money and finance since we became debt-free using the Dave Ramsey Total Money Makeover. 



Be sure to watch our popular video such as How to Make Homemade Lava Lamp, How to Clean Your Dyson, How to Make Slime, Kids Science Experiments and How to Make Homemade Playdough.
