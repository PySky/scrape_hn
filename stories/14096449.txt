Much like it did with Translate, Google has been gradually incorporating its various services straight into search results for easy access – and the latest one to make the cut is its dedicated URL submission feature.

As spotted by Search Engine Land, the tech giant has updated Search to include an easy-to-access URL submission form at the top anytime you search for ‘Submit URL to Google.’

We’re not sure when the company added the feature, but the new addition essentially works exactly like the regular submission form – with the exception that it shows directly in search results now.

All you have to do to submit a link is fill in the blank space with the page you want to index and pass the ‘I’m not a robot’ reCAPTCHA safety measure.

The Big G will then review the page and see whether it wants to index the URL so other people can easily find it in their search results.
