We are pleased to announce the release of a new Swift source compatibility test suite as part of the effort to maintain source compatibility in future Swift releases.

The source compatibility test suite is community driven, meaning open source project owners can submit their projects for inclusion in the suite. Instructions for adding open source projects to the test suite can be found in the Swift Source Compatibility section on Swift.org.

Swift’s continuous integration system periodically builds projects included in the suite against development versions of Swift to catch source compatibility regressions as soon as possible.

Swift compiler developers can now use Swift’s pull request testing system to test their changes against the source compatibility test suite, helping catch source compatibility regressions before they are merged.

The goal is to have a strong source compatibility test suite containing thousands of projects. We look forward to project owners helping to achieve this goal by including their open source Swift projects in the test suite.|||
