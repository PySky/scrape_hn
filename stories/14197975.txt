As we see more customers move data warehousing workloads to Google BigQuery, patterns have emerged that will help others do their own successful migrations as rapidly as possible.

Our partner Pythian, which has extensive experience in facilitating such projects, has a clear view of these patterns as they continually emerge across different types of customer engagements. Helpfully, Pythian consultant and Certified GCP Qualified Developer Vladimir Stoyak has shared many of them via a new white paper, “A Framework For Migrating Your Data Warehouse to Google BigQuery.” As a teaser, to follow is a list of some of the top tips, courtesy of Vladimir, for the migration process:

Vladimir goes far beyond this high-level advice in the paper with in-detail suggestions and pro tips. He supports those details by documenting an example migration of a TPC-H-generated workload in Star Schema from AWS RedShift to BigQuery.
