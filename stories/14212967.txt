This prevents the write-ahead log directory from being confused as containing server activity logs, and erroneously truncated.

Rename functions, tools, and options that reference “xlog” to “wal” (Robert Haas) For example, becomes , pg_receivexlog becomes pg_receivewal, and becomes . This might require adjustments for prior-version scripts.

Allow and to return multiple rows when evaluating set-returning functions (Andres Freund). This also prevents conditionals like from controlling the execution of set-returning functions because set-returning functions are now executed earlier.

Have pg_basebackup stream the needed to restore the backup by default (Magnus Hagander) This changes the pg_basebackup / default to . An option value has been added to recreate the old behavior. The pg_basebackup option has been removed (use fetch).

Make all pg_ctl actions wait by default for completion (Peter Eisentraut) Previously some pg_ctl actions didn't wait for completion, and required the use of to do so.

Allow multi-dimensional arrays to be passed into PL/Python functions, and returned as nested Python lists (Alexey Grishchenko, Dave Cramer, Heikki Linnakangas) This makes a backwards-incompatible change to the handling of composite types in arrays. Previously, you could return an array of composite types as "[[col1, col2], [col1, col2]]", but now that is interpreted as a two- dimensional array. Composite types in arrays must now be returned as Python tuples, not lists, to resolve the ambiguity. I.e. "[(col1, col2), (col1, col2)]". See the documentation for more details. CLARIFY

Changing this from the default value caused queries referencing parent tables to not include children tables. The standard requires such behavior and this has been the default since Postgres 7.1.

This removes configure's option. Floating-point datetimes/timestamps have not been the default since Postgres 8.3 and have few advantages.|||
