Contributors to the php-docker image maintained by Google have recently added1 automagic building of the Phalcon extension (and others) and as of today have made the decision to include these packages as installed by default into the Docker image2 3.

If any of the packages listed here are extensions that you've been forced to build in your own docker image, you can now entirely ditch a custom docker image and include a file with you line in it to have it installed when you deploy your service.
