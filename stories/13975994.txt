We have uploaded Docker images for anyone who wants to try out building IncludeOS unikernels without having to install the development environment locally on their machines.

This will build a collection of useful Docker images:

If you have – or are developing – an IncludeOS service that you want to build in a Docker container, you can just go to the directory where you keep the service’s code, create and cd into a directory, and run the Docker container like this:

This will perform all the usual build steps, and generate finished IncludeOS images. If you need to make changes or fix bugs, just re-run the command.

If you do not have a hypervisor installed, you can run a very basic sanity test of your service by executing it inside QEMU in a Docker container:

On macOS, the option to add a GRUB bootloader is not available. Instead, you can use the Docker image. Build your service, followed by:

We are very interested in finding out that kind of workflows users would like to use Docker images for, so if you are doing something in the Docker/unikernel space, please get in touch, either here, in the IncludeOS issue tracker or on our Gitter chat!|||
