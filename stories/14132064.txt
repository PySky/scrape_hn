PyDuck is a Python Script which helps you to get your once written USB Rubber Ducky Payloads onto your Duck's SDCard quickly. You can even change variable components by using a simple command. All of this is made easy with a Metasploit like interface. Simply choose your payload with , configure it and there you go :)

You can get a list of all available commands by typing at any time.

You SDCard mounted on H:\ should now have the right inject.bin on its USB Stick ready to go :) (It should open notepad and type 'Hello Github')

Here is another demontration.

As you can see if the Payload bypasses UAC you can set the key for bypassing e.g for US its ALT + y for Germany it is ALT + j.

Each payload or module has its own folder in 'modules/'. Every module needs a module.json which is kind of a configuration file about its name, description, needed folders on the ducky, needed files and replacable attributes. Have a look at the existing modules and you should get the hang of it... at least i hope so...

If you want to have your Payload added feel free to make a pull request.|||
