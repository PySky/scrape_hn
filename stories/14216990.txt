Text obfuscation is not about changing "a" to "Ã " as it becomes reversible easily (like we see at obfuscator.uo1.net). Spellfucker's method uses random replacements which makes the reverting process more difficult. The cool thing is that the text still stays readable.

The goal of the project is to make text hard to read for computers yet fairly easy to read for humans (like bbboing, just differently).

For example, translate.google.com can not understand it.

This project is currently under active development and has an experimental status. Use at you own risk.

Please feel free to fork the GitHub repo.

You can also get Spellfucker at GitHub. Any interest, feedback or contribution is highly appreciated at any moment.|||

Yet another text obfuscator and the biggest enemy of the spellchecker
