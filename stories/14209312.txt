I just came home from watching “Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2”, which was a great, funny, action-packed movie that doesn’t disappoint. That is, until the scene where Kraglin, Yondu’s second-in-command in the Ravagers, hands Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star-Lord) a Microsoft Zune as a replacement for his broken Sony Walkman.

This looked like product placement meant to imply that the Zune was the cultural successor to the Walkman. But everyone knows that the Apple iPod was the true successor to the Walkman. I even heard murmurs in the audience asking what a Zune was, further highlighting the lack of the Zune’s cultural impact. Even if this was meant as a joke, it seems a bit too esoteric.

The introduction of the Zune further misses the whole point of the Walkman in the first place. Peter Quill left Earth in the 1980s and is a product of that generation. His Walkman was the only link to his lost home, Earth. As James Gunn, director of both Guardians movie says, “It’s one of the few things he has from Earth. I don’t think of it as a joke, because it’s very dear to him. It’s the umbilical cord that connects him to earth and the home and family he lost.”

I’m not against product placement, but if it has to be done, please… just please have it make sense in the context of the movie. Don’t ruin the storyline of an otherwise great movie with bad product placement.

Note: If you don’t know what product placement is, read this. Studios will often get permission from brand or product owners to use them prominently in a film. Sometimes they don’t, but without permission, they run the risk of law suits, especially if it’s considered to be negatively defaming to the brand or product.|||
