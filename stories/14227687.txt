We can always define mathematical concepts in multiple equivalent ways. The concept remains the same, but the definitions shine light on different parts of the underlying idea and leave other parts in the shadows¹.

The standard grade-school definition of prime numbers is a perfect example: it tells us very little about why 2 is a prime number but 1 isn’t. In fact, if I’m remembering my classes correctly, it was just declared by fiat: “a prime number is a number other than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself…”. But why that definition? Surely the same set but including 1 is just as well-defined? Why are we interested in including 2 but leaving 1 out?

There are good explanations, but they take a bit of thought and exposition on top of the definition. I’m going to try another tack: a definition of “prime number” that both shows (one reason) the concept is interesting and clearly demonstrates why 2 is inevitably prime and 1 isn’t.

I’m going to make the definition of “prime” implicit. Instead of starting with numbers and picking out the primes, I’ll start with the primes and build up the rest of the numbers.

But first, let’s cheat a bit: let’s talk about prime numbers without defining them first.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic tells us that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization; for example, [math]120 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5[/math]. Another way of thinking about it is that every positive integer is a bag² of prime numbers. In this scheme, multiplication is a union of bags; [math]12[/math] is [math]\{2, 2, 3\}[/math] and [math]10[/math] is [math]\{2, 5\}[/math] so [math]12 \times 10[/math] is [math]\{2, 2, 2, 3, 5\}[/math].

If what we care about is positive integers and multiplication—which is probably the case when we talk about prime numbers—this definition lays bare the skeleton of the structure. The prime numbers are the individual bones, and multiplication just combines the bones into larger bone structures. This definition shines light on the primes and leaves the nature of numbers in general (counting, arithmetic… etc) in shadow.

The really cool thing is that, from this perspective, we don’t need to know that prime numbers are numbers. Remember: the only operation here is combining multisets, and we can combine multisets without knowing anything about their elements (except for which elements are equal to one another). We could call [math]2, 3, 5\ldots[/math] [math]a, b, c\ldots[/math] and never define what [math]a \times b[/math] is or even have any symbol for 6, because our view of multiplication in terms of multisets gives it to us: [math]a \times b = \{a\} \cup \{b\} = \{a, b\}[/math]. We generate positive integers and multiplication from a set of labels, the labels are exactly the prime numbers, and it doesn’t matter what the labels—prime numbers—are.

This construction is isomorphic to the positive integers under multiplication. We can map every unique bag of primes (whatever primes are) to a unique integer, we can map every unique integer to a bag of primes and the operation of unioning two bags of primes is equivalent to the operation of multiplying two positive integers³.

Sticking with our [math]a, b, c\ldots[/math] theme, here are the first few correspondences:

This isn’t all of them (I’ll leave that list for another Quora answer), but hopefully you get the idea.

You’ll note that [math]1[/math] is the empty multiset. This is important and inevitable: [math]x \times 1 = 1 \times x = x[/math], and [math]\{\}[/math] is the multiset for which the same property holds under our union operation ([math]x \cup \{\} = \{\} \cup x = x[/math]). This property follows from the basic idea of our construction, which is to have [math]\times[/math]and [math]\cup[/math] behave in the same way; this sort of relationship between operations should be familiar if you’ve studied a bit of abstract algebra.

You’ll also note that all the prime integers correspond to multisets with exactly one element ([math]\{a\}[/math], [math]\{b\}[/math], [math]\{c\}[/math]… etc). This tells us that the arbitrary set of labels [math]\{a, b, c, d\ldots\}[/math] that we started out with becomes the set of primes in this construction, which is why we were motivated to start this way in the first place.

But semantically, we don’t have to know that. Instead, we can start by thinking of positive integers under multiplication as multisets generated from some countably infinite set of labels—and those labels are exactly the primes⁴! (I did say the definition of prime would be implicit!)

The cool thing here is that we simply can’t include [math]1[/math] in the primes. If we tried to (like, say, we started with [math]a[/math] corresponding to [math]1[/math] rather than [math]2[/math]), the bag with [math]a[/math] in it would be [math]\{a\}[/math]. The problem is that when we go to union [math]\{a\}[/math] with something (say [math]\{a, b\}[/math]) we don’t get the same thing back—we’d get [math]\{a, a, b\}[/math] instead of [math]\{a, b\}[/math]. No matter what we do, [math]\{a\}[/math] will never behave like [math]1[/math]; in this case, it actually behaves exactly like [math]2[/math]. No matter what we want, [math]1[/math] always has to correspond to the empty multiset [math]\{\}[/math], which is fundamentally different from the one-element multisets we’re identifying as primes in our model.

So there’s your answer: [math]2[/math] is a prime number because, when we look at building numbers from multisets, we need [math]2[/math] to make larger numbers and it only has one component itself. [math]1[/math] is not a prime number because it corresponds to the empty multiset, which it must in order to behave the same way under our multiplication operation.

¹ I borrowed this idea of shining light with different definitions from Barry Mazur’s wonderful article “When is one thing equal to some other thing?”, which I highly recommend reading.

² Bag is another word for “multiset”, a set that can contain duplicate elements. I actually like the word “multiset” more, except “bag of primes” produces a hilarious image. “Bag” is shorter too.

³ If you want to get a bit technical, we’ve built an isomorphism out of two monoid homomorphisms where one monoid is our bags under union and the other is positive integers under multiplication. In fact, I got the whole idea for this answer from a cryptic note on the Wikipedia article for free monoids:

If you don’t understand this, don’t worry about it. It’s a fun note, but too much to explain in this Quora answer—and completely unneeded to understand everything else.

⁴ To be extra precise: we identify each label from our set of labels [math]\{a, b, c, d\ldots\}[/math] with the single-element bag containing that label ([math]\{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{d\}\ldots\}[/math]. I hope the relationship between the two is clear.|||
