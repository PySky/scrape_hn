hey is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.

hey was originally called boom and was influenced from Tarek Ziade's tool at tarekziade/boom. Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases where binary name conflicts created confusion. To preserve the name for its original owner, we renamed this project to hey.

hey runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level and prints stats.|||

hey - HTTP load generator, ApacheBench (ab) replacement, formerly known as rakyll/boom
