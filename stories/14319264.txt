We appreciate all your comments and votes on this issue.

We agree: Keeping your messages in sync as you move from device to device is critical functionality. When HipChat was originally built, there was only a single client – the desktop AIR app. And HipChat never stored any information about the messages you read. Since then, we've not only grown our service, but added separate apps across Mac, Windows, Linux, Web, iOS and Android. We all have come to expect much more from HipChat.

So rest assured: Our ultimate goal is to make sure you never miss a message again as you move between devices (or come back from lunch!).

Retrofitting such fundamental functionality into the system requires extreme care, especially given our increased focus and attention on stability. Reading messages is a very high frequency event.

We welcome you to continue to leave your feedback and concerns here, and we'd also like to invite you to take the next step in helping us envision the future for HipChat.
