Skepticism is good for science, but it is only useful when one understands the theories they are skeptical about. If one doesn't understand established models, then simply rejecting these theories out of personal preference is pointless. One has to understand the current model very well, point out some deficiency, and offer an improvement/correction that gives a quantifiable improvement in its predictive capability (which can then be measured and verified). There is a false view that those who make scientific breakthroughs outright reject the academy filled with its stuffy old academics and blaze new trails all on their own. I know you don't think this, but it is a commonly portrayed scenario. The truth is that all scientific theories build on the work of previous scholars and theories. For example, GR was an extension/modification to Newton's theory of universal gravitation, not a complete negation. 

 

 In short, science is collective human activity in which we build on the work of others. No crank has ever made an improvement to science because they don't understand scientific theories in the first place and therefore aren't in a position to build on anything.|||
