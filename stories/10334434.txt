Ballista is a project to explore inter-website and web/native communication; specifically, communication between one website and another site or native app of the user's choosing. We want the user to be able to share or edit documents in another website or app that the first website has never even heard of, choose documents from another website, or register a website as a native file handler. We're attempting to solve similar problems to the intents system on Android, but also address other use cases like document editing. Essentially, we want to create an interoperability system for the web.

Our explainer document dives deeper into the problem space and outlines an API that we think solves this problem. But this is less about proposing an API, and more about starting a conversation, so take a look, and let us know what you think (contact details below).

We have a prototype that works in Chrome and Firefox. Try this:

These two apps don't know about each other, yet the editor can edit files from the cloud app. Using our polyfill, you can write a web app that interoperates with our demo apps in the same way.

You can view and manage app registrations at chromium-ballista.appspot.com. In the final product, the registration, picking and management UI would be part of the browser.

See the file in each directory for details. Many caveats apply.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
