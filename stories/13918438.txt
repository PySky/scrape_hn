LibJIT is a library that provides generic Just-In-Time compiler functionality independent of any particular bytecode, language, or runtime. It started off as a part of the DotGNU project and was used as the backend for DotGNU Portable.NET JIT engine. Since then it has been used in a number of other projects not related to DotGNU and became a separate project on its own right.

The last released version of LibJIT was 0.1.2. This version is severely out of date and its use is discouraged. Currenly it is preferable to use the source code from the LibJIT Savannah repository.

The LibJIT documentation can be read on-line. If you have LibJIT on your system, you may also find the documentation locally in the info format.

The new LibJIT mailing list is libjit@gnu.org (archives and subscription).

The old DotGNU libjit mailing list is dotgnu-libjit@gnu.org (archives).|||
