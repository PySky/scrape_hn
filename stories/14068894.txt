The goal of the SSL Labs surveys is to measure the effective security of SSL. After some experimentation with an assessment of substantially all public SSL sites (about 1.5 million of them), we settled on a smaller list of about 200,000 SSL-enabled web sites, based on Alexa’s list of most popular sites in the world. Working with a smaller list is more manageable and allows us to conduct the surveys more often. It also allows us to conduct more thorough analysis to look for application-layer issues that may subvert SSL security. In addition, focusing on popular sites – we believe – gives us more relevant results and also excludes abandoned sites.

Having worked with several data sets, each drawing from a different list of sites, we have come to understand that what we are presenting in our surveys is not a measurement, but a reasonable approximation of the state of SSL. More important than the results from any one round of tests is how the measurements change over time. The adoption of a single selection methodology and a switch to monthly testing should give us an indicator of where we’re heading, which is what we believe matters.|||
