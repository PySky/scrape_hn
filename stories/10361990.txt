Content blocking on iOS has become a popular pursuit since Apple added support for the controversial, albeit useful, feature in iOS 9. AdBlockX is a new application that unlocks the power of content blocking for a small fee.

You can download AdBlockX for $0.99, and it’s optimized for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Of course, it requires iOS 9.0 or above, and the app is fully optimized for Apple’s larger iPhone handsets (including the recently released 6s and 6s Plus). But, for those unfamiliar with content blockers, what exactly does AdBlockX do?

Well, once enabled, AdBlockX allows iOS device owners to block out Web ads and trackers when surfing in Apple’s Safari for iOS. This not only results in a nicer, more refined, more enjoyable browsing experience, but it also saves on battery consumption while protecting user data, at the same time.

AdBlockX is another app in a fairly long, growing line of content blockers for iOS 9. But that doesn’t mean it should be ignored. AdBlockX is simple to use, it works effortlessly, and it offers the same functionality many competing applications do. As such, price, availability, and the fact AdBlockX isn’t (yet) allowing publishers to pay to be whitelisted could put this application ahead of a piece of rival software.

So, for anyone looking to block out Web ads (and trackers) on their iOS device, AdBlockX is available for just $0.99. As mentioned, it’s optimized for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.|||
