curaga: thanks for the tip. tce-load -wi scsi-KERNEL does indeed get hv_storvsc loadedHowever, I now get the same hanging behaviour which I get with tinycore 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2.The symptom is that when I write a certain amount of data (I guess an amount large enough so that the journal then flushes to disk - I'm using ext4), the process which is requesting the write hangs. The kernel is still running, and new processes can be started, but kill -9 does not kill the process which is hanging.It appears that the problem is known for 7.2 ( http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php?topic=20449.0 ), and as you pointed out the problem reported in this post is not just due to a missing module - it's a HyperV/Kernel/both bug.6.4.1 works fine, FYI.I tried recompiling the 7.2 kernel, and got similar results.Any suggestions on what the root cause might be / how to fix?|||
