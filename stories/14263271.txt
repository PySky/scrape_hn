May 3, 2017 On May 1, 2017, NyaaTorrents officially ceased operations. At time of this writing, nothing remains of the site. These are actions taken by the owner of the site and not a result of some form of internal subversion or engagement by government or legal entities. The exact reasons for shutdown remain a mystery to all but the anonymous owner, but remaining former NT associates are led to believe that based on the circumstances surrounding closure, it was in response to recent court rulings that had the potential to affect site operations in the future. Rather than face this possibility, and any repercussions it would have on all parties involved, the owner decided to bring everything to a complete end. Based on operating principles, nothing will remain of the original site and all content, to include back-end, front-end, and all databases, has likely been purged. There are no plans to continue any activity under the NyaaTorrents banner. Any projects that occur from here on out are not associated with the original site. The above serves as an official statement by what remains of the site. Further questions can be directed via IRC to those remaining in #NyaaTorrents on irc.rizon.net. - The (former) NyaaTorrents moderation staff|||
