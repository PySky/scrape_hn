To get started, first of all download WordPress from their official website WordPress.org or just go on Google Search engine and search for WordPress, there you will get link of WordPress download page. Which is as Following.

From this page, you will get the latest version of WordPress in Zip compressed file format.

To get WordPress on your localhost you have to extract this Zip file in your Project folder.

Extract your WordPress zip file there, give the folder name whatever the name you want to give to your project.

To get started with your WordPress installation, you have to create empty database for it. To do so,

In phpMyAdmin page of your localhost, you will find a option to create New Database. Create Database with the name whatever you see fit for it and you are done with it.

After you done creating Database, the next thing to do is, to access your project through the browser.

To do so, You have to enter name of the project you set as your Folder Name in the URL after “Localhost/”

For Ex. Your directory name is “firstweb”

As you will get access in your Project Directory, WordPress will ask you to select language in which you want to see your Admin Panel.

So, Mostly it is English, Just Press continue after selecting your languauge.

The Next thing WordPress will show you is, Welcome message and a message to inform you to be ready with information as it requires ahead.

Which are Database Name, Database Username, Database Password and Database Host. Click on the Let’s Go Button.

In the next frame you will get form to fill with the details you were informed to be ready with.

First Database Name, Enter the name of the database which you created in PhpMyAdmin.

Second Username, This will be your Database Username, which is “root” by default, if you have changed it enter the one you kept.

Third Password, This will be your Database Password, which is blank means just leave that field empty if you haven’t changed it.

Database Host, enter Localhost as the database host if you are installing it in localhost, for web host, you have to enter domain name or IP address of your web host.

For ex. If it is to setup for our website it will be Suratnow.com

Table pre-fix doesn’t need to be changed, you can leave it as it is. But if you are using multiple WordPress project on single database, you have to set different pre-fix from other WordPress Project.

In the very next frame, you will get the Run the installation button. Just do it and you are all done combining WordPress with Database.

As your installation is on the last stage, you will get the form to create your user. You have to create at least one user as administrator of the website.

Enter Username, this will be an Administrator user of your WordPress project. Enter password whatever you want to set. They will suggest an auto-generated password, which will be hard to remember, so set password of your liking, and if it shows you weak password, just check the confirm use of weak password check box below it.

There is a Email input box in that form, in case if you forget your password, you can retrieve your password from that Email.

That’s it, you will get login page next, just login with the Username and password you set in previous procedure, you will be redirected to the dashboard page of your WordPress project.
