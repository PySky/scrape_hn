BesselLoadingView is a Bezier curve effect of the loading transition animation. Customize views with canvas.

 BesselLoadingView是一个贝塞尔曲线效果的加载过渡动画。使用canvas绘制的自定义view。

The layout of the effect is this. (上图效果的layout是这样的.)

First we provide three configurable options, color, animation cycle length, radius of the circle (the radius will change according to the size of the set)

 首先我们提供三个可配置选项,分别是颜色,动画周期时长,圆的半径(半径同时会根据设置的大小变化)

As with the general custom View, we get several custom properties in the constructor

 与一般自定义View一样,我们在构造方法中获取自定义的几个属性,

Construct the method which we only initialize some of the necessary configuration parameters, but our distance between the circle and the distance ah what is not initialized, we are in the initialization onMeasure some size parameters

I have done such as the configuration of the radius than the actual height of the upper and lower even under the circumstances automatically reduced ah, and a series of adaptive operation. And the default

The next focus comes, we need to draw a few things, three fixed circles, a floating circle, Bezier curve, fixed circle radius change.

When drawing a Bezier curve, it is necessary to calculate the fixed circle nearest to the fixed circle, and then draw the nearest Bezier curve of the circle, and then calculate the distance to calculate how much the circle should change.

** Now， our custom View is done , if helpful, welcome star ** (至此，我们的自定义View便OK了， 若有帮助，欢迎star)|||
