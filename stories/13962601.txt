UPDATE The latest fw version 205-600055 does not fix the WiFi dissassociation vulnerability in the Dropcam Pro. If the supplied WiFi network does not exist, reassociation time was improved and now connects back within approximately 10 seconds. However, a valid WiFi network can still be provided to take the dropcam offline permanently.

Summary

 It's possible to trigger a buffer overflow condition when setting the SSID parameter on the camera. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup. Details

 The payload attempts to set an SSID with a length of 1 byte and sends 16.

 SequenceNum=3a + Type=0312 + Length=01 + Value=AA*16



Summary

 It's possible to trigger a buffer overflow condition when setting the encrypted password parameter on the camera. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup. Details

 The payload attempts to set the encrypted wifi password with a length of 1 byte and sends 3.

 SequenceNum=3a + Type=0312 + Length=0b + ssidVal=506574536d6172742d356e + type=1a + length=01 + encPass=AA*3



Summary

 It's possible to disconnect the camera from Wifi by supplying it a new SSID to connect to. Local storage of video footage is not supported by these cameras so surveillance is temporarily disabled. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup. Details

 The payload attempts to change Nest Cam's associated SSID causing temporary disassociation from the current Wifi SSID. seqNum + 0312(type) 0b(len) + SSID + 1a(type) 20(len) + encPass seqNum + encPass(cont) seqNum + encPass(cont) + 2002280032(constant) + 10(len) + authTag seqNum + authTag(cont) + 3a(UnknownType) 04(len) + DEADBEEF seqNum(execute) Result

 Camera dissociates from current wifi network to attempt association with newly set SSID. If the WiFi network does not exist, the camera will go offline for approximately 60-90 seconds before returning to the original Wifi network and resuming normal operation. If the network does exist, it will check for Internet connectivity and remain on the new network.
