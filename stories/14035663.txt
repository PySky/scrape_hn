The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is “actively reconsider[ing] whether to revise …” the regulation that allows certain H-4 spouses to apply for employment authorization documents (EADs). This news comes via a DHS court filing, which asks the court to suspend any action on the pending lawsuit regarding the H-4 EAD program to allow the DHS additional time “to reconsider the [H-4 EAD rule] and whether issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to it is appropriate.”

Although no details are provided with regard to what changes may be proposed, this certainly is cause for alarm for the thousands of H-4 spouses who rely on this program to be able to work in the United States.
