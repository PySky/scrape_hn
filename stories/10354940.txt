From “A Page from a California Almanac.” Samuel Clemens signed his first newspaper article “Mark Twain” in 1863, publishing two years later this light piece and “Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog”—the latter bringing him national recognition. Around the same time he observed that he had a “‘call’ to literature of a low order—i.e., humorous.” Twain published Innocents Abroad in 1869, Tom Sawyer in 1876, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1885.|||
