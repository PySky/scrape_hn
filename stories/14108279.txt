Microsoft is holding an event in New York on May 2. We're expecting a mix of hardware and software news, but perhaps not the hardware or software news that some people will be expecting.

According to sources familiar with the matter, we won't be seeing a Surface Phone, which is no surprise to anyone no matter how much certain Windows die-hards want Microsoft to release such a thing. But what may come as a shock is that we're hearing we won't see a Surface Pro 5 at the event either. The Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book are both in dire need of a hardware refresh, and an upgrade is more than a little overdue at this point but... May 2 is not the day.

Microsoft is using the hashtag "MicrosoftEDU" to promote the event, which allows us to connect a few dots. Microsoft's Joe Belfiore has recently returned to the company after an extended sabbatical during which he travelled the world and tried a number of experimental hairstyles, and his new role includes acting as "education sponsor and advocate."

The company is also believed to be working on Windows 10 Cloud, a new Windows 10 SKU that is locked down and restricted to only running apps from the Windows Store. Such a Windows version is obviously competing with Google's Chrome OS, which is making big strides in education markets thanks to, among other things, its locked-down environment and affordable hardware.

Putting these together, we'd expect to see the official launch of Windows 10 Cloud, along with a system to run it on—perhaps something along the lines of a Surface 4, or a pure laptop iteration of Surface Book. Generally, expect a concerted effort from Microsoft to go after education markets.

Whatever Microsoft has to announce, we'll be live on the scene.|||

The event will be education focused, with hardware and software news.
