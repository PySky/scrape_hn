This server comes with a sample index.html that shows when you send a GET request to the server, it responds with a new map in kind. This allows you to fully decouple the dungeon generation into a microservice, so that the game can be written in any language that can send HTTP requests and read JSON. Thus, the responsibility for (at least, the initial) dungeon generation itself is offloaded completely.

Should you send a GET request to the server, you will receive JSON data. Read the API documentation on apiary for endpoint information with examples.

The API server runs on Node.js, and has been engineered to be a microservice and run in the cloud. The easiest way to get your own server up and running is to deploy with heroku (which is of no cost to you), that way, you dont need to setup your own server or install nodejs.

To run on your own system, you need Node.js v7.x installed. From there, you can run your own version by cloning this repo, then running npm install/start.

Your server should then be running on localhost:8080, from which you can use the REST API end points.

When the server is running, you can navigate to the root url to see a very basic example of API usage.

There is an example server running on heroku right now, if you would like to give it a test drive. That being said, I highly recommend you check out the documentation on apiary, as it includes live examples and hits the same server endpoints, anyway.

This would not be possible without the hard work and tireless efforts from the contributors/authors of the following projects:|||
