This week Microsoft released the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit version 2.0 out of beta. The toolkit, previously known as CNTK, is a free, easy-to-use, open source, commercial-grade toolkit that trains deep learning algorithms to learn like the human brain.

“Cognitive Toolkit is being used extensively by a wide variety of Microsoft products, by companies worldwide with a need to deploy deep learning at scale, and by students interested in the very latest algorithms and techniques,” wrote Chris Basoglu, Partner Engineering Manager in the AI & Research group at Microsoft.  “The latest version of the toolkit is available on GitHub via an open source license. Since releasing the beta in October 2016, more than 10 beta releases have been deployed with hundreds of new features, performance improvements and fixes.”
