In today’s software landscape, we’re no longer limited to feelings of inadequacy from just perusing Dribbble. Now we can feel insecure because we’ve never created a design system even half as robust as the ones above.

But just like watching Lebron play basketball or Thom Yorke orchestrating a song, it’s important to remember that most of us simply aren’t equipped to pull that off. So rather than hanging just up our shoes and guitar (or whatever Radiohead plays on these days), we can look toward these best-in-class systems for inspiration, and t0 understand what the path to success looks like.

Nathan Curtis said that design systems should be treated like a product. In this light, you can see how systems have a well-defined growth path from fledgling startup to monolithic corporation on the NYSE. Design systems don’t have to be huge. And they rarely are.

Using product as a reference makes it easier to understand how to construct your own design system.

Avoid pedantic debates on what defines a design system. Instead, define the goals of your system, its target audience, and your MVP. This will help you make more effective decisions as to where you should direct your effort. More importantly, you won’t be paralyzed with where to begin.|||
