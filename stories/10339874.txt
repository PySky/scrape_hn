Emotes are completely cosmetic and don’t influence gameplay in any way. Collector Edition of Destiny: The Taken King had 3 exclusive emotes, which were not available in the main game. You could actually buy this exclusive content for $20. It hasn’t been yet revealed how much will the players pay for the additional emotes. However we do know that Bungie is giving out some free Silver to all Destiny players for them to purchase some new emotes.

Does this mean, that Activision is thinking of making Destiny a completely free to play experience? It’s probably too late to judge, but there’s always this chance. After all, Activision sees the numbers of Hearthstone and other F2P games made by Blizzard and they must understand the commercial potential of this monetization model.

Further heating our suggestions are the new rumors from Kotaku. Citing anonymous sources “familiar with Destiny’s development,” Kotaku says that Activision wants to change its entire pricing for the additional content. All the DLC for Destiny may become free for download. Updates will be released every month until the release of the first official sequel Destiny 2.|||

Activision is changing the way it is going to earn money with Bungie's most recent shooter. The company is introducing microtransactions and thinks of changing its paid DLC policy.
