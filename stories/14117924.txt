I'm challenging myself to be healthier and inventing a device to remind and encourage me to achieve my goals!

Over the last week I focused on logo design for the iOS app, and for the website. I had a lot of fun browsing Dribbble for inspiration and art direction. I made around 21 variations, which one is your favorite?

These files are now on github in the design folder!

In addition to updating rect-native (which took hours), I added some new features and refactors.|||
