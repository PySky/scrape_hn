My name is Roland Kossow - I am working since about 20 years in IT and am almost as long part of the Delphi Community. I have seen Delphi being sold from Borland to embarcadero and am now seeing it being sold with embarcadero to Idera. My development company CyberTribe is betting on Delphi and its component ecosystem as strategic toolset. So it is important that Delphi stays plattformindependent and its current owner remains as focused as embarcadero on its improvement. The best idea to insure that might be that the community is taking over itself. Knowing that it is a community of individuals and companies with partly pretty much financial power, it might even be possible to establish a development and maintenance organisation. This site tries to find out, if the budget would fit. What do you think?

Thanks a lot for your willingness to buy Delphi (C++/RAD Studio) with me. We will see if we can make a competitive offer !!!

You will receive a quarterly update on the proceedings of this endeavour. If you should change your attitude and want to pay less or more for Delphi just fill out the survey again. Your last completion of the survey will be taken - as long as you use the same email address.|||
