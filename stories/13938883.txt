A Node.js package for invoking divine blessings for one's Javascript code.

is the Hindi word for blessings/good wishes. More than the meaning, I like the sound of it; it's cute. It's a loanword from Arabic, where the word has a rather different meaning.

For your code to run successfully, of course! Do note that this doesn't mean dua WILL run your code, no matter how buggy it is; it just means a lot of good wishes and blessings are being directed towards your code. Ultimately, karma does count.

Well...yes. But honestly, it's not a lot. Believe me, it's better than React's dependency list! And again, why not add an extra dependency that puts in a harmless, useful blessing here and there? Not gonna hurt!

Next, you need to include dua in every single module. Every single module. Blessings don't work when you solicit them half-heartedly.

That's it! When you need a blessing before running a piece of code that's particularly troublesome:

Every blessing comes with a unique ID, and you can even go ahead and log all your blessings. Remember, accumulated blessings are a blessing!

Yeah, but blessings are universal. Ports for Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Swift and F# are on their way :)
