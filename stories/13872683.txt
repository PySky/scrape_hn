Webpack 2.2 RC includes support for Performance Budgets  — a new feature that will help warn (or optionally error) when the size of your JavaScript bundles may be large enough to impact your user experience. The feature is completely configurable, and we hope it will help you ship faster sites 🚕💨

Larger bundles of script can exhibit a few interesting characteristics:

When we profiled a few thousand production sites using Webpack 1, we noticed quite a few folks were shipping down monolithic JavaScript bundles between 1–3MB in size (gzipped). This led to unexpectedly slow load times and many sites took up to 20s before they were interactive ⏳

Performance Budgets should help us all get a little more thoughtful with how we much JS we load. This will hopefully lead to faster sites 👍

We care enough about this problem that we’ve made the feature an opt-out. We know it will mean one more thing we all need to keep an eye on, but in the grander scheme of things, if it results in your users getting a happier, faster loading experience, then it’s a win 🏅

By default, Webpack prescribes some default performance budgets (for entry points and assets). These defaults are based on studies we’ve done into budgets that ultimately lead to a quick loading experience on both cable and 3G.

If, however, you’d like to tweak these defaults, then you can customize the maxAssetSize, maxEntryPointSize or hints (false, ‘warning’ or ‘error’) using a entry in your Webpack config:|||
