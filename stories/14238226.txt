Recently, Burger King took out a TV advert and used Google voice assistant's "OK google" command to make devices read out a paragraph on the whopper burger. While most news reports take a rather cavalier attitude, treating it as a prank, this is actually remote command execution. The attacker is able to remotely force a device to execute a command. This is no different from a SQL injection where an attacker is able to cause SQL commands to be executed. Although this is not remote code execution, the attacker actually does not need arbitrary code, the built-in commands are good enough to cause quite a bit of mischief.
