A form backend for static sites. Formplug is built using the Serverless Framework and runs on AWS Lambda. It uses API Gateway for routes and SES to send emails.

Set the form action to your Formplug endpoint and responses will be forwarded on to the specified email address. The email address can be plain text as shown below or hidden behind an encrypted hexedecimal string (see next section).

The email address can be encyrpted so it's not visible in the request or HTML page source. It's encrypted and decrypted using the encryption key in config.json. If this key is changed then the email's encrypted string will also change.

Append _format=json to the query string of the Formplug URL to get responses back in JSON with a CORS allow all origin header. This makes it easy to interact with Formplug using Javascript.

You can optionally add custom messages to config.json to override the default user messages for encrypt and receive http requests.|||
