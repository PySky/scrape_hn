In this post I want to show you how to create new database using Entity Framework Core â€“ Code First migrations approach.

I have project ELP.Model in which I defined few entities. I want to create database from it. It is approach called Code First. This is how looks one of my entity

To be able to enable migration and create database, we need to create Context. My Context Class looks like this

We need to install few packages before we start with actual migration.

To do it, open Package Manager Console (In VS Tools-> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console) set Default Project to your target project and install packages. Make sure to install the newest versions or the same versions for all.

To enable migrations in our project first we need to type in the same console Add-Migration MigrationName

and here is surprise. Not so easy man. I missed something. Yes exactly, we need to add implementation of IDbContextFactory<ELPContext>

What daâ€¦ !? It looks like it is an issue in EF Core v 1.1.0. Work aroundÂ for it is to change version to 1.0 :/ To do it we need to modify TargetFramework in csproj file from netcoreapp1.1 to netcoreapp1.0

Yeah, we have created database, nice. Now we can add something to it ðŸ™‚|||
