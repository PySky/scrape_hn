The encoder allows you to encode your own wepage into a URL. 

 Anything that can be displayed by a web browser can be encoded.

A: 4QR.xyz was originally created by Alexander Reben to encode digital artworks into QR codes. 

 QR codes with an embedded URL will directly open in a browser when read. 

 So a website was created to render the data contained in a URL into a browser. 

 This allows all the data needed to make a webpage to be rendered without that webpage hosted on a server. 

 It became apparent that the tool itself could be used to create and share small creative web applications 

(as well as any other code that a browser can display) is a non centralized way. 

The data can be stored in QR codes, link shorteners, NFC cards or the blockchain.

A: This varies by browsers and platforms, but URLs with up to 9999 total characters have been tested as working in desktop chrome.

A: Everything in the site is trimmed down and optimized for bandwidth (at least that's the excuse).

A: Check out the reference page or the GitHub page.

A: No, all code is run locally in the browser of the person who clicked the link.

A: No, since there is no storage of the link, it only exists where it is shared.
