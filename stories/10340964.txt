icrosoft has finally done the one thing everybody wanted and Apple feared. It created its first ever laptop. This is a 13.5-inch machine with a 267PPI and I repeat – it’s the first ever laptop made by Microsoft.

Microsoft introduced the Surface Book as the Surface with a bigger screen and “the perfect typing experience” and the “thinnest and most powerful PC ever created.”

The Surface Book comes with a backlit keyboard and Microsoft is calling it the perfect laptop. It features the latest Intel Core processors and it’s powered by the powerful Nvidia GeForce GPU with GDDR5 memory.
