How does TripMode save my mobile data? When TripMode is ON, it prevents all your apps from accessing the Internet but those that have been whitelisted by yourself. It typically stops automatic updates, online backups, Photos syncs, and various obscure apps from consuming precious data. Both uploads and downloads are blocked.

Can I use TripMode with any Wi-Fi or 3G/4G dongle? Yes. Just turn TripMode ON from the topbar. TripMode should activate itself each time your Mac connects to that network.

Why isn't TripMode on the Mac App Store? TripMode uses an OS X feature called “Kernel Extension” to be able to block apps from accessing the Internet. This is the Apple-endorsed way of managing network traffic on a Mac. However, Apple’s Mac App Store Guidelines currently don’t allow apps with Kernel Extensions. That’s why we are distributing it outside of the Mac App Store. Rest assured that your system and payments are safe with us. We have thoroughly tested the app and are working with a state of the art payment solutions provider ( Paddle ). Are you tracking my surf data? No. We log apps traffic volumes to better optimize the solution and that’s it. Information about what type of sites you visit, what content you transfer, etc. is never logged. We take privacy seriously.|||
