S9fES is a mature, portable, and comprehensible interpreter for R4RS Scheme. The core interpreter is written in pure ANSI C (C89), so it runs on all platforms offering a C compiler. It can even be compiled natively on Plan 9. On Unix-based systems (or MinGW), it also offers an interface to common Unix system calls and Curses routines.

The interpreter is built around the S9 Core toolkit (PDF), which contains some basic building blocks for dynamic languages, such as a garbage collected heap, bignum arithmetics, etc. (The toolkit is included in the S9fES tarball).

S9fES has been developed using EDOC, a literate programming tool. The rendered EDOC source code to a previous version is available in print and PDF form. The C and Scheme code stripped from the EDOC files is in the public domain, though, and can be downloaded here (~600KB).

The interpreter is explained in detail in the SchemeÂ 9 Book!|||
