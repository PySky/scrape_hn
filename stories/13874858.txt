Build layout through ASCII art in Sass (and more).

HTML never requires any additional classes, wrappers, etc.

Don't lose count of your s! Freely combine with your ASCII art.

As basic as it gets.

Just tell Grassy to distribute dangling elements.

Or distribute them at the top if you prefer it that way.

Also take a look at full documentation. (Includes both the public API and explanation of some internal functions to help you if you want to contribute but have no idea where to start from.)

Try it out now in the Codepen playground.

NOTE This is still in rapid development phase. There might be breaking changes along the way. For this reason, I advise you not to use this in serious projects. However, to find (and fix) bugs, people have to use it somewhere. So if you have a suitable non-critical project, it would be awesome if you could try out Grassy.

Please report bugs and suggest ideas by opening an issue.

Grassy is heavily inspired by Effortless Style, a talk by Heydon Pickering.|||
