In the JS library detection announcement Tuesday, I used jQuery as an example of the powerful queries you can run to answer complex questions about the web.

And a really great discussion followed about why this particular version is so popular. As it turns out, 1.x versions are compatible with older browsers and still actively* maintained. 1.12.4's popularity is aided by the fact that it is the default version in WordPress.

* The jQuery release history on Wikipedia shows that 1.12.4 was last updated on May 20, 2016.

So that got me thinking. If we take the release data from Wikipedia and join it with the version data on HTTP Archive, we could better understand not only what the most popular versions are, but how old.

I wrote this script to extract the data into a succinct format to be used by BigQuery. Here's the full extraction:

Then I wrote a User-Defined Function (UDF) in BigQuery that basically just lets me use JSON data as if it were a table. (Let me know if there's an easier way!). I reference this UDF and join it with the JS library popularity data to get a list of weighted ages for each version. If a particular version does not have a release (or last modified) date, then it falls back to the date of its minor version.

See it on BigQuery.

The results of the inner query show the breakdown of versions and ages:



Then the outer query averages it all up to get the final answer: 1214 days, or about 3.3 years!|||
