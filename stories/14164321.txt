 Nowadays, the most common technique to bypass application whitelisting is to start PowerShell, because the target code can be passed inside arguments, it has full access to the Windows API, it is a signed binary from Microsoft and it can be found on all newer systems. However, it’s the first binary which gets removed from the whitelist by administrators, PowerShell v5 provides very good logging (attack detection and forensic), Device Guard UMCI (user mode code integrity) places PowerShell in Constrained Language mode and Antivirus solutions monitor malicious invocations of PowerShell. 

 

 Nearly similar PowerShell advantages can be achieved by abusing node.js from NVIDIA if the target system has these drivers installed. It can be started in interactive mode which means that scripts can be passed via pipe (payloads are not written to disk). For example, the following command starts the calculator via node.js: 

 





 

 This trick is already known and was described by James Forshaw on a different subject (unfortunately, I didn’t found the original post from him on it but in general all his posts are highly recommended). 

 

 What does that mean? Even if an administrator added additional exclude rules to the default rules to block writeable folders, we can still bypass AppLocker with the ADS. 

 

 The following figure shows this (AppLocker is configured to prevent C:\Windows\tracing\* and several other writeable locations):



 

 Here Microsoft's control.exe is used to load the library, however, it can also be loaded via node js (and using the fs-module it's possible to create the ADS). 

 

 Another possibility is to overwrite an existing library if application whitelisting was configured only based on paths (because of updates). 

 

 Here are some additional methods which I tried to avoide the file write at all: 

 

 Some methods which I tried for in-memory files



 UNC paths: 

 

 

 The code first tries to load the addon via SMB (port 445) and use WebDav (port 80) as fall-back. Since outgoing SMB traffic is in most environments forbidden, it would be good to directly access the data via WebDav (and it’s possible to create a WebDav server in JavaScript with node.js, but then firewall problems can occur). This is possible via paths such as the following two: 

 

 

 

 A good explanation why these paths work can be found at [8]. 

 

 However, both path formats are not allowed inside node.js (the code later calls lstat which throws a file not found exception). Moreover, Microsoft internally writes the file to %localappdata%, making the approach useless to achieve file-less exploitation. 

 

 Another idea was to abuse named pipes which can be created with node.js code, however, named pipes are not seekable and therefore LoadLibrary() / require() fail. 

 

 Calling CreateFile with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY and FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE creates in most cases an in-memory file, however, node.js does not provide a way to pass these flags inside JavaScript code. 

 

 For people wondering why NVIDIA ships with node.js 

 At startup, NVIDIA starts a webserver via node.js (providing functionality like the above mentioned webcam control) on a randomized port. To protect against attacks a random secret cookie is created and must be passed to interact with the service. The information about the used port number and cookie value can be extracted from the following file:
