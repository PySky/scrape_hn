There are about 90 million knowledge workers in the US who schedule approximately 10 billion meetings every year. We have spent the last 20-some-odd years playing email ping pong to set up our meetings, and in doing so we’ve been taking valuable time away from what we’re actually hired to do. It would be devastating to imagine us spending the next 20 years doing the same thing.

Some solutions have offered to alleviate this pain, but the only way to truly escape it is through an agent setting where you can hand off this task to be completed in full, by either a human or an AI agent.

A human assistant is expensive, and most of us can only dream of having one for meeting scheduling. If we imagine a future in which everybody has an agent to schedule their meetings, I think we can quickly agree that this can only happen if the process is driven by AI. Which is to say, AI makes the democratization of the personal assistant possible.

Positive network effects make it likely that a single AI agent will dominate. And if this holds true, then when two people use an AI assistant to schedule a meeting, the AI agent is effectively talking to herself. We like to call this “scheduling nirvana” because we’re geeks. If our single agent vision holds and “scheduling nirvana” abounds, then we’ll see a true paradigm shift. Scheduling meetings will conceptually disappear as a task, and eventually negotiating a time for your own meeting will be as eccentric as mailing someone a letter to setup a time to meet :-)
