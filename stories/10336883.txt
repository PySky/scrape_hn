Cloud Security Scanner is a web security scanner for common vulnerabilities in Google App Engine applications. It can automatically scan and detect four common vulnerabilities, including cross-site-scripting (XSS), Flash injection, mixed content (HTTP in HTTPS), and outdated/insecure libraries. It enables early identification and delivers very low false positive rates. You can easily setup, run, schedule, and manage security scans and it is free for Google Cloud Platform users.|||
