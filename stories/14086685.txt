Motorola’s next entry level smartphone, named Moto E4, was spotted on the FCC, a few days back. Except that there were no information about this device, until yesterday. Yes, it had appeared on the Indonesian regulatory entity P3DN, which had revealed a few of its specs. Thus, we have gained some more info about the phone.

As per the listing, we could keenly understand that, the Moto E4 will be packed with a 2,300mAh battery; though the other device lined up for launch, the Moto E4 Plus is said to be coming with a 5,000mAh non-removable battery. If you are interested on the specs of the E4, then keep reading, we have it for you.

The E4 is powered by a MediaTek MT6737m processor, which is the same as in its predecessor (Moto E3) and is expected to arrive with a 4GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage. Since it is a cost effective device, it will probably be featured with a mediocre 5-inch FWVGA, which renders a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels (approximately 16:9 aspect ratio).

While coming to the cameras, the rear camera is adorned with 5 megapixels and a 2 megapixels for the front-facing camera. However, it is quite clear that this setup is not worth for a selfie shooter, in today’s times. Moreover, it runs on the Android 7.0 Nougat OS. Besides all these, the FCC claims that the Moto E4 will include 4G LTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi support and NFC support.

The leak also manifests that, both the Moto E4 and E4 Plus are be expected to be unveiled in the upcoming weeks. It is also expected that, these variant will be available only in specific markets. On the whole, we can assure that both the handsets have received FCC certification and will see the light of the day soon for sure. Let’s wait for some more leaks.|||
