CDep is a decentralized native package dependency manager with a focus on Android.

Anyone can author a package and there is a growing list of useful packages like Freetype 2.0, SDL, STB, RE2 Regular Expressions, Firebase, MathFu, Vectorial, Boost, Yaml-CPP, SQLite.

CDep comes from members of the Android Studio team and is not an official Google product. It is a work in progress and subject to change over time. Backward compatibility with existing packages will be maintained.

Here are some things you can do to get started with CDep.

Get started with CDep on Linux and Mac.

This created a four files in your local folder:

These files are meant to be checked into source control.

Now edit cdep.yml file to add a line like this.

This tells CDep that this project depends on SQLite.

Next, run cdep command to download SQLite and build CMake modules for it.

Now, if you have a CMake project then open CMakeLists.txt and add the following code at the end of the file.

This tells CMake to locate the module glue file and then to add all the dependencies in that file to the native-lib target. You'll need to change 'native-lib' to your own target name.

When you call CMake to generate the project you'll need to tell it where to find the glue modules. So something like,

Get started with CDep on Windows.

After this, the instructions are the same as Linux and Mac.|||
