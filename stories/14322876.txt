The Inside Back Cover picture shows an all-gas-phase unbiased photoelectrochemical cell that converts volatile organic pollutants to CO at a TiO photoanode. Simultaneously, energy is recovered as hydrogen gas at a dark Pt cathode. Air remediation is coupled to energy recuperation in a stand-alone device. The presence of oxygen in the carrier gas promotes the mineralization efficiency with only limited loss in photocurrent.
