As we discussed earlier Solr with Scala and AkkaHttp in our last blog we have used Solr as a service and tried to hit solr service with the AkkaHttp and spray routes. Here is the link for the Recap.

When we want to do testing for those methods which are creating connection with the remote solr server, have to use Embedded Solr for that.

Embedded Solr same interface as Solr without requiring an HTTP connection. When we “embed” Solr into a Java an application, It provides the exact same API as you would use if you were connecting to a remote Solr instance. We can use embedded solr for the in memory testing because when we implement test cases, it should not be depend on any external resources.

How can we use Embedded Solr?

When we wish to use Embedded Solr we have to follow some basic steps for creating an interface with embedded solr.

This is a basic code example for testing the embedded solr. If test case passes successfully, we are ready to do testing for the services.

 For more example and code please refer Knoldus Github.
