Someone should have warned this guy never to play with fire.

A YouTube video that surfaced last weekend shows a Japanese man unintentionally lighting his entire room on fire and catching the wild inferno on an internet livestream.

The nearly 12-minute video — which was viewed more than 4 million times by Monday afternoon — begins with the unidentified man apparently showing off a new oil match he had just bought to his livestream viewers.

After using lighter fluid to refuel the lighter, he wipes away excess fluid with tissues and places it into a plastic bag beside him.

Unfortunately, the man then attempts to light a match but accidentally sets the entire matchbox on fire and from that moment, chaos ensues.

The man drops the burning match into the bag of lighter fluid-filled tissues, which quickly went up in flames.

After moving the ignited bag to the opposite corner of the room, the man creates an even bigger blaze that he tries to snuff out with water, cardboard boxes and a blanket.

After failed attempts to extinguish the fire, smoke and flames engulf the entire room and the man is seen exiting.

It is unknown whether anyone was injured in the fire.|||
