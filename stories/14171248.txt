For this problem, imagine a simplified version of Quora where each question has only one topic associated with it. In turn, the topics form a simplified

ontology where each topic has a list of children, and all topics are descendants of a single root topic.



Design a system that allows for fast searches of questions under topics. There are topics, questions, and queries, given in this order. Each query has a desired topic as well as a desired string prefix. For each query, return the number of questions that fall under the queried topic and begin with the desired string. When considering topics, we want to include all descendants of the queried topic as well as the queried topic itself. In other words, each query searches over the subtree of the topic.



The topic ontology is given in the form of a flattened tree of topic names, where each topic may optionally have children. If a topic has children, they are listed after it within parentheses, and those topics may have children of their own, etc. See the sample for the exact input format. The tree is guaranteed to have a single root topic.



For ease of parsing, each topic name will be composed of English alphabetical characters, and each question and query text will be composed of English alphabetical characters, spaces, and question marks. Each question and query text will be well behaved: there will be no consecutive spaces or leading/trailing spaces. All queries, however, are case sensitive.



Constraints

 For 100% of the test data, and the input file is smaller than 5MB For 50% of the test data, and the input file is smaller than 1MB 

Input Format

 Line 4...M+3: Each line contains a topic name, followed by a colon and a space, and then the question text. Line M+5...M+K+4: Each line contains a topic name, followed by a space, and then the query text. 

Output Format

Line 1...K: Line should contain the answer for the th query.



Sample Input

 Quora has many questions on different topics, and a common product use-case for our @mention selectors and search service is to look-up questions under a certain topic as quickly as possible.For this problem, imagine a simplified version of Quora where each question has only one topic associated with it.

Sample Output

 



Explanation

The first query corresponds to the green area in the diagram, since it is looking for topics under Eagles, and the query string matches just one question: "How endangered are eagles?" The second query corresponds to the blue area in the diagram, which is the subtree of Birds, and matches two questions that begin with "Where". The third corresponds to the red area, which does not have any questions that begin with "Why do". The final query corresponds to the entire tree, since Animals is the root topic, and matches three questions.

We have a pretty good machine learning system in place for generating these topics, but it could always be better. Your goal in this task is to design a question topic labeler.



The input data consists of a training dataset of questions and an evaluation dataset of   questions. Your labeler should suggest 10 topics for each question in the evaluation set, ordered by relevance.



Input Format

The first line consists of two space-separated integers and .



The next   lines provide the training dataset. Each question in the training dataset is described by two lines:



 One integer , followed by positive integers (below 250) representing the topic IDs of the question in no particular order. On average, there are approximately 3 topics per question in the dataset. One string (between 1 and 500 printable ASCII characters), the question text. The average question text length is 70 characters. 

The next lines provide the evaluation dataset. Each question in the evaluation dataset is described by one line (between 1 and 500 ASCII characters), the question text.



Output Format

There are lines in total. The -th line contains 10 space-separated integers, each representing the topic id of a suggestion for the -th question in the evaluation dataset. To maximize your score, topic suggestions for a question should be ordered in descending order of relevance.



Sample Input

 When a user adds a question to Quora, we automatically suggest topics which might be relevant to the question. For example, a question about Dijkstra's algorithm would probably fit well under the topics "Algorithms" and "Graph Theory".We have a pretty good machine learning system in place for generating these topics, but it could always be better.

As the number of questions on Quora grows, there is an increasing likelihood that a new question may be a duplicate of an existing question. The text of the questions can vary significantly, but semantically might mean the same thing. We rely on human judgment to determine if 2 questions are considered to be duplicates and merge these questions together on Quora.



For this task, given Quora question text and topic data, determine if any 2 given pairs of questions are considered duplicates or not.



The following fields of raw data are given in JSON representing each question:



 context_topic (object): The primary topic of a question, if present. Null otherwise. The topic object will contain a name (string) and followers (integer) count. topics (array of objects): All topics on a question, including the primary topic. Each topic object will contain a name (string) and followers (integer) count. view_count (int): Number of views on the question. 

After the raw data for each question, the list of known duplicate questions and non-duplicate questions among all the given questions are shared as pairs of questions with an integer representing whether that pair is a duplicate or not (1 for duplicate and 0 for non-duplicate). All other pairings of any 2 questions that are not in this list are unknown to be duplicates or not and the test set will come from this. Note that all questions referenced by the training and test sets will be present in the list of raw question data.



Input Format

 The first line will contain an integer , which represents the number of lines of questions in the training data to follow. The next Q lines will contain JSON encoded fields of raw question data. The next line will contain an integer , which represent the number of lines of duplicate question pairs in the training data to follow. The next D lines will each contain 2 known duplicate questions identified by their unique question_key and an integer representing whether the pair are duplicates (1 for duplicate, 0 for non-duplicate) separated by spaces. (e.g. “abc def 1”) The next line will contain an integer for the number of lines of test question pair data to follow. The next N lines will each contain 2 test questions identified by their unique question_key separated by a space. 

Output Format

 N lines of 2 question keys and an integer representing whether the 2 test questions are duplicates (1 for duplicate and 0 for non-duplicate). (e.g. “ghi jkl 0”)

 Quora uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and moderation to ensure high-quality content on the site.
