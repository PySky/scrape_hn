Kotlin/Native is a LLVM backend for the Kotlin compiler, runtime implementation and native code generation facility using LLVM toolchain.

Kotlin/Native is primarily designed to allow compilation for platforms where virtual machines are not desirable or possible (such as iOS, embedded targets), or where developer is willing to produce reasonably-sized self-contained program without need to ship an additional execution runtime.

To compile from sources use following steps.

Then build the compiler and standard library:

To build standard library for cross-targets (currently, iOS on Mac OSX and Raspberry Pi on Linux hosts) use:

After that you should be able to compile your programs like that:

For an optimized compilation use :

For some tests, use:

To generate interoperability stubs create library definition file (take a look on ) and run tool like this:
