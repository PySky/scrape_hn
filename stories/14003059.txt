This experiment will enable everybody to start a secure browsing session using our proxy technology. You’ll get a view of the world through the eyes of Surfly, you could use it to access otherwise blocked content or prevent admins from snooping on your traffic as we encrypt all traffic inwards to Surfly.

While there are many web proxies available, most of them work pretty poorly with dynamic content. The technology that powers Surfly is much more robust and works by ‘sandboxing’ the dynamic content in such a way that most sites will continue to work flawlessly.|||
