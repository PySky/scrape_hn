Eagle.js is a slideshow system built on top of the Vue.js web framework. It supports animations, themes, interactive widgets (for web demos), and makes it easy to reuse components, slides and styles across presentations. For a quick tour, see this slideshow:

Most of all, Eagle.js aims at offering a simple and very hackable API so you can get off the beaten tracks and craft the slideshows you really want.

Here is what the Eagle.js syntax looks like (using Pug):

If you are not familiar with Vue.js you will find Eagle.js harder to use than, say, Reveal.js, but on the long term Eagle.js makes it easier to organize your slides and implement new ideas.

You must have Node.js/npm installed to use Eagle.js.

Then the best to get started is to clone the example repo:

Install the dependencies (they will only be downloaded in a local folder):

Then run to start the server, and open your browser at http://localhost:8080 to see the slideshows.

To start editing, click on to display this slideshow, then open the file and change the content of the first slide. Observe the changes happen automatically in your browser. The only times you need to refresh the page is when you add remove or add slides to the presentation.

Eagle.js is an open source framework originally written by Zulko and released on Github under the ISC licence. Everyone is welcome to contribute!
