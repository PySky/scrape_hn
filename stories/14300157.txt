In June 2016, Chinese company OnePlus announced the OnePlus 3, the new edition of its ‘flagship killer’ wanted to be an alternative to the leading androids of the year.

However, five months later, the company skipped its tradition of renewing its high end once a year and brought us the OnePlus 3T, an issue that brought improvements in processor, front camera, battery and a new color in the design.

In addition, the OnePlus 3T arrived in a version of 128 GB, model that has just been discontinued.

The 64GB OnePlus 3T is still available, but if we enter the Chinese company’s website, it no longer allows us to buy the 128GB OnePlus 3T edition. This decision coincides with the beginning of the rumors that will be his successor: the OnePlus 5.

Although not official at the moment, some of its possible specifications are already known and even sketches have been sketched showing a design with a very pixel style and dual cameras on both sides.

As we said, one of the innovations that came from the hand of the OnePlus 3T was the possibility of acquiring the variant with 128 GB capacity, which was only available in the Gunmetal color.

If you thought about getting this version, you were late. As shown in the image above, when trying to choose the OnePlus 3T of 128 GB in the official store, the message ‘discontinued’, or what is the same: discontinued.

Why have you made this decision? According to one brand representative, “OnePlus is a small company that needs to focus its efforts on a single high end. ” The brand justifies with this brief statement their decision, which also use to confirm that they will continue to offer support for the OnePlus 3T 128GB that is in circulation.

Although we do not know which model a ‘single high range’ refers to, after confirming the existence of the OnePlus 5 it is clear that the brand plans to focus on what will be its next flagship, which incidentally has filtered new details in form Of sketches.

At the moment we have not seen any real images of the device, but the rumor has already begun and these sketches give some interesting clues about the possible design of the OnePlus 5.

To begin with, the back part stands out for having two pieces of different tone and Material, a detail that inevitably remembers the Pixel, although in this case, the top piece would be ceramic and not crystal.

In the back also highlights the dual camera, one of the highlights that would bring the OnePlus 5. According to rumors, it would be two 12-megapixel sensors that would be accompanied by a double LED flash.

At the moment there are no details about the resolution that will have, but if the sketches are confirmed, the OnePlus 5 will also bet on a dual front camera, an option we have seen in Oppo F3 and that could also come with the next OnePlus.

In this latest sketch also features other interesting details like the minijack headphone or the USB-C port located at the bottom or the switch to put the cell phone quietly located on the side. Perhaps the detail we least like is that the camera protrudes from the chassis. OnePlus 5 is expected to be announced later this summer.|||
