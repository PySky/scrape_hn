Ever since Alex Krizhevsky, Geoff Hinton, and Ilya Sutskever won ImageNet in 2012, Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have become the gold standard for image classification. In fact, since then, CNNs have improved to the point where they now outperform humans on the ImageNet challenge!

While these results are impressive, image classification is far simpler than the complexity and diversity of true human visual understanding.

In classification, there’s generally an image with a single object as the focus and the task is to say what that image is (see above). But when we look at the world around us, we carry out far more complex tasks.

We see complicated sights with multiple overlapping objects, and different backgrounds and we not only classify these different objects but also identify their boundaries, differences, and relations to one another!

Can CNNs help us with such complex tasks? Namely, given a more complicated image, can we use CNNs to identify the different objects in the image, and their boundaries? As has been shown by Ross Girshick and his peers over the last few years, the answer is conclusively yes.

Through this post, we’ll cover the intuition behind some of the main techniques used in object detection and segmentation and see how they’ve evolved from one implementation to the next. In particular, we’ll cover R-CNN (Regional CNN), the original application of CNNs to this problem, along with its descendants Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN. Finally, we’ll cover Mask R-CNN, a paper released recently by Facebook Research that extends such object detection techniques to provide pixel level segmentation.

At Athelas, we use Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) for a lot more than just classification! In this post, we’ll see how CNNs can be used, with great results, in image instance segmentation. Ever…
