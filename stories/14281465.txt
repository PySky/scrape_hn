Over the past decade, I am sure that you have come across the term “S3” and you have probably seen it in the news, products, and mentioned on social media.  Today, many online services and applications use or support the S3 API for their storage needs and the numbers are rising. Enterprises are also beginning to move from legacy storage systems such as JBOD’s and arrays to S3 compatible storage solutions located on-premises to address scalability, cost, and data protection concerns. As more and more companies begin to adopt S3 storage in their data centers, they will need to begin looking at how to utilize the storage with their existing applications and workflows.

Developing applications that can take advantage of S3 based storage is very easy to do. This blog post will discuss the various S3 development libraries available and provide a walk through on creating a sample Node.js application that uses the S3 API.

The Scality S3 Server provides an easy way for developers to run an S3-compliant solution on their laptop via Docker with very little effort to easily test their S3 applications. To get started with developing or modifying an application to manipulate data on the S3 Server, your application will need to make S3 API calls. The easiest way to do this is by downloading an S3 Software Development Kit (SDK) for your desired programming language.

Here is a list of the common SDKs:
