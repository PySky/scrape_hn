PEKIN — A cyberattack last weekend has been forcing students, teachers and administrators at Pekin Community High School to forgo its computer systems.That hasn't been easy."You really quickly realize how much you rely on technology when you don't have access to it for a couple of days," Danielle Owens, the District 303 superintendent, said Wednesday.Pekin officials discovered the problem Monday. Sometime Sunday, a hacker apparently used malware to infect the school's computers.
