If the scrum team has been successfully using product backlog refinements in the past the sprint planning part 1 will be short. The development team and the product owner will adjust the discussed scope of the upcoming sprint to the available capacity. Maybe, someone from development team will not be available next sprint. So, one or two tasks will have to go back to the product backlog.

Or a valuable new task appeared overnight, and the product owner wants this task to become a part of the next sprint backlog. Consequently, some other user story needs to go back to the product backlog. A good team can handle that in five to ten minutes before moving on to sprint planning part 2. During sprint planning II the team breaks down the first set of sprint backlog items into subtasks.

There are three categories of sprint planning anti-patterns. They concern the development team, the product owner, and the scrum team:
