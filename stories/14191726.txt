Do you have things in your general insurance that you don’t need. Cut insurance rates by dropping any unnecessary coverage. If you drive an older model car that is not worth more than a few thousand dollars, you can drop collision coverage. Collision coverage pays to repair your car, but only up to its replacement value, which isn’t much if the car’s only worth a few grand. Comprehensive coverage works the same way, and covers car loss or damage due to fire, vandalism or theft. Compare the cost to replace your older car with the cost to maintain the insurance — it might not be worth it.

Be aware of any medical coverage that is included with your auto insurance policy. There can be a section on medical payments. This coverage pays for injuries to you and any occupants of your car. In some states, this is optional. In the”no-fault” states, personal injury protection will replace medical payments as part of the regular coverage.

If you think that your imperfect driving record unfairly affects your car insurance rate, you may try to ask if your rate can be lowered. For example, some companies will reduce your rate if you successfully complete a driving course following a ticket or accident. Some companies, such as Progressive, will install a chip in customer’s cars that will monitor their driving each day. If the chip reports that you’ve been driving responsibly, you’ll soon be paying lower rates.

And Sign up to get your auto insurance directly through the website of the insurance company of your choosing. General auto insurance is often cheaper when you apply online because it costs the company less to process your information that way. You may receive a discount of up to 10 percent by applying online.

Now this information had me like wow, I have always thought why ask my miles per year. But It is a little known fact but you should know that most auto insurance companies give discounts to those who drive less than 7,500 miles a year. If you are on the cusp of this, consider taking public transportation a few times, and then report that you are under 7,500 and get your discount.

Take notes and document conversations when you are obtaining general auto insurance quotes. Since each carrier is slightly different, you may find it helpful to keep detailed notes of the various offers when it comes time to review your options. As a side benefit, if you have spoken with an agent or direct representative, having notes enables you to reach back out to the same person if you have additional questions.
