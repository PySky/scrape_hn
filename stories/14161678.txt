Playing GIFs Against Friends is seen as the #1 cause for contracting GAF - a highly infectious disease that’s tearing its way through the country. Symptoms include: 1) wondering if life is just a really long GIF, and 2) coming up with prompts about The Rock while pooping. 



The best way to protect yourself from GAF is to live under a rock for the rest of your life. If that doesn’t sound feasible, then buckle and grab your meme cannon. 



Save yourself and your loved ones before it's too late.

*************************************************



If you still dare to play, here’s how it works: 



You start with a prompt. Everyone in the chat submits a GIF anonymously. The judge then picks the funniest, most ridiculous, or undeniably accurate GIF as the winner. After being showered in coins, the winner is then officially deemed the Master GAFer.

Our Favorite Write-In Prompts:

- When my grandma described her blueberry pie as ‘on fleek’

- When I farted in the elevator then someone passed out

- MFW my friend made out with a pigeon
