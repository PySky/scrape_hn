Apple is rolling out iOS 10.3 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. The latest software update includes Find My AirPods support, CarPlay improvements, Apple’s new filesystem, and more.

iOS 10.3 is the first version to include Find My AirPods in the Find My iPhone app, Wi-Fi Calling for iCloud-connected devices for Verizon customers, and a new 32-bit alert that suggests iOS 11 could be 64-bit only.
