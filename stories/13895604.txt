Front-end developers have many considerations to make when working with web apps and sites. Once you’ve set up the perfect environment with the right libraries and tools, you’ll have to figure out the coding techniques you’ll apply. What if there was a way to build a web app that would just let you focus on… just building the web app?

Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to HTML, CSS and JavaScript — error free. How? Its strong static typing system and time machine process allow you to crush bugs through reproducible and predictive debugging. Not to mention, Elm’s immutable data structures and compile time error reporting will help you save time and build a solid and robust app.

There are many reasons why you’d want to start learning Elm!

In our new mini course, we’ll show you how to get started with Elm, how to understand and work with Elm’s data structures, and how to continue learning. Our course barely scratches the surface of Elm, but we will give you everything you need to kick-start your new future with Elm.

This mini-course is perfect for those who know HTML, CSS and JavaScript and ready to take their front-end development skills to the next level with some functional programming with Elm.|||
