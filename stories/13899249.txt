Messenger bot called Around ME that shows you cool places around you (wherever you are)

For the past few years I’ve been reading and learning about chat interfaces and most of all, chat bots. There is a huge hype around them (a legit one) and a lot of apps are now written in chat bot form. Chat interfaces are emerging as a most natural way for people to communicate. But, I’m not here to talk about that. You probably know all of that. I’m here to introduce a bot that I made. It’s called Around ME.

Around ME is a Facebook Messenger bot which based on location you provide, searches and shows you a desired type of places around you. It works anywhere in the world so it’s kinda amazing and very useful when you travel. And you don’t need to install any new app beside Messenger.

It’s super easy to use. Let me demonstrate it:

And that’s it (at least for now).

*Around ME is still in beta but it’s fully operational and ready for use.*

Try it, like a page, share with your friends. :)

If you have any suggestions, feedback or want to talk about bots in general, write a comment or send me an email at aroundme@elev8.rs|||
