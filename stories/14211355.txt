United Airlines is promising to reduce overbooking and offer as much as $10,000 to customers who give up their seats on oversold flights, as it tries to recover from lasting outrage over videos of a bloodied passenger being dragged down the aisle of a plane after refusing to give up his seat.

The changes Chicago-based United announced Thursday, part of a broader internal review, are the airline's latest attempt to put the debacle behind it after an initially tepid apology only added fuel to the backlash.

"Every customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect. Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologize. However, actions speak louder than words. Today, we are taking concrete, meaningful action to make things right and ensure nothing like this ever happens again," United CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement.

United's internal review of the April 9 incident on a plane at O'Hare International Airport showed that "our policies got in the way of our values and our procedures interfered in doing what's right," Munoz said. "This is a turning point for all of us at United, and it signals a culture shift toward becoming a better, more customer-focused airline."

Chicago Aviation Department officers dragged Dr. David Dao off United Express Flight 3411 after he refused to give up his seat to make room for airline employees. For many customers, the incident, video of which went viral, was a reminder that paying for a ticket doesn't guarantee a seat, highlighting longtime industry practices around oversold flights.

United identified four "failures" related to the incident: calling in law enforcement when there was no security or safety issue; rebooking employees at the last minute; not offering enough compensation or convenient transportation options to get customers to willingly give up seats; and failing to give employees the training and authority to resolve the situation.

The airline also outlined 10 policy changes, some of which have been previously announced:

•United will only call in law enforcement officers to remove customers from flights if it's a matter of safety and security. That policy has been in place since April 12.

•United won't involuntarily bump customers already seated on the plane unless safety or security is at risk, starting Thursday.

•When a flight is too full, United will offer customers up to $10,000 to voluntarily switch to a later flight, starting Friday.

•The airline plans to create a customer service team to identify "creative solutions" gate agents can offer to help get bumped passengers or airline employees to their destinations when flights are full. Those solutions could include suggesting a flight to a nearby airport that offers ground transportation to the customer's ultimate destination. United expects that team to be up and running by June.

•As of April 14, any airline employees traveling for work must be booked on a flight at least an hour before departure.

•Starting in August, United will give all employees who interact with customers annual training on handling "the most difficult of situations." United said it doesn't currently provide annual training on handling situations in which customers are denied boarding.

•To help identify customers who might be willing to voluntarily give up a seat without resorting to announcements at the gate, United is planning to add a step to the check-in process — either in its app or at the airport — gauging customers' interest in switching to a later flight in exchange for compensation. The process will be rolled out later this year.

•United says it will cut back on overbooking on flights where it has struggled to find volunteers, especially flights on smaller planes, and the final flights of the day.

•By July, flight attendants will have an app to help handle customer service issues by compensating customers – with miles, for instance – when things go wrong. Gate agents will get the same app later this year.

•United says it will make it easier for passengers to get reimbursed when the airline permanently loses their luggage. Customers will be entitled to $1,500 for the lost bag and its contents automatically, and may be asked for additional documentation for larger claims.

Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said he thinks United struck the right balance between policies that help the airline run reliably and allowing discretion when warranted.

"If anything, where they looked at it and it was 50-50, they went in favor of the passenger," said Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group, though he noted some customers would have liked to see more details on what constitutes a "safety and security" issue in which the airline can call in law enforcement.

Some of the changes are "commonsense" policies that should already have been in place, Harteveldt said, such as letting employees consider alternate destinations or forms of transportation to get bumped passengers where they're headed.

Some in the industry questioned whether United could have settled the Dao incident by offering volunteers more cash. According to United's review, it might have worked: A customer said he'd willingly switch for $1,000. United said none of the other customers were willing to volunteer unless it could guarantee they'd make it to Louisville later that night.

The new policy of offering volunteers up to $10,000 matches Delta Air Lines' top offer.

While United said it wants to make sure it's involuntarily bumping as few customers as possible, it did shed some light on how it chooses who to bump when it can't avoid it.

Any passengers who don't have a seat assignment are the first to go. United then looks at passengers who paid the lowest fare. If multiple customers paid the same lowest rate, the last to check in are the first to be bumped.

That said, United says it doesn't bump members of its frequent flyer program unless all of the customers who could be bumped are members — then, those with the lowest status are most likely to be bumped. Unaccompanied minors and passengers with disabilities won't be bumped if they don't volunteer, United said.|||
