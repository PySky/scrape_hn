The future of America and the free world!

It all started listening to a Ted Talk by Lawrence Lessig, it led us to understand the Republic of Unites States of America and it’s politics.

Loads of reading from opensecrets.org , into the funding structure of elections and who pays whom etc. , lot of debates and the sheer enormity of numbers. Some facts and numbers

Attending a large number of meetings such CaliforniaForward ( a bi partisan initiatives By Lee Mendonca) ; Young republicans of San mateo arranged by Jonathan Madison and others, helped understand the challenges surrounding revitalizing the electoral process and bring it to the 21st century.

So we looked around for existing solutions such as twitter and facebook and wanted to verify if they are effective as standalone platforms for electoral politics.

Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton)currently leads the race among the current crop with 4.29M followers , Donald trump (@realDonaldTrump) a close second with 4.23M users. Ben carson is at 656K followers.

Social Media by itself though was deemed as an important by the electorate. A pew research study showed overall almost 16% of the electorate followed their leaders on a social media platform.

A germ of a solution started taking shape. The solution has to be mobile, has to have space for comments, debates, news. It had to be exclusive so that we can have a better signal to noise ratio. It had to be hyperlocal and national at the same time. It had to be contextual. It should make the process bi-directional, it should bring the polity and electorate in a tight embrace.

Thus we created 1600 Pennsylvania , where Hopes and Desires create the future of the Republic of USA.
