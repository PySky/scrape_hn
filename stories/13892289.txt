When reading code—either to get an understanding of a system, or while debugging a problem—few things are as valuable to me as the knowledge that the author sees a problem in a particular part of it, as indicated by a FIXME comment. That directs me to scrutinize that part more closely. Perhaps even more importantly, it lets me measure how close my understanding of the code is to the author's state of mind when writing it.|||

Why you should be proud, not fearful, of having FIXME or TODO notes in your source code, and why a policy banning them is actively harmful.
