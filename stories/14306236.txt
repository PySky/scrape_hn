Chipset manufacturer Qualcomm just announced a new line-up of mid-range models, consisting in the Snapdragon 660 and 630, the successors of last year’s 652 and 625 models.

The new chipset don’t offer just better performance, but also come with the promise of faster LTE connectivity and enhanced battery life. Let’s find out more details about each of them…

The Snapdragon 660 was presented as an octa-core chip, with four Kyro 260 cores, working at 2.2 GHz, as well as four more Kyro cores, but clocked at 1.8 GHz, built on a 14nm manufacturing process. Otherwise, the manufacturer didn’t provide any other details about the cores, but they are most likely built using the ARM Cortex technology, also used for the Kyro 280 cores, present in Qualcomm’s flagship, chipset, the Snapdragon 835.

Moving on, the chipset comes with an Adreno 512 GPU, with Vulkan API support, offering 30 percent better graphics performance, while overall, the chip can deliver with up to 20 percent better performance, compared to the previous Snapdragon 653 model.

Finally, we should also mention that it supports a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels, while the included Snapdragon X12 LTE modem can reach a maximum download speed of up to 600 Mbps, as well as upload speeds of 150 Mbps. It also has support for up to 8GB of RAM, Bluetooth 5, USB Type-C and Quick Charge 4.0.

The second chip announced by Qualcomm, Snapdragon 630, is not as powerful as the 660, featuring four Cortex-A53 cores, working at 2.2 GHz, as well as four more Cortex-A53 units, but functioning at 1.8GHz. The Adreno 508 GPU is also present, offering support for Vulkan API.

The maximum resolution supported by the Snapdragon 630 is 1920 x 1200 pixels, while in terms of RAM, it can take up to 8GB. Otherwise, it offers support for 4K UHD video shooting, USB Type-C, Snapdragon X12 LTE, Bluetooth 5 and Quick Charge 4.0.

Both chipsets are expected to deliver increased battery performance, with 50 to 75 percent lower consumption while using location based services and a reduction of 60 percent power consumption on Wi-Fi.

Some of the handsets expected to use the new chips are the upcoming OPPO R11, Samsung Galaxy C10, Sony Xperia X Ultra or the Xiaomi Mi Max 2.|||
