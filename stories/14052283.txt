Startup School is a free 10-week massively open online course (MOOC). The course started on April 5th, 2017. It was started by Y Combinator with the aim of inspiring people to start a startup, teach people about how to start a startup, equip them with the resources and tools to help prepare them and build a community of entrepreneurs who can encourage and teach each other.

There are two tracks:

Teams that successfully complete the Startup founder track will be given a chance to share their creation with a wide audience and will receive a certificate of completion.
