Today's Firefox release makes Firefox faster and more stable with a separate process for graphics compositing (the Quantum Compositor). Compact themes and tabs save screen real estate, and the redesigned permissions notification improves usability. Learn more on the Mozilla Blog.

We'd also like to extend a special thank you to all of the new Mozillians who contributed to this release of Firefox!|||
