“Customers have the power to make or break companies. With 140 characters they can wreak havoc or sing your praises.

It’s not just Twitter. They can use Facebook, contact forms, email, forums, face-to-face, letters, Reddit, petitions, and famously even songs, to get their message across.

If you don’t at least take customer feedback on board, then you’re annoying the very people you’re trying to please.

Besides, if you ignore their feature requests, feedback, and ideas then you’re missing out on a mountain of gloriously useful information about what to build in order to drive the growth of your business.

But if you open your ears, and point them in the direction of your customers, then you can start listening. You can hear what they have to say, and not only that, you can act on what they say.

You have two ears for listening, and one mouth for communicating.

It’s better for you, it’s better for them, it’s better for everyone.

Welcome to the age of the consumer. Please watch your step.”

The book is aimed at SaaS companies who want to use customer feedback to make data-driven decisions about their product. In particular, Product Managers will find this useful, but the knowledge can be applied to people throughout your organization.|||
