Some months ago I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 but I never actually done anything meaningful with it. So, after spending some time browsing the web for interesting ideas, I decided to start fresh from scratch installing Ubuntu Core.

There are a few reasons why I decided to go with this particular Linux distro, some unique to it and some more common:

I don’t really need these features as I’ll essentially only toy around with the little Raspberry but curiosity got the best of me.

The installation media creation process is quite straightforward and similar to other Linux guides, therefore I will not spend time on it. I did found a minor issue with the guide while creating the installation media on macOS but it should get fixed after reporting it.

Now things get a little funky. You cannot immediately access the system remotely via SSH. Instead, there is a brief initial configuration to do directly on the Rpi so you’ll need a keyboard and a monitor. You’ll also need an active internet connection via Ethernet. Once the initial setup is done you can remove the I/O peripherals and connect via SSH if you wish.

Now you can connect remotely from within the same local network via SSH and it should be something like this:

The username is the same of your Ubuntu SSO account and you can find it in the “Personal details” section of your account.

Important: you will be prompted to insert a password and, while it might be intuitive to use your SSO one, in reality you’ll need to provide the same password you used to create the SSH Key you imported in your account.

Now that my system is up and running I’m planning to toy around a bit with Snaps, create at least one or two and see how the adventure goes! I will share my thought and discoveries in the following weeks.|||

Recently I found an inspiring article about how, as a developer, documenting one’s own experiments through blogging is more constructive than what I thought. For this reason I decided to start giving…
