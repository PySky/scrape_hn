Nanobox is the ideal platform for developers.



Taking on the role of DevOps, so you don't have to, Nanobox does all your infrastructure creation, configuration, and management, so you're able to focus on code, not config.



Create consistent, isolated, development environments that are easily shareable with anyone, and can be deployed to any host (AWS, Digital Ocean, Azure, Google, etc.).



Easily manage production applications with the Nanobox dashboard. Deploy and scale with zero downtime, and monitor your application's health with the statistics panel and the streaming and historical log output.
