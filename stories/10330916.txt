Many website owners turn to Cloud-based Security Providers (CBSPs) to protect their infrastructure. For DNS-based services, it is crucial that a web server's real IP address remains hidden from potential attackers as it can be used to bypass the cloud-based protection. Despite this risk, our study has shown that, in practice, over 70% of CBSP-protected domains are exposing their real IP address. 

 With CloudPiercer, we provide a tool for administrators to automatically evaluate their web server's exposure for several high-profile vectors. This information can then be used to remediate the problem.
