I love the articles written by Jimmy Maher, the “Digital Antiquarian”! Being also the author of the excellent “The Future was Here – The Commodore Amiga“, Maher has been writing about computer (hardware and software) history for a long time, and you can find them all on his blog.

This time around he published one talking about the IBM PC architecture, tackling not only the infamous 640k barrier but other aspects of the PC architecture, and its evolution.

The text is clear and easily understandable for any non-technical reader, so even if you belong to that category but are an avid retro computer enthusiast, you should take a look. As usual, the post is very extensive, so maybe sending it to your eBook, or reading on a tablet if a better choice!|||
