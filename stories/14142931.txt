President Donald Trump on Tuesday will sign an executive order calling for a review of the H-1B visa program, which brings high-skilled immigrants to the United States.

Trump will sign the “Buy American and Hire American” order during his trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin, the White House told reporters on Monday.

The executive order will not make any changes to the visa program — it would simply initiate a review and order the Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State Departments to come up with changes to ensure that the visas go to the highest skilled workers, the administration told reporters. It would also direct those agencies to strictly enforce the laws governing the H-1B program, per the White House.

Trump’s order will also call for the Commerce Department to reduce waivers and exceptions to “Buy American” laws, the administration told reporters.|||
