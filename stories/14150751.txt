We’re now three to four years into DevOps, depending on your point of view—which means we have just a few years left before the acronym comes under fire, and its replacements are queued up. Just as I fought the term “DevOps,” I’m almost certain I’ll fight whatever the new term is, regardless of its relevance. And the replacement process has already begun.

The “NoOps” movement is still ticking, although it’s essentially been squashed; “DevSecOps” seeks to be the mature replacement of “DevOps.” Then there’s “AIOps” (which from what I gather on one end is replacing developers all together, while the other is making automation autonomous).

How we define methodologies and the technology to support them doesn’t matter—at all. The continuum of improvement is never broken. Each generation is simply an easier way to have a conversation about how to improve what we do. So if you weed through the BS of the labels, you quickly realize that the value is simply that, with one word, the person you are chatting with can be on the same page with you. It’s a language tool, which isn’t really sexy (to those of us in the tech field, anyway).

So “AIOps” here we go. The term makes sense. Automation has served as the glue that has taken us from ITSM to ALM to DevOps. So improving automation makes sense—and the DevOps generation of tooling has added tremendous functionality and data to make better automation possible. (Consider anomaly detection in logging platforms like SumoLogic, LogEntries/Rapid7, and DataDog, along with pipeline automation with tools like CodeFresh, CodeShip, and Werker, as well as bots mostly developed by you.)

This data and an obsession with automation are what will make bots smarter and even more popular.

My current prediction is that in 2017, bots will be a huge focus. And perhaps, just maybe, the catalyst for the “DevOps” replacement. Maybe it’s not AIOps. maybe it’s BotOps. (Still horrible.) Maybe a word-compounding genius will come up with something that blows all our minds.

I’m not the only one who’s thinking about this. In a recent interview, LogiGear CEO Hung Nguyen told me, “I think that AI is going to be a big part of the next generation of development tools.”

Here are three reasons I believe bots are the next phase.

So right now (unlike the early days of DevOps), if you are interested in modern delivery chains, you’ve probably already considered or are already using bots. We need more.

So if you are going to build a new tool today, you might think about something around bot building. Automation is the place to go, versus yet another logging or release automation platform.

The terminology may get to me, but, regardless, there will be a replacement for DevOps (even though DevOps is a mode of operation, instead of a thing). In 2017, the bot obsession will expand. And in 2018, it will become a market. Its job will not be to replace IT and development, no matter how appealing that drama is. The job will instead be to get QA, Support, and Maintenance up to speed with continuous development, and to mitigate IT fire drills so you can sleep better.|||
