If you've never tried N-Back before, here's a quick tutorial to get you started.

It's best to begin with 1-Back, the simplest mode.

You will hear a Melody every 3 seconds. If you don't hear any sound, make sure your speakers are not muted.

The 1-Back part indicates how many trials back you're being asked to remember to decide if the melody match the current melody.

Melody N-Back starts in 2-Back mode by default. 2-Back is significantly more difficult than 1-Back. Don't be discouraged - learning and practicing this exercise at the limit of your ability is what increases your fluid intelligence!

This time, you will need to remember the Melody from 2 trials back instead of 1 trial back.|||
