These days, there are so many ways not to cook your own meals, sometimes I wonder if the act of cooking is becoming a thing of the past. On one side of the spectrum, we have products like Soylent which act as a meal replacement. On the other side, we have a plethora of companies all vying for top contender in the food delivery space and itâ€™s a big industry! Now you can even have robots delivery your food to you. ðŸ¤”

Now, Iâ€™m not hating on convenient food options. Iâ€™ve drank my fair share of Soylent, I get my food delivered to me sometimes, I do eat out occasionally, and Iâ€™m very grateful to have the ability to do so. These services are convenient and, some days, I donâ€™t think I would be able to find the time to prepare meals without them. All that said, I think that itâ€™s important to make these quicker meal options supplemental to cooking that you do at home. There is some intrinsic value in cooking for yourself, especially if youâ€™re cooking with family, friends, or a partner.

Recently Iâ€™ve challenged myself to cook at home much more and Iâ€™ve discovered that cooking the majority of my own meals in the midst of a work week is actually really fucking hard! There are some good tricks that make it easier but learning those takes some time. If you werenâ€™t thinking much about cooking before (as I wasnâ€™t), it can be difficult to carve enough mindshare to dedicate to the kitchen.

Cooking at home costs less (although you spend more time doing it) and it is generally healthier for you. But I think the biggest benefit to preparing your own meals is that cooking and eating together with friends, family, and community is good for the soul. Itâ€™s not something that is easily measured; still, the value of celebrating food is undeniable.|||
