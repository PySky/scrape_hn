When we were designing pisound one of the main goals was to empower everyone to use pisound and Raspberry Pi in headless mode - without an external monitor, keyboard or mouse.

As it turns out, one button is all you need to achieve this and we call it The Button.

Its functionality can be customized according to your needs. By default using The Button you can open patches straight from a USB thumb drive, safely close them, shut down the Raspberry Pi and even launch “pisound” Wi-Fi hotspot, so that you can connect to the device via SSH, VNC or send WiFi-MIDI messages directly to your Pi using smart phone or tablet.

Our favorite use-case for it - you can run your Pure Data patches, without any need to connect a display, keyboard or mouse, just by plugging in a USB drive containing “main.pd”, any optional MIDI controller / keyboard, click The Button once and Voilà!

* Triple-click WiFi hotspot works with Raspberry Pi 3 & Zero W out of the box. Other versions require SoftAP capable USB WiFi adapter to be plugged in.|||
