SpaceILâ€™s goal is to inspire the next generation of children in Israel and around the world to think differently about science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). SpaceIL is committed to using the Google Lunar X Prize money to promote science and scientific education in Israel, to ensure that Israel will continue to live up to its reputation for excellence in these fields.

SpaceIL is collaborating with a range of educational partners in the development of learning platforms, content, and curriculum. We are using the story of the spacecraft and the SpaceIL journeyto create excitement among the younger generation.

SpaceIL is working to show every child in Israel the inspiring story of the first Israeli spacecraft.|||
