The McDonald’s India app, McDelivery is leaking personal data for more than 2.2 million of its users which includes name, email address, phone number, home address, accurate home co-ordinates and social profile links.

Even though McDelivery was made aware of this issue on 7th Feb by Fallible and acknowledged on 13th Feb (33 days ago), the issue still exists and is a serious privacy threat.

Maybe, India needs a stricter data and privacy laws for companies to stop being so casual about these issues.

Imagine this happening in US or China!
