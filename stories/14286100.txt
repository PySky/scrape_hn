I can’t remember where I stumbled upon the recommendation for Joy, Inc.–How We Built a Workplace People Love by Richard Sheridan but having read it at the beginning of this very new year couldn’t have come at a better time.

In this very well told book Richard describes how coming from a dreadful time of IT projects that were executed as death marches he built Menlo Innovations based on the believe that aiming for joy would be the highest value of his enterprise. He defines joy as working on meaningful projects in an environment where fear is absent and everyday actions have the purpose of delivering a product that customers love.

This notion in itself is not surprising or new but what makes this book an exemption from the many Make-Your-Employess- Happy-To-Build-Great-Products-Books which describe organizations that are great places to work at he describes what methodologies Menlo Innovations uses in great and applicable detail. In addition he doesn’t fall short in explaining how his ideas are able to enable a sustainable and growing business with happy clients while creating a working environment that is free from overtime, has full vacation flexibility and leaves room for employees to engage in social community and educational work.

Joy, Inc. leaves no excuse to go on the pursuit of joy at the workplace on your own.|||
