To calculate a company's market cap, you simply take the current stock price and multiply it by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if Apple (AAPL) had 935 million shares outstanding and its stock price was $570 per share, its market cap would be $532.9 billion (935 times $570). Market cap is often used by investors to obtain a quick estimate as to a company's overall value. Investors will often use market capitalization as one factor in determining a prospective stock purchase. For example, an institutional investor may want to limit their stock purchases to companies with market capitalizations greater than $5 billion in order to ensure sufficient liquidity. Stocks are often categorized by market cap: large-cap ($10 billion or more), mid-cap ($2 billion-$10 billion), small-cap ($300 million-$2 billion), and micro-cap (less than $300 million).
