My name is Shabeer and I  recently joined the MaaxMarket team as Product Manager..

I need a help and I want to make sure this isn’t considered as a marketing outreach. At MaaxMarket we are working hard to bring in the next generation marketing automation platform designed specifically for Small Businesses.

Our product development is progressing very rapidly and we want to make sure we are progressing on the right path. We need to show what we have built so far and get the feedback from our customers and early adopters.

Will you help us please?

The goal for our startup is simple. We want to help Small Businesses around the world in automating their marketing efforts. Let me break it down. As a Business, you have various marketing avenues to reach your customers like Email, Social Media, Website (WordPress), Ads etc… But how can you keep track of all these marketing tools in one place and make sure they all work coherently?

This is what we do at MaaxMarket. We have built a simplified platform that can send personalized content across your entire lead and customer base and make sure you are constantly engaging with your customers and thus automating your marketing efforts.

We have scheduled a webinar on Wed, Oct 14, 2015 9:00 AM – 10:00 AM PDT. where we want to showcase the demo of our product and gather your feedback. I personally invite you all to help us in shaping the future of small business marketing automation.

For those who are registering and joining this webinar, we would like to offer 1 year worth of MaaxMarket product free of cost (no questions asked) since you are the ones who are helping us in shaping this product to perfection. This is a small token of appreciation.
