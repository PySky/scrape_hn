People often ask me what I’m doing now.

Each time I would type out a reply, describing where I’m at, what I’m focused on, and what I’m not.

So earlier this year I added a /now page to my site: sivers.org/now

It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused. A public declaration of priorities.

It helps me say no, too. When I decline invitations, I point them to that page to let them know it’s not personal.

Anyway, today the brilliant Gregory Brown announced that he added a /now page to his site!

I re-tweeted his announcement, and within hours, 8 more people made a /now page!

I love it! I wish everyone had one!

If you make a /now page on your site, please add the URL in the body of a comment, below. Use the full http:// URL, so it will be a clickable link.

(You do get what’s going on here, don’t you? Gregory Brown has started a movement!) ☺|||
