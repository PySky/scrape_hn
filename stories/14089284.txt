vue-authenticate is easily configurable solution for Vue.js that provides local login/registration as well as Social login using Github, Facebook, Google and Twitter OAuth providers (only those 4 tested for now).

The best part about this library is that it is not strictly coupled to one request handling library like vue-resource. You will be able to use it with different libraries.

For now it is tested to work with vue-resource (default library) and axios (using vue-axios wrapper).

This library was inspired by well known authentication library for Angular called Satellizer developed by Sahat Yalkabov. They share almost identical configuration and API so you can easily switch from Angular to Vue.js project.

For now, this package only supports ES6 import usage, but soon will have standalone ES5 build.

Once you have created VueAuthenticate instance, you can use it in Vuex store like this:

Later in Vue component, you can dispatch Vuex state action like this

You can easily setup custom request and response interceptors if you use different request handling library. Fro example, if you use axios in your app, request and response interceptors would look something like this:

Important: You must set both and interceptors if your uses request handling library other than (default library).
