I am evangelizing the 10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint. Itâ€™s quite simple: a pitch should have ten slides, last no more than twenty minutes, and contain no font smaller than thirty points. This rule is applicable for any presentation to reach agreement: for example, raising capital, making a sale, forming a partnership, etc.

The infographic created in collaboration with my friends at Visually will help you fine tune what to put on your ten slides. I hope this helps you create a winning pitch deck for your startup.|||
