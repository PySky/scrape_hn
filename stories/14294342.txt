This video shows you how to improve your program with dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is the best way to create better programs and in general improve your programming skills



If you want to succeed as a programmer, you should change the fundamental way of your thinking. imagine that you are trying to change the addition in your operating system. Now let’s assume that you succeed to decrease the run time of this function for about 1ns. This is nothing important, right? If you create a program that has 3 loops with 10.000 iteration each one and 5 additions is 10.000 power bmy 3 multiplied by 5. So here we have this number 5.000.000.000.000 of additions. So in this particular program, we can save approximately 5.000 seconds which is about 83 minutes, in other words very important optimization in our program. So let’s try to turn on the switch of dynamic programming. dynamic programming. improve your program

Let’s try to craft our way of thinking from a simple primary school problem.improve your program

Suppose, there are 5 apples in the basket and we add 2 more. Obviously, we will finally have 7 apples. But how can you be sure about the result without counting it? This is such a stupid question, there are 5 apples and we put 2 more, so 5 + 2 is equal to 7 apples. But in this case, you don’t count apples, you just add them and tell the answer, right? I am right now focusing on counting itself, BUT counting from zero (0+5+2) is not necessary. When we already know the previous number of apples, this is just waste of time. Here we can optimize by using memory and more specifically by adding to the previous number (5+2) instead of just counting from zero. dynamic programming. improve your program

 

 Suppose that you want to find out the best movie in each genre, like action, animation, adventure, etc. First, the computer will collect data and based on a function it will evaluate every movie. In the case that you want to go a step further and find out the best movie among all genres, there are two ways. The first one is to compare all the movies on every genre on the same criteria. And the second is to keep the memory of the 3 movies that are the best in every category and compare only them. The idea here is to reduce computational time and overall optimize our programs by using already available results. dynamic programming 

 Same way can be applied to find out the longest river in the world if we already have a list of the longest river in each country. improve your program

 



Find out a solution more efficiently using previously obtained results is called Dynamic programming in computer science. 

First, we divide problems into smaller ones, by finding patterns and similarities. The goal here is to solve a unique problem only once and use it to obtain Big problem solution. Dynamic programming eliminates repetitive tasks in order to get the faster solution. If we find patterns into sub-problems of a given problem, we can apply dynamic programming.
