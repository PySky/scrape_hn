I am trying to interact with a 3rd-party html5 video player in Chrome. I am able to obtain a valid reference to it thusly:

...and the is 4, so it's all good.

I can successfully (and with expected result) call:

...the video freezes and it doesn't advance to the new . The video duration is much longer than 500 seconds, so it should be able to advance to that spot. I have tried other times besides 500, all with same result. If I examine , it is correct as to what I just set. But it doesn't actually go there. Also I can no longer interact with the video. It ignores any calls to or after I try to set .

Before I call , when I call I get this valid promise back, and everything else still works:

After I call , when I call , I get this broken promise back, and now nothing works on that video object:

If you have a Hulu account you can easily observe this behavior on any video by simply trying it in the Chrome developer console.

EDIT: It was pointed out to me that skipping very much ahead breaks, but skipping a short distance actually works well. Could be related to commercials interspersed.|||
