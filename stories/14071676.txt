 This article lists out some of the commonly asked Maze problems in technical interviews.

Find the total number of unique paths which the robot can take in a given maze to reach the destination from given source.

Given a maze in the form of the binary rectangular matrix, find length of the shortest path in maze from given source to given destination. The path can only be constructed out of cells having value 1 and at any given moment, we can only move one step in one of the four directions.

Given a maze in the form of the binary rectangular matrix, find length of the shortest path in a maze from given source to given destination.

Given a rectangular field with few sensors present on it, cross it by taking the shortest safe route without activating the sensors. The rectangular field is given in the form of M x N matrix and we need to find the shortest path from any cell in first column to any cell in the last column of the matrix.

Given a N x N matrix of positive integers, find a path from the first cell of the matrix to its last cell.Â We can move exactly k steps from any cell in the matrix where k is the value of that cell. i.e. from any cell in the matrix M, we can move to locationÂ 

 M[i + M[i][j]][j] or M[i â€“ M[i][j]][j] or M[i][j + M[i][j]] or M[i][j â€“ M[i][j]] .

Given a N x N matrix of positive integers, find shortest path from the first cell of the matrix to its last cell that satisfies given constraints.Â We can move exactly k steps from any cell in the matrix where k is the value of that cell. i.e. from any cell in the matrix M, we can move to locationÂ 

 M[i + M[i][j]][j] or M[i â€“ M[i][j]][j] or M[i][j + M[i][j]] or M[i][j â€“ M[i][j]].

Given a rectangular path in the form of binary matrix, find the length of longest possible route from source to destination position of the matrix by moving to only non-zero adjacent positions i.e. route can be formed from positions having their value as 1. Note there should not be any cycles in the output path.
