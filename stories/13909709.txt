This is a prop replica of the amber cane John Hammond used in the movie Jurassic Park! My portion was the completion of the amber topper!



It came out amazing. We are now one step closer to cloning a dinosaur! 



This collaboration between myself and pocket took us 2 years to pull off due to various setbacks and issues! It's great to finally be able to show this to you, as not talking about it for this long has been hard for me!
