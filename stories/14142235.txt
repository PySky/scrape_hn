Uncontrolled blood pressure, just like the air pressure in the bursting of a balloon, can greatly harm and kill individuals. But, like many diseases, it can be controlled. Monitoring blood pressure is an option, and visiting doctors when it spikes is a preemptive measure thatâ€™ll help people live longer. I am hopeful this campaign will help get rid of the illnesses that rob us of the chance to spend more time with the people we love.

 I would like to dedicate this video to my mother, who passed away in 13 September 2016, having suffered from high blood pressure, which has led her to hemorrhage stroke. 

 I am asking everyone to share this film with someone they love, so high blood pressure awareness is passed on to millions.
