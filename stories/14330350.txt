Weâ€™re planning a smaller WP release early next month, bringing in three major enhancements:

The first beta of 4.8 is now available for testing. You can use the beta tester plugin (or just run trunk) to try the latest and greatest, and each of these areas could use a ton of testing. Our goals are to make editing posts with links more intuitive, make widgets easier for new users and more convenient for existing ones, and get many more people aware of and attending our community events.

Four point eight is here

 Small changes with a big punch

 Big ones come later|||
