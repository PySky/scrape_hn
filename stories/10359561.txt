BOSTON, Oct. 09, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LogMeIn, Inc. (Nasdaq:LOGM) today announced that it has agreed to acquire LastPass (incorporated as Marvasol, Inc.), the popular single-sign-on (SSO) and password management service.  A high growth business with millions of loyal users and an award winning product line, LastPass will immediately bolster LogMeIn’s position in the multi-billion dollar identity and access management (IAM) market, while accelerating one of the company’s key strategic growth initiatives. The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks.



The future identity market is being shaped by realities that come from end-user driven adoption of cloud, web and mobile apps – the bring-your-own-app (BYOA) trend -- and increasingly decentralized approaches to managing identity in the workplace.   Seventy (70) percent of companies report using employee-introduced applications (as opposed to IT introduced and company procured applications) in the workplace.1  This is especially relevant to IT professionals and businesses since eighty (80) percent of cloud applications and services contain sensitive regulated or company confidential data.2 Meanwhile, approximately two-thirds (64 percent) of internet users use the same passwords for most or all websites.3

LogMeIn is building a product and go-to-market strategy that embraces this BYOA reality and introduces new ways to help individuals and businesses secure access to sensitive information.  The LastPass acquisition is expected to play a key role in this effort, is highly complementary to LogMeIn’s existing identity portfolio, and offers a natural extension to LogMeIn’s leadership position in the access market.

“LastPass has a great business, a beloved and award winning product, millions of loyal users, and thousands of great business customers – they are synonymous with the category,” said Michael Simon, LogMeIn’s Chairman and CEO. “We believe this transaction instantly gives us a market leading position in password management, while also providing a highly favorable foundation for delivering the next generation of identity and access management solutions to individuals, teams and companies.”

Following the close of the deal, LogMeIn plans to bring complementary capabilities of its early identity management investments, including those of Meldium, which it acquired in September 2014, into LastPass.  In the near-term, both the Meldium and LastPass product lines will continue to be supported, with longer-term plans to center around a singular identity management offering based on the LastPass service and brand.

“LogMeIn and LastPass share a great common vision on reshaping identity and access management in ways that not only increase productivity but also improve security for individuals and companies, alike,” said Joe Siegrist, CEO of LastPass. “The striking commonality between our businesses, our products, and cultural DNA make this a great fit for both teams, and we believe a great win for our customers.”

Under the terms of the transaction, LogMeIn will pay $110 million in cash upon close for all outstanding equity interests in LastPass, with up to an additional $15 million in cash payable in contingent payments which are expected to be paid to equity holders and key employees of LastPass upon the achievement of certain milestone and retention targets over the two-year period following the closing of the transaction.

LogMeIn will host a conference call to discuss the details of the transaction at 8:30am ET, today, Friday, October 9, 2015. Details as follows.
