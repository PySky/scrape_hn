Join Brett Kuprel, and see how TensorFlow was used by the artificial intelligence lab and medical school of Stanford to classify skin cancer images. He describes the project steps: from acquiring a dataset, training a deep network, and evaluating of the results. To wrap up, Brett will give his take on the future of skin cancer image classification.
