Prove timestamped existence of a document without trusted third parties.

In most jurisdictions, applying for a patent or proving ownership of copyrighted material involves unpleasant (and wildly expensive) third parties. With Notary, you can prove ownership of information at a given time without revealing the actual information.

Some documents, like property titles, have important consequences linked to changes in the document over time. You can use Notary to prove that a document has existed in an unchanged form. Prove your document did not change by matching your file's cryptographic digest at some future date to the one you stored in the blockchain with Notary.

The bitcoin blockchain is globally distributed and requires proof of work to update. Your submission forever proves the existence of your document in its current state at the time of your submission.

In most of the world, humans are still required to participate in multiple forms of conventional document proof. As reputation and identity become key components of the digital world, the existence of a voluntary alternative will support information privacy and ownership.|||
