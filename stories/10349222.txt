We’ve seen it for years in crowdfunded games spaces. “Wow, did you see that X raised $57,000 for Y?”

“Can you believe G raised $380,000 for H?”

“I can’t believe they released Z in this state after raising $218,000.”

The latter is what we seem to hear the most, especially in the past few weeks. Three prominent undelivered Kickstarter campaigns (though the problem certainly persists beyond that particular site) have been the subject of scrutiny lately.

In the case of a game called Mansion Lord, the creators were able to pocket $30,000 (considerably less, actually, after cuts are taken) to complete the game. They’ve been radio silent for over a year.

The creators of Midora managed to raise over $73,000 to build an action/adventure game. As of this week, they’ve admitted it’s not enough to finish the game and even went so far as to admit they always knew it wouldn’t be enough but didn’t do anything about it.

The very sung story of Unsung Story rings familiar but boasts one of the more bombastic totals to go unfulfilled at over $660,000. A few weeks ago, they released a timeline (at least that’s a start) for their release, but curiously, it was full of features not initially discussed.

It’s almost unfair to single these campaigns out because it has happened so many times to other projects. I am not writing to rail against Kickstarter or crowdfunding in general. In fact, I’m very much on the side of developers releasing things when they’re ready. I’m a developer myself who has hit deadlines, missed deadlines, been straight up wrong about budget estimates, been miraculously close on budgets, etc.

I’m here to talk to developers who might have failed in the crowdfunding world and want to work their way up to deliver on the promise of projects many others believe in.

Your game can have life after running out of your crowdfunded cash, but make sure you’re ready for that uphill climb to delivering your final product.|||
