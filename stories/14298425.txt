There is a rising trend in the last years to view sales and marketing activities more closely related to each other. Closer than ever before. Usually, these two sectors of a business have worked in completely different tasks, resulting in constant conflicts between each other. Sales teams often complained about low-quality leads provided by marketing teams and marketing teams complained about sales teams blowing off important deal opportunities provided by them. According to a study by Hubspot, only 5% of sales people considered the leads coming from marketing activities to be high-quality, while only 22% considered marketing leads to be the most relevant. Nonetheless, this is starting to change for both small start-ups and larger businesses too.

Since the arrival of digital technologies and the online branch of businesses, sales and marketing teams have been working closely together and collaborating in the lead generation process. This gave birth to the term smarketing, a new trend in businesses that are characterized by a clear alignment between both sectors. One of the top priorities of marketing teams is to generate sales-ready leads. According to BrightTalk at least half of the marketing budget is usually invested in this specific goal. Thus, it is of significant importance for marketing and sales teams to collaborate step by step in the lead generation process. Marketo reveals in a study that companies where marketing and sales are aligned have a 67% higher chance of closing deals successfully. Diverse digital technologies, as well as online channels such as social media and techniques such as content marketing, have popularized inbound marketing campaigns that result in automated lead generation. Such leads are normally followed carefully by both the marketing and sales team along the whole sales funnels and addressed by the respective team at the respective moment. In this way, deals can be closed more effectively. But what other advantages does smarketing have? Why is it turning so popular and how can it be implemented?
