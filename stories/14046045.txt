Do you find it nearly impossible to track all of your split tests when you have hundreds of ads in your account?

Your not alone, but there is an easier way..

Russell Savage wrote a split testing script back in 2013 that allowed you to track split tests automatically, but  due to Googles recent updates that removed the old text ad format it has no longer worked as effectively.

Well that was until today!

I have now updated the script so that it will work with the new expanded text ad format.

This script will monitor your AdGroups for creative tests that have hit statistical significance and notify you with an email so that you can take action.

The script keeps track of changes to any AdGroups so that it always knows when a new test has started without you having to keep track. It applies labels to your Ads and then notifies you via email when the tests have completed.

You can access the updated version of the script below.

You can change the following variables at the top of the script:

Copy and paste the script into your account and set it to run daily.|||
