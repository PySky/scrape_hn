Hello, dear friends. We present to you today release v1.3 of Gobot, our Golang framework for programming devices in the real world.

We've been very busy at conferences like SCaLE 15x over the last month since the big Golang birthday bash, but thanks to our hard-working team and contributors we're so very happy to present to you our latest and greatest.

Inspired by lots of activity around the BBC Microbit in the kids programming world, we now have support for this friendly Bluetooth LE connected microcontroller.

Here is an example that uses the built-in LEDs to display "Hello" then a smile:

The Gobot interface uses the cool Microbit firmware created by @sandeepmistry we are able to use the Microbit's BLE interface to access some of the built-in capabilities.

Thanks to contributor @thetooth we now have support for the DragonBoard using the GPIO and I2C interfaces. Thank you!

Thanks to contributor @erkkah we have more work on the the Gobot I2C implementations, alongside a couple of new I2C devices:

We've also released Gort v0.8.0 to support the Microbit, along with a couple other updates.

We've switched our code coverage to an awesome new free service codecov.io and worked on upping our coverage based on the more realistic numbers.

The code coverage dashboard for Gobot is located at https://codecov.io/gh/hybridgroup/gobot

Now, the areas where we need work:

So, if you ever wanted to help out, dear reader, that would be a greatly appreciated place to pitch in.
