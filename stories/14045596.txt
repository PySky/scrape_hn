More than a month ago I reported to Google a weird behaviour that I detected while uploading a picture to Google Docs. I was working on a script to upload pictures and attach them to documents when I made a mistake while sending the document ID and the API kept the request waiting for about 3 minutes to end up sending back an internal server error after a weird four-way handshake.

This behaviourÂ made me think Google Docs would be trying to find the document and since it was unable to find it in any sort of recently used documents, the request was forwarded to another subsystem for long term storage. Another possible option was that since the document was not in the DB index it was performing a full-scan.

After try some

where it is more easy to perform the poss

. These endpoints keep the client waiting for 4 mins instead of 3

And this is what happens when you use ApacheBenchmark to test the docs.google.com URL:

As you can see from the ab results, on this case all the 10 requests are taking 4 mins.

Other times some requests are resolved in ms, this was a bit disconcerting to me, making me think that this could be caused by any sort of rate limiter. In order to verify that this was not the case I run the same request from a server that had never execute a request like this being the result the same 4 mins as before. After this, I think that the most plausible explanation is that there is a crash report system or any other sort of logs collector trying to get information from the document that ends up timing out.|||
