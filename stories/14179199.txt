What is the Business Model behind Depression Treatment?

Or is there even a slight amount of money to be made by Health Care Companies / Hospitals / Doctors by Depression Treatment?

No!  This is not some crappy health tips post!  This is the BADA-BAAP / Grandfather of all the business models examples that you could ever have heard or read about.  So Grab a cup of coffee/beer and sit with your reading glasses on, because this is gonna be one hell of a read that you have had lately (and 30 minutes long read as well).

I finished my last read which was an awesome business strategy book named Understanding Michael Porter, the tools required for the understanding of the industry that this book gave was fabulous!  A must read!  So post this I was looking for my next read for which I needed something that gives me a broader perspective of the HIDDEN business value in an industry (something I call in my own train of thought patterns as BASTARDIZATION of the Business Model, more explanation later in this post as well) and this is when I uncovered a truly Unique, Ruthless & powerful, even more than the Prostitution & Begging Industry, Business Model……

Yes, You did get that right!

It’s the Depression Treatment Industry!    Let’s get on to its business model now.|||
