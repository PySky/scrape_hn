There are a few important conclusions from this report. The first is that even when controlling for the large percentage of men in the tech industry—and thus our candidate base—women remain vastly underrepresented in the interview pool. Combine this with the fact that women are offered less money for the same role at the same company 63% of the time and it confirms a stark and sobering truth: women face a one-two punch of bias and wage inequality. They struggle to make it into the consideration set at the same rate as men, and even when they do, they are being paid less than their male peers. While unequal treatment of women in the workplace is not a new issue—and has, in fact, received more attention as a result of recent, highly publicized events in the tech industry—it’s a disturbing trend nonetheless. The extent of this problem is underscored when you consider this is happening to women whose skills are in extremely short supply and who work in an industry lauded as forward-thinking on social issues. At Hired, we take a long-term view on these issues. While we’re frustrated that some of the key figures in this report have only improved slightly since we first looked at the data a year ago, we know that things like diversity and gender inequality simply can’t be solved overnight, nor can they be adequately understood through numbers and charts alone. We hope this report can be a starting point for larger discussions, and a call to action for everyone involved. These are hard problems without easy answers, but measurement and acknowledgment are first steps. Through reports like these, awareness campaigns and product features that aim to reduce bias and educate all candidates and companies, we remain committed to highlighting, quantifying, and speaking out about this issue. We hope you’ll join us.|||
