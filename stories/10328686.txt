Add asynchronous queuing to your HTTP requests with one line, via a controller concern.

Many requests (reports, admin requests, data dumps,) often take longer than a typical HTTP timeout, and it is quite tedious to have to queue things up. The code looks identical to a normal page request, the only difference is that it's expected to take a longer time to execute. Right now, you are forced to package things up into ActiveJob or other queuing mechanisms manually, and there's lots of duplicated code.

It should be easy to switch between a queued request and a normal synchronous HTTP request.

Most existing solutions encourage you to package up your request as an ActiveJob or similar, and then do a bunch of boilerplate work to unwrap things and show your request.

Rather than tediously rewriting your controller method as a background job, just add this gem and one statement and it will get packaged up as a background job and will run when it's completed.

NOTE: This will not work and cause bad things to happen if you try to use the default inline ActiveJob provider

DelayedAction intercepts calls to actions you specify. If it finds one, it queues up a request to a job which will run the action on a job queue. It then redirects to your page, with the UUID of the result.

The request runs on the thread that services the ActiveJob queue, not the web thread.

If it sees the UUID on the querystring, it loads the resulting HTML from the database.

It uses to call your functions, and passes on most of the cookies and environment variables to the request so it can be authenticated.

Don't use ActiveJob's default (ActiveJobInline) as this will probably cause a deadlock. Queues need to run out of process.

All of your requests are stored in the DelayedActionResults table. This could get large, and there's no cleanup functionality currently. You have to clean it up yourself

You need to think about security.

It only currently works on GET requests (not POST etc)
