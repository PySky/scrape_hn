The average price for an Airbnb accommodation in Berlin is 55 Euros per night (at the given minimum occupancy), which is significantly below the average price of around 80 Euros for a hotel room in Berlin. Therefore it is no surprise that many visitors rely on private offers, especially since they are frequently located in the more “hipper” neighbourhoods. Overall, about 60% of all offers are cheaper than 55 Euros. The price level of Airbnb offers in Berlin in relatively low in comparison with other cities. And still, it means profitable business for landlords. If all Airbnb offers in Berlin were rented at the same time, this would amount to a daily revenue of 645 000 Euros.

A comparison of the pricing in Berlin with that of other German cities shows a relatively homogeneous picture. The percentage of apartments per price segment is very similar in Hamburg, Cologne and Frankfurt. While there are a few lower-price offers in Berlin, most accommodations in all of the four cities cost slightly less than 50 Euros. Consequently, the average price is almost the same in all four cities.

The only exception is Munich, the third largest city in Germany, where the number of high-priced offers is significantly higher. Thus it comes as no surprise that the average price of 71 Euros in Munich is considerably above the 55 to 60 Euros that landlords charge in the five other cities examined.|||

But are they contributing to a shortage in affordable housing? This question has sparked a vivid debate and has polarized opinions. But who is right? A look at the data provides valuable insights.
