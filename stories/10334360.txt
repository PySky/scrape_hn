The change in Microsoft's rhetoric regarding Linux has been clear even since the new CEO, Satya Nadella, took the place of the Linux-hater Steve Balmer, and now we're witnessing the impossible. Microsoft recommends Linux on Twitter.

If someone were to say just a couple of years ago that we would see Microsoft officially recommending Linux and Ubuntu as the best operating system for cloud environment, we would have called them crazy, there's no doubt about it. Oh, how the things have changed!

Microsoft policy is now a little bit more focused, and the company is not trying to be the best at everything. Apparently, they can admit just fine that Ubuntu is simply the best when it comes to cloud environments (technically, they are saying that it's the most popular Linux OS for the cloud, but who are they kidding?)

It will take some time until they have the will and the power to do the same thing for servers and desktop, but we're getting there. Now, even if Microsoft does seem a little bit more friendly, and it's even using Ubuntu on stage during a launch, it doesn't mean that it won't fight tooth and nails to keep and expand the present market share.

For now, Microsoft realizes that Ubuntu is simply the best solution for them, and they are inviting people to use that operating system for their cloud needs.

"Ubuntu Server 15.04 (amd64 20150909) for Microsoft Azure. Ubuntu Server is the world's most popular Linux for cloud environments. Updates and patches for Ubuntu 15.04 will be available until 2016-01-23. Ubuntu Server is the perfect platform for all workloads from web applications to NoSQL databases and Hadoop," reads the official Marketplace entry. This is a big step for Microsoft, besides that interesting tweet.

For the moment, Microsoft is riding the wave, so we'll see where this will lead or how far this new partnership will extend.|||
