A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a group of nodes where each node point to the next node by means of a pointer. Each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. The principal benefits of a linked list over a conventional array are â€“

On the other hand, simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data, or any form of efficient indexing. Thus, many basic operations â€” such as obtaining the last node of the list, or finding a node that contains a given data, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted â€” may require sequential scanning of most or all of the list elements.
