Don't click that Google Docs link someone just shared with you - it could be malware

If you received an email from someone in your contacts list today in which the sender appeared to be sharing a Google Doc with you, don't click it — it could be malware or a phishing scam.

The email appears innocuous enough; the subject line reads that someone you likely know "has shared a document on Google Docs with you." However, if you click "Open in Docs," you're redirected to a page where you're asked to enter in — yep, you guessed it — your password.

Some reports say that in addition to opening up your own Google Drive to malware, clicking the blue button also sends the same email to your entire inbox, from you.

Google has addressed the scam, calling it a "phishing email" and saying they are investigating the problem.

New York Times writer Zeynep Tufekci writes that Google has "revoked the app" to keep the spam from spreading further, but if you were one of the unfortunate recipients who was already swindled and clicked on the link, there is something you can do.

As Motherboard reports, those possibly hacked should go to their Google Account page (which is at https://myaccount.google.com/permissions), and then take a look at what apps to which they've granted permissions.

The "Google Docs" app — which should show a recent authorization time — is the phishing app. Once located, click remove.
