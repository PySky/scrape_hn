YouMacro uses macros to automate online tasks. 



 Dragging and dropping video links triggers our video download macro. It automatically figures out the settings to download the best quality video or vlog.



 Double-clicking on a macro makes it run. YouMacro comes with a number of pre-made macros. For example, there are macros to download the latest videos by YouTube vloggers and Vimeo creators.



 You can also create your own macros to perform custom logic and execute actions online. Check your social media accounts and bank account balances. Turn on your smart lights and appliances under various conditions. You can even perform simple scraping of text, images, and videos from web pages.

Macros are created through a visual interface called a node graph. You simply add nodes and link them together. The links indicate the direction of data flow from one node to another. Each node operates on the data flowing into it through the links. For example, the "Download Videos" node will download all the video elements flowing into it. 



 The node graph framework allows us to capture more of the semantic meaning and intent behind each action we want to perform in the browser. We can identify elements based solely on their semantic meaning, such as its text content, and its relation to nearby elements on the web page. There are a number of nodes which can constrain the elements by proximity and distance. Because of this, we can build fairly robust macros which work even when the web page changes its underlying implementation (such as an element's XPath, CSS, or ID).|||
