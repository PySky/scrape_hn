Here are the top five articles I've picked out to understand some of the nuances of race in the American context -- a large span of broken mythology that has divided the nation since its inception. Would love to add more to the list:

The Price of Union 

 "The Union may have been victorious in battle, but American politics has been Southernized."

The Lives of Poor White People 

 "White poverty, Vance comes to feel, is a source of special shame: no one at Yale sees dignity in it."

The Two Asian Americans 

 "In the eyes of some, Asians in America are, Lee writes, “perpetual foreigners at worst, or probationary Americans at best.”"

A Dream Undone 

 "Inside the 50-year campaign to roll back the Voting Rights Act."

The Case for Reparations 

 "Two hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jim Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal. Thirty-five years of racist housing policy. Until we reckon with our compounding moral debts, America will never be whole."|||
