Sentry and SessionStack partner to offer full context to replicate and debug issues.

Sentry’s error tracking helps you log issues in web and mobile apps. With Sentry you can:

Sentry tracks errors in all major languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby.

SessionStack will re-create the user actions that led to an error and take the guesswork out of debugging for you. It will be continuously collecting details about all user actions, UI changes, page loads and browser info in the background while your web app is running. When your application crashes SessionStack will immediately notify you. It will recreate the collected user data as a video for you to see how the user got the error, complemented with a timeline with the stack traces of JavaScript errors, details of failed network requests and debug messages that came up during the user session.

Integrating SessionStack is as simple as placing a lightweight JavaScript snippet in your web app (single-page applications including). SessionStack works on any web app regardless of what platform, framework or language you use.

Sentry and SessionStack partnered to offer full-blown context around how an error occurred. The two solutions now integrate to help you speed up debugging and focus on what you like doing: coding. If you are a Sentry user now you can complement your error reports with SessionStack’s visual recreation of user actions for every single issue in your web app. All you need to do to get going with it is follow the four simple steps below to integrate your Sentry project with SessionStack.

This is where the SessionStack user session recording can be found in your Sentry account

Are you a Sentry user? Here’s how to take advantage of this integration:

Step 1: Go register a free SessionStack account and add your web app.

Step 2: To integrate SessionStack, add the JavaScript snippet in the head element of your web app. An additional snippet will be needed to associate each Sentry event with its respective SessionStack user session at the correct time.

Step 3: Create a SessionStack API token which will be used in the next step to setup the integration from within your Sentry account.

Step 4: Find the SessionStack plugin in your Sentry project settings and click on Configure plugin. Enter your SessionStack account email, the API Token you just created and the ID of the website.

That’s it! Now you’ll find the SessionStack play session button in your Sentry error reports.

The video will start playing 5 seconds before the event has occurred so you can see the user actions that lead to the error. This is the basic integration.
