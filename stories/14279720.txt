97c is not really going to buy much these daysâ€¦ Unless you want a monthâ€™s worth of quality SSD web hosting.

We have been running web hosts (and still do) since 1996 and every one of our businesses is still running profitably with many happy subscribers!

Recently there has been a dramatic increase of fly by night operators offering dirt cheap hosting with huge limits. The reality is their business model will never work. Servers will be overloaded and slow, and eventually the host will disappear once they realise their mistake.

97cents.net is here to serve those who just need some simple, no frills hosting with limits suitable to an average business website, personal website or wordpress blog.

Need unlimited storage with unlimited bandwidth? Stop here, close this site and donâ€™t come back!

Lets keep it simple ðŸ™‚ we offer a reliable hosting service for pocket change by automating most processes. You will be sent your cPanel login details within seconds of making payment. Should you require assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to open a ticket.|||

Reliable SSD web hosting for only 97c per month
