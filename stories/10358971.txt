“With the Azendoo app, I can see what everybody is working on, in real-time. It works like my dashboard where I can focus on the workflow, without having to ask anyone to brief me. Not disturbing my team with micro-requests had an overall positive effect on productivity.”

“The Analytics dashboard is a real necessity for a firm like Argolight, where we use Azendoo for production, R&D and management. Detecting the points of difficulty, and the bottlenecks that block the work we do as a team, enables us to progress faster and to remove any obstacles before they compromise our growth.”

“Azendoo allows us to actually have team meetings without going over projects. That’s what we wanted to do; we want to talk about design, and new ideas, but we don’t want to be talking about, ‘Did you do this? Did you do that?’ in a meeting. I don’t think it’s right, and Azendoo has very quickly started to take that away for us, which is fantastic.”|||
