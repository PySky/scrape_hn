Last weekend I was playing around with a way to represent null-terminated UTF8 strings in Rust. Rather than just toying with it forever, I decided to clean up a minimal version and publish it to crates.io. Creating the crate went smoothly, exactly the same as the 11 prior crates I’ve published. I closed up my laptop and called it a day.

Well, everything only seemed the same until an hour later when I got this tweet:

The crate I had just published was named , after the null terminator character which is abbreviated as . I hopped onto Rust’s IRC channel to figure out what I had done, and the friendly Rust devs informed me that they were going to delete from crates.io.

While trying to catch up at this point, I saw that there was an issue filed on my repo. And an issue filed on cargo. And a reddit thread. Whoops.

Whenever any users on Windows attempted to download new crates or update their dependencies, they were greeted with this error:

As kmc described the status of cargo on Windows:

Turns out that “NUL” (including “nul”) is a reserved filename on Windows. is the Windows equivalent of Unix’s , but instead of existing at a specific directory you can write to in any directory, and even with any extension!

That might sound surprising, but Raymond Chen has an illuminating explanation:

And so, since these DOS 1.0 days, tons of batch files exist on Windows redirecting with , and the reserved filenames remain.

Once my crate was deleted, Windows users were back in business. The Rust team quickly moved to prevent this issue from happening again by adding “NUL” and Windows’ 21 other reserved filenames to the list of reserved crate names. Guess I won’t get to publish that crate now 😉

Apologies to Carol Nichols and any other Rust devs whose weekends I interrupted, thanks for your quick action!
