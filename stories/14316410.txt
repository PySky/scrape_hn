This List consists of DNS Violation Entries (DVE's) that describes known violations to the DNS protocol by implementations, software and/or systems.

The purpose of the List is to better understand how wrongfully the DNS protocol is used out in the wild in order to try and make it better. There is also a great gain for implementers to verify that they can handle wrong DNS correctly.

The List is driven by the community for the community, anyone can send in a violation and a team of community members will review and accept or reject the violation, this team in called Maintainers. Anyone can request to join the Maintainers team and <acceptance method TBD>.

An implementation, software and/or system is considered to be in violation to the DNS protocol when it does not strongly conform to the current DNS RFCs. Violations can also include updated or obsolete DNS RFCs.

Anyone can submit a DNS violation and request a DVE, this is done as a pull request or an issue. If submitted as a markdown file, add it under the year directory and with the full filename.

The format is Markdown with the following suggested headers, which are not strict but should at least have short and long description. Metadata may be included at the end of headers, together under header or at the end of the file.

You may attach files to the DVE by using the section and add the files in a directory related to the DVE as (from repository root) .

DVE are allocated sequentially starting from the number 1 using the format . The number is allocated on a first-come-first-served bases via pull requests or by the Maintainers for an issue. The Maintainers may reserve a number for an issue by updated the title of the issue with the full DVE and also add a comment addressed to that it has been reserved. Collisions are rejected/asked to be updated.|||
