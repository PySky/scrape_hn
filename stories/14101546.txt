CloudCoreo was built to enable operational efficiency and control over defining, deploying and maintaining your cloud infrastructure.

In our model-driven approach, we focused on organizational sharing and re-use by creating inheritable cloud reference designs called Composites. Composites can be leveraged as-is or extended without breaking the connection to a base policy, making it easy for teams to layer and distribute changes across running cloud infrastructure.|||
