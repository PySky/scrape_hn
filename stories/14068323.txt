It has been reported that Walmart acquired the Shoes.com domain name and has plans to utilize the domain name as an independent brand. What I haven’t seen reported anywhere is the price Walmart paid to acquired Shoes.com.

This afternoon, George Kirikos helped me uncover what appears to be the sale price that Walmart paid to acquire the Shoes.com domain name, associated domain names, and related intellectual property. According to a pdf of a court filing I found on the Alvarez & Marsal website, Walmart bid $9 million for the “Shoes.com Technologies domain names and intellectual property.”

George Kirikos compiled several associated filings on his website. As George wrote, “After reading the above, one can see Walmart paid USD $9 million for the shoes.com domain name, plus minor related assets (social media accounts, lower quality domain names, and some trademark registrations.”

This deal includes more than just the Shoes.com domain name. The other assets included in the sale are likely much less valuable, but I don’t think it can be recorded as a pure domain name sale.

It is great to see a company like Walmart operating a descriptive keyword domain name like Shoes.com. It will be interesting to see how Walmart grows this brand and how much marketing Walmart puts behind the brand.

Thanks to George for his help in uncovering what appears to be the price Walmart paid for Shoes.com and associated IP.|||
