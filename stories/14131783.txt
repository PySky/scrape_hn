A geosocial footprint is the combined bits of location information that a user divulges through social media, which ultimately forms the users location "footprint". For Twitter.com users, this footprint is created from GPS enabled tweets, social check-ins, natural language location searching (geocoding), and profile harvesting.

This website provides twitter users with an opportunity to view their geosocial footprint. In addition, it informs users of some potential areas of concern with their current sharing habits. To begin, enter your Twitter.com username in the input box below and press "Retrieve Tweets".
