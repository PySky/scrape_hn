Cisco Systems has patched a critical flaw that even novice hackers could exploit using Central Intelligence Agency attack tools that were recently leaked to the Internet.

A simple command allows the CIA to commandeer 318 models of Cisco switches As previously reported, the zero-day exploit allowed attackers to issue commands that remotely execute malicious code on 318 models of Cisco switches. The attack code was published in early March by WikiLeaks as part of its Vault7 series of leaks, which the site is billing as the largest publication of intelligence documents ever.

The bug resides in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP), which uses the telnet protocol to deliver signals and commands on internal networks. It stems from a failure to restrict telnet options to local communications and the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-only telnet options.

"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections," company officials wrote in an advisory updated on Monday. "An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device."

Cisco officials gave CVE-2017-3881, as the vulnerability was designated, a score of 9.8 based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, a rating scale with a maximum score of 10.|||

Fix neutralizes attack code that was put into the wild in early March.
