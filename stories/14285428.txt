Oakland could become the next community in California to adopt an open and rigorous vetting process for police surveillance technology.

All too often, government executives unilaterally decide to adopt powerful new surveillance technologies that invade our privacy, chill our free speech, and unfairly burden communities of color. These intrusive and proliferating tools of street-level surveillance include drones, cell-site simulators, surveillance cameras, and automated license plate readers.

On Tuesday, Oakland’s Public Safety Committee will vote on the “Surveillance and Community Safety Ordinance,” a breakthrough slate of transparency requirements drafted by the city’s two-year-old Privacy Advisory Commission. EFF strongly supports these reforms. We sent a letter backing the ordinance last week, and we testified before the Privacy Commission earlier this year.

EFF commends Oakland Privacy for leading this critical effort in Oakland. EFF has supported similar efforts for Santa Clara County, BART, and Palo Alto.

If you live in California, email your state legislator to support S.B. 21, a similar bill that would mandate, on a statewide basis, community control of police surveillance technology.|||
