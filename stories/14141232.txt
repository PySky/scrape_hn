Here are some of the best projects from our fourth Foo Week.

Hipmunk is known for the unique way in which it sorts its flight results, by agony. Agony is determined by combination of price, number of stops, amenities, and many other things. But what if you could tune it to your exact personal preferences? Maybe you care more about certain airlines or maybe you really prefer flights that depart in the morning. With custom agony, you can specify what's most important to you so Hipmunk always recommends you the perfect flights.

It's the day before your vacation and you realize you need to look up the address to your hotel. So what do you do? You search through your never-ending inbox for your booking receipt and hope it's got what you need. Here's a better way. This experimental feature will allow you to add your reservation to your calendar so it's easily retrievable. Even better, it'll send you a notification the day before your trip so your hotel details are just a tap away.

Do you love travel trivia? Well then meet Hello Hipmunk, your new best friend. In addition to being a one stop shop for finding the best flights and hotels, now your AI-powered travel assistant can quiz you on your travel knowledge. See how you fare and then share it with your friends and see who knows more.
