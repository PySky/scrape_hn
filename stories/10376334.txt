We are proud to announce the release of Node.js v4.2.0 "Argon", the first release covered under the new Long Term Support plan!

As an LTS release, support for v4.x will continue for a period of 30 months from today. This means that individuals and businesses building on Node.js will have a stable and supported platform on which to grow. For more details on what LTS means for Node.js, see Rod Vagg's blog post.

To better differentiate LTS releases from regular Node.js releases, we have introduced a naming convention based on the Periodic Table of Elements that applies only to LTS releases. The name selected for v4.2.0 is "Argon", so as to be in alphabetical order by the first letter.

Developers can easily determine if they are working with an LTS version of Node.js by checking the property within node. This property will be undefined in regular releases.

The first Node.js LTS release! See https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/ for details of the LTS process.
