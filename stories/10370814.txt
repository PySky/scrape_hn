After you configure the AWS IoT Button to connect to your Wi-Fi network and provision the button with an AWS IoT certificate and private key, the button will securely connect to AWS IoT and publish a message on a topic when clicked. You can use the AWS IoT rules engine to set up a rule and configure single-click, double-click, or long-press events to be routed to any AWS service. You can configure it to send you a notification through Amazon SNS or store the clicks in an Amazon DynamoDB table. You can even code custom logic written in Node.js, Python, or Java in an AWS Lambda function, and then configure the function to connect to third-party services or other AWS IoT-powered connected things.
