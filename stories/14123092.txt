SCUMM-8 is a PICO-8 "demake" of the SCUMM engine that powered most of the classic LucasArts adventure games, such as Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. However, it is only (heavily) "inspired" by the SCUMM engine, not a true replica - for that you'll want good ol' SCUMM-VM.

My plan/hope is to make it possible for anyone to make their own point & click adventure games in PICO-8!

 Multiple Rooms (up to 32, technically)

  Pathfinding for walking

  Dialogs between Actors

  Cut-scenes

  Camera system (pan-to, follow, static)

  Room transitions ("iris", cut)

  Customisable Verbs

  Z-plane ordering of objects/actors

  Global-level (background) & Room-level scripts

  Game start-up script

  Object dependencies

  Replace Color (to allow re-use of room/object gfx)

  Adjustable Room Brightness Levels

  Screen "shake" effect

  Proximity (between Actors/Objects)

 Further compression of engine/game definition code

 (as the engine takes WAY more tokens/size than planned!)

  Separate cart for creating/editing levels (if possible - depends on point above)

  Save/Load support (when space allows)

  More on GitHub...

All the code is on GitHub.

The above "game" is just a silly demo that I created as part of testing the engine. Unfortunately, due to the large size of the engine + game code, it had to be "minified" to allow posting to the BBS. The original demo game source can be found here.

Please see the SCUMM-8 Wiki for details on how to get started creating your own SCUMM-8 game, as well as the the full API reference.
