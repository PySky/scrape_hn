We are happy to announce the release of Cloudron 0.130.0.

For those unaware, Cloudron is a platform that makes it easy to run apps on your server and keep them up-to-date.

Cloudron will automatically get a new certificate once it has valid DNS credentials (just refresh the browser after a minute).|||
