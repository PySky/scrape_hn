Three startups won $75,000 apiece Tuesday night in Harvard Business School’s annual New Venture Competition.

Veho, an app that allows anyone with a car to deliver packages, won the top prize in the contest’s “business track” category, which requires entrants to have at least one active HBS student as a founder.

The “social enterprise” contest — which focuses on solving social issues and is open to all Harvard graduate students — was won by Flare. The company has developed a wearable device that women can activate to alert emergency contacts if they are in danger.

The alumni competition, which requires one HBS alumnus to be on the company’s executive team, was won by Apli, an autonomous messaging system that helps companies in Latin America fill vacant roles.

The competition, which is judged by panels of venture capitalists, Harvard faculty, and entrepreneurs, celebrated its 20th anniversary this year.

Including runners-up, a total of $315,000 in prize money was awarded.|||
