When working in a Visual Studio 2017 solution I started to get this problem when running sass.js task via task runner explorer.

When googling this problem I found this nice explanation by Ryan Hayes

However I ran into an issue today in which I updated Node.JS outside of Visual Studio, but since VS uses its own install that is separate from any outside installation, you can potentially run into a node_modules package dependency issue where one version of npm installs a package (which makes it rely on that version of Node/npm), and then you can’t run commands in the other version (they break).

Running npm install or npm rebuild node-sass –force, as the error message says, did not help.|||

I started to get Error Missing binding Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment Windows 64-bit with Node.js 4.x. This is how i solved it.
