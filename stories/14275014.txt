A Czech Scout has been praised after she confronted a neo-Nazi at a rally in Brno.

A widely shared photograph shows 16-year-old Lucie Myslíková standing up to a rightwing demonstrator as he gestures angrily.

Lucie was one of a number of Scouts who joined counter-protesters at a May Day rally held by neo-Nazis on Monday in Czech Republic’s second-biggest city.

Czech media quoted a police spokesman as saying the counter-demonstrators outnumbered the 150 or so rightwingers by approximately two to one.

Vladimir Cicmanec, who took the photo of Myslíková, told CNN: “She was standing tall and she’s 16 years old and she stood proud and made some profound arguments.”

Cicmanec, who was part of the counter-demonstration, said: “We wanted to show the neo-Nazis that they are not welcome here. This year the counter-protest was to make fun of and to troll the Nazis.”

The World Organisation of the Scout Movement posted the photograph on its Facebook page with the message: “People from all walks of life, and Scouts among them, came to the streets during an extreme right march yesterday to express their support for values of diversity, peace and understanding. Creating a better world!”

In the last parliamentary elections in Czech Republic in 2013, the far-right Dawn of Direct Democracy party won almost 7% of the vote.|||
