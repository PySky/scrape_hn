Speaking to middle school students at an event encouraging young women to pursue STEM education, Trump said she and her 5-year-old daughter will take a coding class together this summer.

"As a mom, I am trying to do my part, as well. My daughter, Arabella, and I are enrolling in a coding class this summer," Trump said at Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. "We're excited to learn this incredibly important new language together. Coding truly is the language of the future. "

The first daughter made her first formal on-camera remarks since her father took office in a museum theater ahead of a screening of "Hidden Figures," the 2016 Oscar-nominated film that tells the story of three African-American women at NASA that helped launch the first astronauts into orbit.

Trump touted her father's commitment to the space program, expanding NASA's space exploration program and adding Mars as a key objective. She encouraged the young women to pursue careers in STEM fields, asking those in the audience to raise their hands if they were interested science, technology, engineering or math. "Your response fills me with incredible hope. Today's statistics, though, not so much. Women make up 48% of the workforce but only 24% of stem professionals," she said. "I dare you to beat these statistics." On the campaign trail and at her namesake apparel and accessories brand, Trump made women and girls' empowerment a signature issue. She's participated in round table discussions on the topic at the White House and helped establish the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders and Female Entrepreneurs last month, along with her father and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. "Women's participation in STEM, where so many of the jobs of the future will come from, is critical in the fight for wage equality and for the empowerment of women in the economy," she told the students Tuesday.
