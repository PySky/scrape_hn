In addition to remastering the original StarCraft and Brood War expansion in 4K ultra high definition, Blizzard is giving some love to the original version of the game. The company announced it was updating StarCraft: Brood War with new features — and will make the real-time strategy game completely free.

Version 1.18 of StarCraft: Brood War will be released “later this week,” Blizzard said in a release. The update to the 1998 game will include a variety of bug fixes and new features, including the ability to rebind keys and an official observer mode.

The update will also introduce new anti-cheat measures and better compatibility with modern operating systems (namely Windows 7, 8.1 and 10).

Better still, as of version 1.18, the StarCraft Anthology will be completely free to download and play.

Blizzard recently pulled StarCraft Anthology from its online store. Prior to that, the game and its expansion were selling for $14.99.|||

A great excuse to revisit the RTS classic
