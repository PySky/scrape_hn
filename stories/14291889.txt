I share tech events I'm attending or find (conferences, meetups, etc) to so many friends, classmates, coworkers, and peers, I thought, "why not just make it a newsletter? Put all the events in one message!" These are tech events around the Bay Area and also NYC (but mainly the Bay.) They're mainly for attendees, and most are free but if they're looking for speakers or volunteers or cost money, I'll note it. Interesting GitHub repos, tutorials, quotes, and puns may also be included.🤷🏻‍♀️|||
