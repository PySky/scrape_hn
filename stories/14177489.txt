Goby is a Ruby-like object oriented language written in Go. And it's not a new Ruby implementation. Instead, it should be a language that help developer create api server or microservice efficiently.

It will have Ruby's syntax (I'll try to support all common syntaxes) but without most of Ruby's meta-programming magic to make the VM simple. It will also have built in http library that is built upon Go's efficient http package. And I'm planning to do more optimization by using goroutine directly.
