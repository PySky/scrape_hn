Leverage Python's scientific stack for interactive data analysis using Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn etc. As such, xlwings is a free alternative to tools like Power BI or Tableau (Windows & Mac).

Write Excel tools with Python instead of VBA and call your code directly from within Excel, e.g. via a button on the sheet. This also works great for prototyping web apps (Windows & Mac).

Write (array) UDFs in a breeze by taking advantage of all the functionality already available in libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Since v0.10, dynamic array formulas are supported (Windows only).|||
