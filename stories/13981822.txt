This is a database of SHA256 and SHA512 hashes of Apple firmware updates. Extracted from Apple firmware updates and OS updates.

There are no official signatures (yet) available from Apple. This would be a very useful thing for Apple to make available.

I'll keep adding older versions as I'm able to track them.
