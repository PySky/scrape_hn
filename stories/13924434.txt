Infant mortality is considered a basic measure of public health for countries around the world (1–3). Over the past decade, the overall infant mortality rate in the United States has improved, declining 15% from 6.86 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005—a recent high—to 5.82 in 2014 (4). Over the years, many efforts have been made to understand and lower infant mortality (4,5). This report examines the 2014 linked birth/infant death data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) to describe trends in infant mortality in the United States by race and Hispanic origin, state, and leading causes of infant deaths from 2005 through 2014.

1Includes persons of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin.

 NOTES: For “Total” and each race and Hispanic-origin group, the decline in the rate for 2005–2014 is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

NOTES: For each Hispanic-origin subgroup, the decline in the rate from 2005–2007 to 2012–2014 is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

NOTES: SIDS is sudden infant death syndrome. For each cause of death, the change in the rate from 2005 to 2014 is statistically significant (p < 0.05), but the change from 2013 to 2014 is not statistically significant.

From 2005 through 2014, infant mortality declined for all major racial and ethnic groups except among infants of AIAN women. Across all of these years, differences persisted among population subgroups. For 2005–2014, the highest infant mortality rates were observed among infants of non-Hispanic black women, and the lowest rates were observed among infants of API women. Among infants of Hispanic women, infants of Puerto Rican women had the highest infant mortality rates. Declines in infant mortality rates were observed in two-thirds of all U.S. states and D.C. From 2005 through 2014, infant mortality rates declined for four of the five leading causes of death, but there were no significant changes in the rates by cause of death in the past year.

Infant mortality rate: Number of infant (aged under 1 year) deaths per 1,000 live births.

Leading cause of infant death: Ranked according to the number of infant deaths assigned to rankable causes (6).

This report contains data from the period linked birth/infant death data set, which is part of NVSS (7). The period linked birth/infant death data set includes all infant deaths under 1 year of age reported on death certificates and all live births reported from birth certificates (7). The period linked birth/infant death data set is the primary data set for analyzing infant mortality trends and patterns in the United States, and it is the only source for examining race and Hispanic-origin infant mortality and for examining factors related to birth (4,7). For general trend comparisons, 2005, the most recent year in which the infant mortality rate peaked, is used as the starting point. For analysis on Hispanic subgroups and U.S. states, 3 years have been combined for two periods, 2005–2007 and 2012–2014, to allow for statistically robust comparisons over time. Causes of death are classified according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (8). Linked birth/infant death data sets are available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm.

References to increases or decreases in rates indicate that differences are statistically significant at the 0.05 level (7).
