Ubisoft has made it easier to unlock content without paying money in For Honor, rolling out an update that heavily increases the drop rate for the in-game "Steel" used to access new items and abilities.

The update, which launched on Friday, increases the amount of Steel generated by in-game matches, Daily Orders, Side Orders, and Community Orders by anywhere from 25 to 200 percent. All told, Ubisoft estimates the changes will "raise your daily first two hours income by as much as 45 percent."

That increase might seem like a drop in the bucket for a game that previously required about 5,200 hours of gameplay to unlock everything (without paying money, that is). That said, the rebalancing should make it much easier to at least earn some of the pricier cosmetic items and "emotes" for a few preferred character. And as For Honor director Damien Kieken put it in a recent interview, "we never had an intention for you to unlock everything in the game."

The move comes as a group of For Honor players have called off a planned one-day "blackout" of the game. The proposed action was meant to protest the unlockable rate and issues such as matchmaking, balance, and lack of communication from Ubisoft. Members of the For Honor development team addressed many of those issues with a lengthy livestream on Friday, leading the blackout organizers to hold off on their plans. "For the most part our requests and suggestions that have been posted in my thread and similar threads have been met," organizer jbaayoun wrote on Reddit.|||
