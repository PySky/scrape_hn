When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.

Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps. Want to see some examples?

All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTP with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.

Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.

Your project is built with the JAMstack if it meets three key criteria:

Any project that relies on a tight coupling between client and server is not built with the JAMstack. This would include:

A site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace. A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or another backend language. A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on the server at runtime.|||
