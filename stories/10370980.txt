KeyBox generates its own public/private SSH key upon initial startup. This key is placed in the authorized_key file of the registered systems. KeyBox allows you to share terminal commands and upload files to multiple systems simultaneously.

Additional system administrators can be added and their terminal sessions and history audited. Also, KeyBox can manage, distribute, and disable public keys that have been setup within the application. Key management is enabled by default to prevent unmanaged public keys and enforce best practices.

KeyBox layers TLS/SSL on top of SSH and acts as a bastion host for administration. Protocols are stacked (TLS/SSL + SSH) so infrastructure cannot be exposed through tunneling / port forwarding. More details can be found in the following whitepaper: The Security Implications of SSH.|||

KeyBox is an open-source web-based SSH console that centrally manages administrative access to systems. It acts as a bastion host for administrators with features that promote infrastructure security. Web-based administration is combined with management and distribution of user's public SSH keys. Key management and administration is based on profiles assigned to defined users.
