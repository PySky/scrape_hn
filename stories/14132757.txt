In late 2011 when I decided to start working on a commercial mobile toolchain using the Ruby language. I really didn’t expect it to be successful that quickly. It has since been for me a wonderful, challenging, and rewarding journey.

Today, 5 years later, it’s finally time for me to appropriately hand over the baton to someone else. Someone who has the motivation, the knowledge, and the ambition to push RubyMotion forward. I am very happy to announce that Scratchwork Development LLC, Amir Rajan’s own company, has agreed to acquire RubyMotion.

Amir is no stranger in the RubyMotion community. He was an early adopter of the platform, right after leaving his corporate cubicle job, and he has since distributed over 3 million copies of RubyMotion through his very successful Indie games. Amir is one of the most popular and highest earning users of RubyMotion.

Amir has a great vision and profound love for the platform, and I can't wait to see where he takes it. Please join me in welcoming Amir as the new CEO of RubyMotion.

Hello everyone. I just wanted to take a moment to say hello for those that don't know who I am. This Inspect presentation I gave about Meaningful Work should shed some light on what I'm all about. Also, if you're really interested, you can read about my personal history, and how I came to use RubyMotion.

I never in a million years would have dreamed that I'd be a part of such a wonderful product, and I'm excited to make RubyMotion better than it already is. So here are some comments (and plans) for the next couple of months:

After the list above has been completed, more news will come. If you ever want to chat, you can reach out to me here. I'm more than happy to talk about anything (and get feedback on the product if you have any to share).|||
