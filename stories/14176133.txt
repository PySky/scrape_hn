We were all counting the days when we could pledge for the ZX Spectrum Next project, and now that day has come! The Next campaign is live and after a couple hours, it already reached almost £50,000. We are happy to be the first retro computing/gaming website to bring such good news!

The Spectrum Next is an expanded and updated version of the ZX Spectrum, fully compatible (software and hardware) with the original. You can play any games, demos, use original hardware, you name it. And it also runs new software created more recently to make use of expanded hardware, including new graphics modes and faster processor speeds.

There are many pledge levels – If you want just the board, to install in an original ZX Spectrum case, it will cost you £99 (USD130). A fully assembled basic model with 512Mb RAM, HDMI out, 7Mhz, accelerator port and SD card will cost £175 (USD230). There are more expensive models reaching up to £1000 (USD1300).

The machine is fully compatible with the ol’Speccy, but it brings a lot of modern features, like the HDMI port and SD card. Here are the full specifications:

It is always important to remind us all that the Kickstarter campaign is not a pre-sale, and there are risks to any project but, by the history of the project on its Facebook group, it looks like the people behind it are really serious and have the capacity to make it come to fruition.
