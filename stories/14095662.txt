In 2007, the "fluent UI" or ribbon had IP rights asserted and required a license from Microsoft. That license is now no longer available, the page only stating 'retired'.

What is the status of using a ribbon UI on Windows or any other platform? Is Microsoft still asserting IP rights, and is a license required?

Note that there are many questions online about this, but no answer, much less a sourced one stating Microsoft's official position. This leaves many developers in a state of uncertainty.

This leaves all developers who did not sign a license prior to it being retired in limbo and uncertainty, not knowing:

Please cite sources, and prefer the kind of sources you could quote if it became legally important, above sources that are a comment on a forum. I'm seeking a definitive answer, and won't mark a "it's probably ok, you'll get away with it" answer as correct.|||
