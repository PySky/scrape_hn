Get Out opened at more than 2780 theaters, and following the critical acclaim it manages to beat all the previous Box Office predictions. With just $4.5 Million budget Get Out grossed more than $200 Million at the worldwide box office, including $173 Million domestically. Now considered one of the biggest surprises this year, it may get a sequel.

In a recent interview, while celebrating the film’s upcoming DVD and Blu-ray release, Jordan Peele was asked about a possibility of a sequel, and he said:

“I could see it. I’ve thought about it — I’ve put a lot of thought into it,” “Some people want me to do it. I think there’s ways to do it.”

“I can guarantee you one thing. I would never do a sequel unless I knew how it would be better than the first or as good. So that’s going to be tough, but I’m not gonna shortchange it. I’m not gonna do some bulls-sequel.”

Get Out ranks now among the best movies this year, and considered by Indiewire the best of 2017 so far.|||
