Running a company requires very few tools and services, however there are quite a few that do make things much easier and faster.

We get asked regularly what tools we use for various tasks, so below we’ve listed out all the tools and services we as a company (and individually) use to make the magic happen here at Baremetrics.

One interesting thing I noticed while putting all of this together is that the large majority of these we pay for…we use basically zero free tools. That’s important to note because as a business, we choose to use tools that actually make a difference in our daily workflow. Free tools rarely do that…otherwise they’d be able to charge for it.

On top of that, nearly the majority of these we pay $50/mo+ for. If you build anything for businesses, you should be charging for it and you should be solving a big enough problem that you can actually pull off charging $50/mo+. If you can't get anyone to pay at least that, you’re probably not solving a big enough pain point.

But I digress! On with the listing…

Side note: If Product Hunt is your jam, here's a Collection with nearly all of these tools.

So, what about you? What tools are indespensible for you and your business?|||
