Next, to change the port that SQL Server is listening on to 3000, I ran the following command

Then I ran  netstat -tulpn | grep sqlservr again and as you can see the output now has 3000 as the port number

As you can see, this worked and I could connect to SQL Server listening on port 3000 when supplying that to the sqlcmd command

You want to learn a little more?

We used tulpn as options in our netstat command. So what do all these options do?

Show the PID (process identifier) and name of the program to which each socket belongs. Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names. On a Linux system to get help for a command, use man, this will bring up the user manual for that command So if you run man netstat, you will see the following (I only pasted 1 page here, there are more)  Manual page netstat(8) line 1/348 15% (press h for help or q to quit)

I restarted SQL Server bu running the commandNow I tried using sqlcmd, I ran the followingI got an timeout errorFinally I ran the sqlcmd command again but I added port number 3000, like this|||
