Scala client for logging Hacker News karma (for a user) and score (for his submissions)

###Why I wanted to track changes in my Hacker News karma over time.

###Why Scala I learnt Scala some time back but never got to develop anything using it. This would be my first step in that direction.

###How to use it Pretty straight-forward. Import the project into any IDE and run Main.scala. Ohh and do not forget to copy config.sample.conf to config.conf and populate the fields.

###What excatly is it doing It picks a username from config.conf, then its fetchs the submissions for that user from the Hacker News API.|||
