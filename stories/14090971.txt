Instead of a simple integer index, we may specify a range instead in which case a column of the same type containing the elements in the specified range is returned.

This feature can be used in other contexts as well. So for example, we can use the size operator to count the number of such months.

The syntax of Xtal is close to the C family of languages than Tcl. Thus unquoted identifiers are variables, not strings, and do not need a prefix as in Tcl and expressions use the usual infix form.

String literals can be expressed in two forms - surrounded by double quotes or by single quotes. In the former case, variable and command substitutions are performed as in Tcl. In the latter case, no variable or command substitutions are done.

An important feature of Xtal is that, being built on top of Tcl, it can be freely intermixed with it. This allows use of the syntax that is most suitable for the task at hand.

Many of the operators we saw earlier with columns and tables can also be used with lists. This can be more convenient than the corresponding Tcl command.

The lookup postfix operator used with dictionaries can also be used with columns. In this case, it returns the index of the first matching element.

That ends our quick tour of the basic. Xtal has other advanced features as well as standard programming language constructs such as control structures and built-in functions that we have left out in our quick tour.|||
