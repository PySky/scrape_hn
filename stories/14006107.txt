Holland is one of the greatest countries to live in, but the biggest downside is that it rains 145 days a year. That’s why the Google Cloud Platform team in the Netherlands is launching Google Wind this Spring. 



We leveraged existing Dutch infrastructure to realize this moonshot in record time. We upgraded some historical windmills in Holland with control modules connected to Google Cloud Platform. Google Wind then uses Machine Learning to recognize cloud patterns and orchestrate the network of windmills when rain is approaching. Test results look very promising.



We’re proud to announce that from April 1st we’re able to help ensure clear skies for everyone in Holland.
