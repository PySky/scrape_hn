Kubernetes, the open-source system for managing Docker and Rkt containers across private, public, and hybrid cloud environments, grows every more popular. So, it's no surprise that Red Hat, with its intention to become a cloud power, is embracing OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.

Red Hat wants to help you manage your cloud containers with Kubernetes in OpenShift Container.

In this update, Red Hat provides an enterprise-ready container platform based on Kubernetes 1.5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and the integrated Docker container runtime through the latest version of Red Hat's container application platform. This isn't the newest version of Kubernetes; that's the piping hot Kubernetes 1.6, which was released in late March.

OpenShift Container isn't just about Kubernetes and containers. OpenShift, which is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud, together with OpenShift Container, is designed to provide companies with a single, streamlined way to manage both "legacy" and containerized applications.

Taken all-together, this update is meant for developers porting old software to the cloud and creating new cloud-based programs.

This new version of OpenShift Container also boasts better container security. It does this with:

All-in-all, this release strikes me as perfect for anyone deploying applications to a RHEL-based cloud. You can see it for yourself. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 is available now via the Red Hat Customer Portal.
