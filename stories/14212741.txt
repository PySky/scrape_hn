On this very first post, I want to explore the Facebook Live UI. Facebook Live is a basic feature that offers live-streaming video capabilities to users. Watchers can also add reaction to the video.

I use GreenSock TweenMax to control the animation timeline. If you’re not familiar with TweenMax, you can learn here https://greensock.com/learning.

So, before we can actually interact with the emoji buttons, we need to load the video first. Upon loading, I transformed the video form to be look this the image below. It will be animated to its prior form when the class active is added.

Now we can assume that our video is loaded, it’s time to reveal the emojis. We will need a few steps to do this. Keep in mind, this animation is running by TweenMax.

The pop in effect has 10 lines/bar. The is rotated 36deg, the next element has doubled value. This will form the asterisk symbol. To animate the , we simply transform its scaleY property from to .

After the pop in effect is done, then we animate the popped emoji (inside the effect) to the left with waving effect. We can achieve this by using requestAnimationFrame by gradually decreasing the translateX value. As for the waving effect, we can simulate it using the method.

I hope you find this exploration inspiring! If you want to play with the code yourself, feel free to check it out on GitHub. Also consider subscribing to get notified!.|||
