osFree is a (Free Open Source software) operating system development project, aiming to replace eventually all OS/2 subsystems with Open source analogues. It aims for /2 Warp 4 (Merlin) as a base compatibility system, which does not mean that we will not support features of newer ( /2 Warp Server for e-business and eComStation) /2 versions. This includes rewriting not only user-level code but the /2 kernel too.

We're collecting existing code for /2 subsystems for years. Also we are developing our own bootloader named FreeLdr and /2 personality for L4 microkernel, i.e. a number of servers, implementing the Control Program ( /2 kernel) Interface functionality in userspace. See osFree design and development concept for more details. Visit the Chat Channel on the EFNET

Several projects with similar goals exist (or existed). Here is the brief comparison of goals and tasks of different projects.

Our project is reusing the code of many opensource projects.|||
