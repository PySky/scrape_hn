Are you interested in machine learning, particularly how languages can be translated?

The Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) team has published outstanding results on language translation using a new convolutional neural network (CNN) approach as opposed to the more commonly used recurrent neural networks (RNN).

The code and models are released as part of the fairseq open source project on GitHub so that other researchers can build their own models for translation and see the results of this technology themselves.

Check out the blog post for all the details on this novel approach to language translation.|||
