Hi, I’m Mark Nottingham. I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups, and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board . I usually write here about the Web, protocol design, HTTP, and caching. Find out more .

The IESG has formally approved the HTTP/2 and HPACK specifications, and they’re on their way to the RFC Editor, where they’ll soon be assigned RFC numbers, go through some editorial processes, and be published.

We should have an official entry about this up soon over at the IETF blog, but I want to recognise a few people specifically:

Thanks to everyone for your efforts, and for being such a professional yet fun, smart but humble group of people; it’s been a rare pleasure.

Stay tuned, the HTTP WG isn’t done yet.|||
