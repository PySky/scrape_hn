Here's a look at some of the UI designs from the various Star Wars films. Blind have shared some screens featured in the latest instalment Episode VII The Force Awakens. There's also a tumblr site dedicated to the UI from the original films and a supercut edit of all the UI from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Let's not forget the prequels, which have a different style altogether.

The UI from The Force Awakens is inspired by the original films so they have a similar aesthetic. The prequels however seem to have taken a different approach, as they have for the overall art direction. From the vehicles to the buildings, the costumes to the sets, George Lucas took a fresh approach to the franchise, which was his criticism of the new film. But I personally love the lo-fi aesthetic of The Force Awakens, both from a story continuity stand point and film aesthetic.

I think it's safe to say The Force Awakens sits very comfortably within the world and art direction of the original three films. The UI design is evidence of this. The screens shared here by Blind feel like they could easily be slotted into the originals.

There's similarities in the linework and colour palettes, and even the typography and numerals are a nod to the original art direction. It also looks as though some of the screens are displayed in CRT monitors just like the originals, which give the screens a really wonderful finish.

The design team have done an excellent job extending this style to new screens and adding new levels of complexity and detail whilst staying true to the world. It feels believable and familiar.|||
