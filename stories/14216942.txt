Powerful Quote from #UR Community Chat:

 -----------------------------------------------------------

 People don't yet realize that UR is not about how much dollars it will cost or not cost tomorrow.

 Its about a currency we will all be using, world wide as one global crypto currency.

 Without any relation to it's value versus dollar, eur or bitcoin....

 If you are missing this important factor, you are missing the whole long term benefit of what we are hardly working on right here.

 For example, lets assume that there is a country named "UR" and our currency is "UR". And in that country we all buy and sell things using "UR" currency.

 All the prices we set is strictly based on "UR". This is our currency in our country. We don't care of dollar, eur or bitcoin, because we dont need it.

 All we need is grow our UR capital, to enjoy in that country from everything we possibly can dream about.

 And this is what we are doing here, just in a much more global way, not a single country, not a single city but a world wide crypto currency, everyone will be able to use.

 And the value of this currency versus other currencies will does not really matter to us. Because everything we will do in UR will be based on UR. Not a dollar, not a bitcoin not a EUR.

 Therefore, instead of focusing on other currencies value versus UR. Focus on growing your UR community and build a strong organically growing fundamentals for your UR team.

 The moment people will realize this...and work all together towards this unified goal. Our currency UR will build up, become strong and help us all enjoy from its great wealth in the long run.|||
