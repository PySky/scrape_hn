Saka Key lets you navigate the web with just your keyboard. It differs from existing vi-inspired chrome extensions on four fronts:

Its state machine architecture is modular, extensible, and SIMPLE. It is designed to be as easy as possible to add complex features with minimal effort and understanding of the codebase. It's not vim. Aesthetics matter and graphical menus takes preference over text configuration. It's friendly to non-developers. It's engineered for configurability. The Settings GUI is generated from simple JSON files to encourage authors to make modes configurable. Any changes to a setting are automatically propogated to all tabs without requiring a page refresh. Saka Key supports settings profiles that are easy to switch between and sensible default settings profiles are supported. Per-domain profiles coming soon. It's built with modern web tooling (as of 2017): ES6+, Webpack, Preact... no Coffeescript to be seen. These tools weren't selected just because they're hip and new. Saka Key would be something entirely different without native asynchronous support, ES6 Modules, and functional UI libraries.

Note: This is a developing project that has bugs and lacks features. If you're looking for a robust experience, try some of the more mature options like Vimium and cVim.

Run the following commands in your terminal to clone and build Saka Key

An extension you can run will be generated in the 'dist' directory.

Save yourself some trouble and read the Developer Guide. It explains the basics of how Saka Key works.
