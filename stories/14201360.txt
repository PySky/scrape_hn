It seems that Chinese manufacturer OnePlus will skip one generation and this year’s flagship will be introduced as OnePlus 5, instead of OnePlus 4, due to one pretty weird reason: Tetraphobia.

When it comes to the phone’s specs, we already have some details, but until today, there weren’t any actual images with the handset. However, things are about to change, since a first leaked image – a render, to be more specific – just made the rounds online, giving us the chance to take a glimpse at the phone’s rear camera setup.

It seems that these renders are pretty accurate, being based on what “people who have seen the phone and have possibly worked on the OnePlus 5″ have described. Still, this doesn’t mean that you should take it for granted, since it might be the subject of changes…

Of course, the most important change is the camera setup, which now consists in two sensors, basically following the latest trend in the industry. Also, there’s no sign of any antenna lines on the upper side of the back. But, at a second look, there is a barely visible antenna line somewhere on the bottom. Oh, and it’s obvious that the phone is rocking a full metal build, which gives it a premium aspect!

Spec-wise, we’re expecting a 5.5” QHD display, with a Snapdragon 835 under the hood, alongside 6GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage, the whole device being powered by a 3000mAh battery. Also, back to the leaked image, there’s no sign of a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, so, most likely, it will be embedded into a physical home button. Or, in order to make things even more interesting, it could also be hidden somewhere under the actual front panel!

Stay tuned, as we will be back with more details about the OnePlus 5 as soon as anything new comes up!|||
