Noip.com Dynamic DNS update client built in Node.js. It makes easy to remote access your connected devices!

The easiest way to get no-ip is with npm:

or having it globally installed and used as a standalone tool:

: The callback accepts two params and that gives you the current IP address your domain is currently pointing to and a boolean value indicating if an update was performed.

: Send an update request. Optionally you can provide a custom IP.

: Start an automatic renewal every 1h by default or provide a custom ms.

: Sets the current host to offline status. Offline settings are an Enhanced / No-IP Plus feature. You should call the method after this flag have been set.

If used standalone, I recommend you to start it with some process manager, like PM2.

That start automatic DNS renewal once an hour. To see supported parameters and usage examples just type:

This module makes use of the node DEBUG module. You can enable it setting the env var to before the app starts:|||
