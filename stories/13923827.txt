I've written a small python library called fwarp to warp functions. The helper functions accept a function and some parameters, and return a new function that is a warped version of the original.

I'll demonstrate below, using the numpy sin function as an example, plotted between $0$ and $2\pi$. The functions will work the same way, though, for any user-defined function.

The simplest manipulations are elongating and compressing functions. The second parameter into these functions is the factor by which the function is to be compressed or elongated.|||
