The two biggest features are the new addons and hostfolder commands:

Another new command is which loosely groups some OpenShift related commands together:

And lastly, we added the command, which allows you to configure your shell to use the oc binary that is downloaded to your host during .

In addition to the new commands, Minishift 1.0.0 includes other new features, such as HTTP(S) proxy support, persistent volume provisioning, and the creation of a minishift CLI profile for easier usage of oc.

To help you adopt all of these new Minishift features, we are planning to create a series of blog posts and video tutorials that showcase the full Minishift workflow. In the meantime, you can review the Minishift documentation.

There is still a lot of work to do and we have many great ideas for new features. Stay tuned and check out the Minishift Roadmap if you want to know where we are heading next. Feel free to join us on #minishift on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or ideas.

Last but not least, if you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please take the time to create an issue in the Minishift GitHub issue tracker. We really do appreciate your feedback.|||
