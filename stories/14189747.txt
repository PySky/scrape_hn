Nintendo has asked me to take stop hosting the game. The project will live on, just not with Zelda characters. Follow the progress on twitter!



After being inspired by Nintendo's 2D prototype of Breath of the Wild, I've decided to try out making my own fan-game! Breath of the NES offers a new adventure in the classic Zelda style, but with smooth animations and a more interactive world!

The demo lets you play around in a mini overworld, testing out the gameplay, and discovering tons of fun items! Please let me know what you think!!|||
