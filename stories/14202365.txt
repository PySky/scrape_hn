Today Windows deleted me for a while. Today I deleted Windows forever.

From 1987 to 2007 I exclusively ran Microsoft operating systems. From 2011 till today I have dual booted between Windows and Linux. Over the last 3 years I only used Windows for Adobe InDesign, Itunes and occasionally Balsamiq.

Today, after a monstrous 60 minute enforced update of Windows 10, my Linux Bootloader was gone. I did all the boring stuff you have to do to restore that. An additional 30 minutes of my life utterly wasted. Or perhaps not. The realization, finally, that I absolutely do NOT need this groaning heap of code, APIs, drivers, commercially driven design decisions and organizational dysfunction.|||
