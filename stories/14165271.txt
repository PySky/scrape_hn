The Progressive Technology Initiative’s mission is to modernize progressive movements with powerful and effective technology.

With so many people interested in investing in progressive technology today, PTI wanted to provide an easy way for their supporters to reach out to their social networks and help collect donations.

Using The Groundwork, PTI created a custom peer-to-peer fundraising experience that allows a supporter to start collecting donations in one short step.|||

Your supporters are fighting for your cause just as much as you are. Empower them with the ability to create their own fundraisers and solicit donations on your organization’s behalf.
