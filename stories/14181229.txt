SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) is built to integrate human processes as much as possible when they cannot be avoided.

In many organizations, testing and deploying new code involved a series of manual steps, some of which cannot be automated. This is where SOPs comes in. By allowing the CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger the creation of a new checklist, you no longer need to manually tell people to proceed after a successful build.

The following diagram shows an example of how SOPs can be integrated to add both QA checks as well as Operations and Marketing.|||
