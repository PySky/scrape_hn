TLDR it’s not, thefuck uses functions instead aliases starting from 3.16.

Initially, thefuck alias wasn’t working with command line arguments, if history changing was disabled they were just passed to corrected command. So it was just like:

If history changing was enabled it was less dramatic, it was executing , but it was putting in history.

Also there was a lot of feature requests, that can’t be implemented without proper command line arguments supports, like #614 and #531.

So, why there was a problem? Let’s examine old zsh alias, for simplicity with disabled history changing:

In a few words it was working like:

So when was called with arguments like it was working like:

So in the last step was called.

As everyone know, bash and zsh don’t allow command line arguments in the middle of alias. So I just replaced aliases with functions.

And there’s another problem – how to distinguish previous command arguments with arguments, and the solution is a dead simple – just use some placeholder, like , between the previous command and arguments.

So now zsh “alias” (with history changing) looks like:

It looks almost the same, but more readable and support nice stuff like:

As a drawback, this feature is shell-specific and currently implemented only for bash and zsh. So users of fish, PowerShell and tcsh at this moment can’t use command line arguments with .|||
