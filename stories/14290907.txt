How bad is your smertphone addiction?

If you’re glued to your screen in the company of friends or swiping into the early hours, the Light Phone could be your saviour.

The Light Phone is a credit-card sized device that’s been designed to reduce your smartphone use – and make you happier in the process.

It’s “a simple second phone” for when you don’t want your all-singing-all-dancing smartphone to dominate your life.

You can load nine contacts, and make and take calls. It can ring, it can vibrate. Oh, and there’s a clock. That’s it.|||

"Leave your smartphone behind and enjoy peace of mind," say the Light Phone team.
