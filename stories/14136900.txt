Every programmer has a variable naming philosophy. This is mine:

A name's length should not exceed its information content. For a local variable, the name conveys as much information as or and is quicker to read. Similarly, and are a better pair of names for index variables than and (or, worse, and ), because they are easier to tell apart when skimming the program. Global names must convey relatively more information, because they appear in a larger variety of contexts. Even so, a short, precise name can say more than a long-winded one: compare and . Make every name tell.|||
