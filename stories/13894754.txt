Rather than purchasing modules, you will be able to purchase stand alone licenses for GameMaker Studio 2 on a per platform basis. For example, if you are only developing for web, you only ever need to purchase a web license.

At launch, a GameMaker Studio 2 desktop license (allowing export to Windows, Linux and Mac) will be available for a one time purchase of $99.99*

A Trial version of GameMaker Studio 2 will be available for free, to allow you to explore all of the new innovations on offer. The Trial version will come with limitations on the number of resources a single project can hold and does not allow exporting final executables.

Yes you can - for a limited time existing Professional users and module holders will get 40% off the equivalent Studio 2 product and Master Collection users will get 50% off each product. Please visit this page for more information.

At launch, the IDE itself will initially run only on Windows, a Mac version will be entering beta in the near future. For a full list of system requirements consult this page.
