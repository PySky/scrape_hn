A scalable collector enables round-the-clock monitoring in production as well as test environments. All you have to do is add a list of target JMX connections to our config file and flag them with custom attributes. You can query the stacktraces of the different environments and applications against the mongoDB Store very quickly and efficiently via a powerful antlr-based query engine and mongo's secondary indexes on the custom attributes.|||
