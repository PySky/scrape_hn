OcherBook is an open-source ebook reader, supporting multiple file formats and output devices. The major goals are:

Perhaps the largest distinguishing implementation detail of OcherBook is that its in-memory format is not DOM, and the rendering backends are not web browsers. Think DVI. Therefore it is not going to render complex books nearly as accurately, but it is far more portable and efficient. This may eventually turn out to be a mistake, but for now it's an advantage that I'm running with.

To get the code:

To get started, look in the doc directory, and/or try something simple like:

To cross-compile, look in for a toolchain file for your device. Each toolchain file should include some notes regarding how to acquire and install the cross-compiling toolchain. Once you have the toolchain downloaded and installed appropriately, configure with it like this:

Many features are configurable. Some feature libraries can be disabled, or enabled to build against the system's libraries, or enabled to download and build from source (perhaps useful when cross-compiling). For details, see or run CMake in interactive mode.

OcherBook itself is GPLv3. See COPYING.
