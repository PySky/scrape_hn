You wonâ€™t see any imperative calls like dispatch or setState . Declarative code makes your app easier to reason about and more predictable, allowing you peace of mind.

OutWatch combines functional and reactive programming to enable you to build performant web applications using pure functions.

In OutWatch components are just functions, no boilerplate necessary. Reactive Programming allows us to create fully self-responsible components that never touch external state.

No more wondering where an action or a change in state came from. Components are fully decoupled and therefore extremely reusable.|||
