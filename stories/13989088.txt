Here are 10 steps toward planning and implementing a finished website:

Trello is a fun, free way to break your planning and development process into small tasks that can be tracked.

Here are some example user stories. These will guide how you think about your app's features and functionality. Note that they all follow a similar structure: as a <person> I can <do something>.

This will help you visualize your user stories so you can better understand how to implement them.

Your activity diagram will show the different paths your users can take through our app.

Your mockups will show what your app should look like. It's much faster to iterate on a mockup than it is to do so on working code.

6) Choose the right technologies for our project

If you don't know which stack to use, a popular one right now is the MEAN stack:

You can have a MEAN stack development environment up and running in the cloud in less than an hour, for free.

In this case, you'll have two collections: your "Users" collection will house your user data, and your "ToDo" collection will house your tasks that need to be done. One user can have zero, one, or many tasks in her to-do list, so you'll have a one-to-many (1:m) relationship between our two collections.

We use a free product called Apiary to document our API.

This is the fun part, and it will take up most of your project's time. If you need help with this, join us and learn to code.
