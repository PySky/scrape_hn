Think about this for a second. We don’t hear our own voices. You don’t even like the sound of your own voice. It is a universal human phenomenon. Listeners hear your voice completely different than the voice you hear in your head.

We have coached senior executives, professional investors, speakers and entrepreneurs for more than a decade. It is rare that we meet a client who truly understands his or her own voice and how to harness it’s real impact. If you want more impact and influence in your pitches and presentations, then work on your voice.|||
