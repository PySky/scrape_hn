What hap­pened was, Lau­ren brought home Bringhurst’s The Ele­ments of Ty­po­graph­ic Style and I was in­stant­ly cap­ti­vat­ed, by the book’s beau­ty and al­so the pow­er of its mes­sage. So I’ve got ty­pog­ra­phy on my mind. Stand by for more on the sub­jec­t, but it struck me im­me­di­ate­ly that I’m liv­ing a ty­pog­ra­phy les­son at work, in the form of the fa­mous Ama­zon six-pager.

It’s not a se­cret; to start with, read Brad Porter’s ex­cel­lent The Beau­ty of Amazon’s 6-Pager (although in typo-geek mod­e, I have to point out that “Six-pager” reads much more nice­ly than “6-Pager”).

Like Brad says, we put in­tense work in­to writ­ing these things, and then oth­ers of us put in­tense work in­to read­ing them. I’m at a place in the struc­ture where I find my­self do­ing both; nei­ther is eas­i­er than the oth­er.

As a guy who’s in­vest­ed years in­to de­scrip­tive markup and struc­tured doc­u­ments and flex­i­ble pre­sen­ta­tion and so on, I ought to be hor­ri­fied by six-pagers, which are fixed-format pag­i­nat­ed word-processor out­put. But in fact they work great. It saves so much time when you can say “That repli­ca­tion se­tup, sec­ond para on page 3, won’t it mur­der write throughput?”

You know what I’m start­ing to see? Peo­ple putting in line num­ber­s. And that’s an even big­ger time-saver, par­tic­u­lar­ly if you want to raise an is­sue about how this on page 1 re­lates to that on page 5.

Oh, and we do some ini­tial re­view­ing elec­tron­i­cal­ly, but when it mat­ter­s, six-pagers are print­ed. Be­cause of course.|||
