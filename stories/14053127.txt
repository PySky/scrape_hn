We’re excited to announce that Crew has been acquired by the amazing Dribbble team!

We’ve come a long way in the last 5 years, from our humble beginnings as a Mailchimp and Wufoo form to splitting out Unsplash into its own company, we’ve loved every minute of the journey.

We’ve always been huge fans of Dribbble and when we started talking to Andrew Wilkinson (who recently acquired Dribbble) and Zack Onisko (Dribbble’s new CEO) about their vision for Dribbble it was hard to contain our excitement.

Without question, Dribbble is the premier platform for designers to share their work. It’s where designers go for inspiration and creative directors and hiring managers go to find their next hire.  Being able to work closer with their team is a huge opportunity for Crew and where we want to take our service in the future.

Our goal has always been to build a platform that changes the lives and trajectory for freelancers and makes hiring great people easier than ever. Today we’re proud to say that that journey continues.

Crew will remain Crew, under the Dribbble umbrella.  We’ll operate today just as we did yesterday but now we’ll just have some more amazing teammates to ping for advice. 

 Today is undeniably exciting for us at Crew, but it’s also meaningful for you, our customers and the freelancers who rely to our platform every day. We couldn’t find a better team than Dribbble to make sure your work and projects are easier than ever to bring to life.|||
