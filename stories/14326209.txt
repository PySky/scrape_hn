This week’s bizarre news cycle has now reached its zenith: the Rosie O’Donnell phase. This afternoon, President Trump dug up a December tweet from the actress and poet, in which she called for FBI Director James Comey to be fired over his “intrusion” into the 2016 election. Trump quote-tweeted O’Donnell — a longtime nemesis he once called a “fat pig,” and said he’d need to be paid at least a trillion dollars to consider making out with — to say, well, finally we agree on something. (If you’ve slept through most of this week, Trump fired Comey on Tuesday.)

It is, to be fair, a pretty good drag — if not exactly a relevant one. But it also raises several important questions, chief among them: Was the president spending his Thursday afternoon scrolling through Rosie O’Donnell’s old tweets? Did he do an advanced search for her handle and tweets containing the name Comey? Was it just luck?

Another theory presents itself: Did he — or, more likely, White House social-media director Dan Scavino — happen to see the news on Reddit’s infamous /r/The_Donald, where O’Donnell’s tweet was posted shortly before the president tweeted?

Or did Trump, or someone on his team, read Twitchy, the Twitter news aggregator founded by right-wing pundit Michelle Malkin?

It wouldn’t be the first time a Trump tweet originated on Reddit — a photo of Chuck Schumer and Vladimir Putin wound its way from the news-sharing site to the First Twitter back in March. POTUS can’t get all his news from cable, after all.|||

He probably didn’t find that old Rosie O’Donnell tweet on his own.
