Every month for the past year, we’ve sent out an email update about our progress at Shoelace to a list of friends, advisors and investors. We routinely get compliments like “these are the best investor updates I get!” or “your updates should be the template for other founders!”. I’d love to think that there’s something particularly special about our updates, but after talking to other founders and learning that many don’t write updates as regularly as we do, I think what makes ours stand out is how consistent we are in sending them.
