The version 5.5.19 of SObjectizer core is released!

We glad to provide an updated SObjectizer-5.5. There was a big pause since the 5.5.18 release, but there were several important reasons for this. Anyway we have done a lot of work and we hope that the result was worth it.

Version 5.5.19 introduces two major features which were considered impossible not so long time ago:

The full list of changes can be found in the corresponding Wiki section.

The v.5.5.19 can be downloaded from the corresponding Files section or can be checked out from Subversion repository and from mirror on GitHub.

The Files section has the following archives:

Note. There is no archive with binaries for MSVS2015 in x86 mode because SourceForge detects some suspicious files in it. But several antivirues like Dr.Web, Kaspersky, Nod32, Avast, AVG, Norton and many more tell that there is no any viruses inside (proof 1, 2). However we decided to remove this archive from distribution and can provide it on demand.

Please note that since v.5.5.10 there are no archives with Doxygen-generated docs and binaries created using MS Visual Studio 2013. Such kind of archives can be created and uploaded by request.|||
