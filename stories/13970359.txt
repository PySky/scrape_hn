All of your private Internet history is now easily searchable! Thanks to the Senate's passage of S.J.Res 34, the House of Representatives also voting to repeal protections, and now the President Trump has given his stamp of approval, your Internet history can now be bought and sold.

I plan on purchasing the Internet histories of all legislators, congressmen, executives, and their families and make them easily searchable at searchinternethistory.com. Anything they have looked at, searched for, or visited on the Internet will now be available for everyone to comb through: their medical concerns and questions, taste in pornography, financial interestsâ€¦

Since our elected representatives failed to let us decide whether our personal browsing history should be a commodity, I wanted to give them a lesson on how a democracy is actually supposed to function: I'm giving you the opportunity to vote on whose history gets bought first.

Help me raise money to buy the histories of those who took away your right to privacy. Some sold you out to telephone companies and ISPs for just a few thousand dollars. Now your private data will be bought and sold to anyone interested in your browsing habits and identity, so it's great news for marketing companies and law enforcement, but bad news for citizens who value their privacy.

So now we're going to turn the tables on the legislators who sold us out. Let's buy THEIR history and make it available.

If you can't donate money, maybe you can donate your time and skills. I want to get help from any of you on proper, transparent, and most importantly legal aspects of accepting donations for this purpose.

Are you someone who can help? Send me a message!|||

Search the Internet history of anyone!
