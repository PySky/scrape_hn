How does it work?

Simply paste your YouTube link in the field, click "Download". On the next page, click "Recognize". Wait and you'll get the language of the video.

Background noise or music adversely affects accuracy, but on the videos, which have clean speech and less noisy audio background, accuracy should be > 90%.

The application is not intended for songs language identification. The result will be unpredictable.
