It’s a big commitment to choose to attend one of the many conferences available in your field.

Besides the cost of entry, you have to book transportation, a hotel room, and figure out how to manage your business on limited time.

It’s hard to know if it will be worth all the time, energy, and money.

Sidenote: Once you finish, read how 4 freelancers built recurring revenue models that changed their business. You'll love it.

This is the exact target market I serve, so I was a little nervous to attend a conference chock full of my competition.

Maybe the conference wouldn’t be so bad, right?

As soon as I got to the registration table and started recognizing some familiar faces from the conference sponsor network, my nerves disappeared. I exchanged IRL hugs with people I’d only connected with virtually and the energy and excitement in the room was something a forum couldn’t capture.

To make sure you get the most out of any conference, here are some of my biggest takeaways fresh from the last conference:

You’re going to be in a room full of professionals selling exactly the same service / product you are.

Join 35,000+ people just like you who get our free newsletter.

It may seem counterintuitive to spend money and time going to a conference where you won’t be prospecting for clients, but instead meeting other versions of you. The reality is, meeting other professionals in your field and sharing best practices will make you better at what you do.

You and your peers who take the time to go to conferences are like-minded people seeking to grow and improve.

You will have the chance to meet people in different stages of their business, which can give you insight into where you want to take yours.

Take full advantage of being in the room with them and also be open to sharing what has and hasn’t worked for you.

One of my biggest takeaways from my conference was even though we were all serving Gen X and Gen Y clients, we are all working with very different clients within a large market.

I was able to get more details about the pros and cons of working with other client demographics.

And you know what?

To be honest, I didn’t want to work with most of the types of clients my peers were working with, and vice versa!

Going to this conference further solidified my true niche – having a super-friendly and approachable way to helping new business owners with their finances and helping clients transition from a full time job to freelancing.

By actually meeting other professionals in what I thought was my niche, I was able to confidently niche down my target market even further. Also, as a bonus, I now had a network of people I trusted who I could refer clients to that weren’t a good fit for me. 😉

This might sound like a no brainer, but I didn’t used to be this person.

Especially for great speakers, usually there’s a small crowd of attendees that pool around them at the end of a session and I was always intimidated to stand behind them, wondering what I would say when I shook the speaker’s hand.

I used to make sure I picked up their contact information and told myself I would just email them later.

Eventually, I got over myself and now make it a point to say hello to speakers I loved. Mostly, it’s just a nice handshake and a quick comment (and maybe a selfie), but sometimes, it becomes something more.

Case in point: I host a weekly radio show and I was able to connect with awesome people who I knew would be great guests on my show because I just saw them speak! You never know what could come out of introducing yourself to someone who you think highly of.

Speaking of speakers, I had the opportunity to speak on a panel during the conference.

Besides being a total blast, I was able to connect with people who really connected with me during the session because they came up to me afterwards!

Sometimes, it can be overwhelming to know who to spend time with when there are hundreds, or even thousands, of people to choose from.

I’ve found that the best way to “find your people” at a conference is to take the opportunity to speak and you’ll find out who you resonate with immediately.

Speaking will also help you establish yourself as an authority on a specific topic in your profession or industry.

If you feel like you have some useful knowledge, processes, or experience to share with your peers, do everyone a favor and find a way to speak at your next conference.

ADDED PERK: Sometimes your conference ticket will also get comp’d if you volunteer to speak!

The best conferences will have events and activities, outside of the conference space, after the sessions have finished for the day.

There’s such little time during a conference as you’re rushing between sessions and trying to check out the exhibitor hall that it’s almost impossible to have a real conversation with someone.

Hand everyone a drink ticket and put out some food at a bar and suddenly, people are pulling out pictures of their kids and dogs and telling you their life story.

Post-conference events are the quickest way I’ve found to connect with people who you’ve been wanting to talk to during the whole conference.

Also, at the conference I went to, many of the speakers also went to the post-conference events so it was a great way to catch them in a more relaxed setting.

You will never have time to sit down with people one-on-one and dig into too much, but you will be able to touch base with others, make sure you get their contact information, and remind yourselves that you’re all people.

This conference has been the conference that has kept on giving, and it’s mainly because, during the conference, I made specific plans with people for how to keep in touch.

The most fruitful way I’ve found to do this is to create or agree to join mastermind groups or study groups. (like the Millo Mastermind group)

You don’t have to literally set up the group during the conference, but a firm yes and someone volunteering to take the reigns to start it (usually the person who’s corralling a group already has plans) means you’ll come home to a full inbox.

I left the conference agreeing to be a part of three groups. So far, it’s been an awesome way to keep me accountable and stay in touch with people in my profession who I admire and relate to.

Will I be able to realistically keep up with all three groups? That sounds like another blog post for another time 🙂

Would love to hear your strategies and tips to get the most out of your conference experiences!|||
