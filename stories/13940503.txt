The First Levitating Turntable is designed for people who appreciate high quality sound and innovative design. It comes with a pre-fitted tonearm and cartridge. This setup allows you to connect through phono in. Once youâ€™re done, you just have to pick your favorite record, turn the turntable on, move the tonearm into position and lower the cueing lever. Then sit back, relax and enjoy.|||
