Setup your own personal VPN server hosted on Digital Ocean with a single command.

Execute and then follow instructions on the screen (normally it's enough to press ENTER on every question):

Read below how to get API_KEY_HERE and SSH_FINGERPRINT_HERE. First is needed to create/destroy droplets by your account, another is to be able to access created droplet using SSH.

Once script is finished, it will download client.ovpn file you can inport into your networking applet.

Each command supports additional argument called optional_tagname which is by default "private-vpn". Tagname is used to identify droplets if you have more of them.

Create command also supports optional_region which is by default "nyc3". See supported digital ocean regions. At the time of this writing it is AMS1, AMS2, AMS3, BLR1, FRA1, LON1, NYC1, NYC2, NYC3, SFO1, SFO2, SGP1, TOR1.

After droplet creation openvpn-script-run.sh script is uploaded and executed on the server. If you want to modify vpn behavior just add anything to this file.
