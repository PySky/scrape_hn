What is Machine Learning?

Traditional programming requires human to define set of instructions

which requires a tons of code and leave a plenty of room for error.

With machine learning, we just need data, a tons of data to be precise. 

Lucky for us, thanks to internet and smartphones, we have a tons of data.

In machine learning, instead of following hard coded instructions, a program can learn from data or adapt its behavior according to experience.



We can divide Machine Learning into three broad categories.

Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.
