Pick two people (that you already know) that you want in the group – invite them Hey, I’m organizing a peer group focusing on topic – are you interested in participating in a small group discussion with other local folks?

Ask those people to recommend two people they want to be a part of the group – invite them, too

You should have 6-7 people now – if not, keep asking people that are interested to recommend people to invite

Send out three dates for a half-day meeting with Doodle – pick the soonest date that everyone can make

Email everyone (in one email thread) with the date and meeting agenda – this is now your discussion forum

You will host the first meeting so book the space and handle food Day of the first meeting

You will volunteer to be the moderator of the first meeting

Start on time and have everyone introduce themselves – name, company, role, what they want to get out of the group

Set the rules of engagement – use Chatham House Rule unless there is a strong reason not to

Explain the discussion format – use Lean Coffee unless there is a strong reason not to

Have a productive, educational, energizing, and cathartic discussion with your new peer group

Get a volunteer to host next time (quarterly works well)

Email everyone thanking them for their participation and enjoy the rest of your day|||
