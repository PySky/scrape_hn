PlantSnap is a mobile app that helps you identify plants, flowers and trees. Simply snap a photo of the plant, and PlantSnap tells you what it is!

We are currently in beta and plan to launch this spring. Sign up to receive email updates on our progress, for the chance to win a premium version of our app, and to be the first to know about future contests and opportunities!|||
