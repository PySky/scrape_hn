Tesla released its delivery numbers for the first quarter 2017 and achieved both record deliveries and production during the first 3 months of the year: approx 13,450 were Model S and approx 11,550 were Model X. The company is on track to achieve the higher-end of its delivery goal of 47,000 to 50,000 vehicles for the first half of the year.

Furthermore, Tesla confirmed that 4,650 vehicles were in transit to customers during the end of the quarter and therefore, the company will only need to produce and deliver about 20,000 during the next three months in order to reach its goal.

The Model S is still Tesla’s best-seller, but it was probably the only full quarter when the Model X was available in all of the company’s markets.

If Tesla sticks to its production schedule for the Model 3, the current quarter should also be the last quarter that Tesla only offers 2 models.

PALO ALTO, CA — (Marketwired) — 04/02/17 — Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in Q1, of which approx 13,450 were Model S and approx 11,550 were Model X. This was a new quarterly record for us and represents a 69% increase over Q1 2016. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5%. In addition to Q1 deliveries, about 4,650 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These will be counted as deliveries in Q2 2017. Q1 production totaled 25,418 vehicles. This was also a new quarterly record for us. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.|||
