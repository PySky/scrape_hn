I just discovered that my HP 635 transmits audio from the built-in front panel mic AM modulated on both 38.031/38.173 MHz (mic activated) or 37.837/37.940 MHz (mic deactivated). Pics you see are made with silence in the room, when i make noise or speak the AM modulation can be seen and heard from the AM HDSDR demodulation.

Two years ago /u/cronek described the same for a HP laptop on around 24 MHz. My signals seen here are even more clear and stable.

edit - laptop with mic is the same where the RTLSDR is connected.

Checked radio transmission from the laptop with an OTG cable, my stick, an android phone and "RF analyzer". Nothing to see there, not a little bit. Cross checked this setup with FM radio stations, that works. So the signal is weak and only measurable when RTLSDR is connected to same computer (signal over cable). This should differ with a better antenna.|||
