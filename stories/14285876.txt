"Java8 support" in Android is sometimes misunderstood because it includes a few independent issues.

Java8 Language Feature is usually syntactic one, for example lambda expressions or default methods; in Android, this is solved by tools like or .

Java8 API, or Standard Library, is runtime library on the platform. The support of Standard Library in Android is more difficult than Language Feature, because dex, Dalvik executable file format, does not allow bundle Standard Library in APK. In fact, it was considered impossible -- before this project shows its possibility.

Retropiler deals with the latter: it makes dex to bundle Java8 standard library by replacing its references to the original ones.

For example, the following code works on devices with Android API level 15 after processing by retropiler:

Here is the magic.

The basic idea is that replacing Java8-specifc classes / methods to the bundled version of them with bytecode weaving.

That is, the above code is transformed into:

It can work even on Android API 15.

Not all the functions are tested yet.

You can customize mapping of stndard class to alternative runtime class:

Retropiler depends on Retrolambda to transform lambda expressions to anonymous classes.
