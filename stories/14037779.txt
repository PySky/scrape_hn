Startups are moving so fast and breaking things so quickly. There is limited time to learn and none at all to waste reading irrelevant content or clickbait. There is also huge information overload, and no product has been able to offer the same quality recommendation Netflix and Amazon are giving but for high-quality and relevant content.

These problems are what keep us at Knowledge Officer awake late in the dark nights, what encourage us to move forward, and what we believe can change lives!

We believe this is the right time for a content recommendation platform for startups and scaleups to exist. A platform that’s fun to use, engaging and collaborative. A platform that serves and empowers these companies. A platform that keeps them knowledgeable and ahead of the curve by connecting them together in a network featuring and generating the best content. We believe there will be a day when startups will be using KO for knowledge discovery as much as they use Trello for project collaboration or Slack for messaging and communication!

We launched our MVP 3 months ago to confirm whether people are interested in quality content and whether they are keen on staying knowledgeable as much as they are on staying informed. We are now working on our official release for companies with some early signing and paying customers.

Help us by spreading the word about Knowledge Officer, a gamified learning platform for people working in startups and scaleups.

And if you want to support us, please give it your love on product hunt and follow our updates on facebook & twitter.|||

Why can’t we “enjoy” learning and not deal with it as a burden or a boring process?
