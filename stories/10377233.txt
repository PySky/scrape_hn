An example universal JS application written with the 3REE stack, React + Redux + RethinkDB + Express. A stack for building apps, front and back end, with just Javascript.

This project was initially conceived to experiment with using these technologies in conjunction with one-another. I have written a blog that relates to this codebase.

This project is useful for:

There is a demo app hosted at 3ree-demo.workshape.io. Check it out. If it is down, please email tanc@workshape.io

You will need to install RethinkDB. You can find instruction on how to do so here. Make sure you have the latest version installed.

Go to http://localhost:3001 in two separate tabs - see changes propagate in real time (Hot Module Replacement works too).

You will need to roll out your own deployment script for a server, but before you can ship you will need to:
