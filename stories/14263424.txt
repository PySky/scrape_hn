Javascript, huh? What an interesting language. While so many have seen Gary Bernhardt's amazing talk "Wat", it is a good laugh to dive into a random part of JavaScript and see how it behaves. I found it very odd how a single-element array is automatically unwrapped for arithmetic operations. But I never knew the that array addition just does string concatenation. Isn't it odd that arrays are NaN if they are long, but not if they are short?
