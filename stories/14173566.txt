Psychology Professor Dr. Jordan B. Peterson explains why IQ is a good predictor of success in the job market. The more complex the occupation, the higher the requirement of cognitive abilities. By ignoring this reality we do a big disservice to those who don't have the requirements even for simple jobs and get left behind. Both the conservative response 'They should work harder!' or the liberal view 'Everyone has the same potential!' are wrong and are ignoring the hard facts of intelligence.
