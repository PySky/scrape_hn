The network has been trained on 80% of the celebA dataset and the faces used for completion have been randomly sampled from the remaining 20%.

This repository aims to implement Raymond Yeh and Chen Chen et al.'s paper Semantic Image Inpainting with Perceptual and Contextual Losses. It is done with the Torch framework and is based on Soumith's DCGAN implementation https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch.

If you want, install the package ( ) and run

to launch a server on the port you chose. You can access it in your browser with the url http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER.

To train your network or for completion add the variable to the list of options.

In your command line instructions you can specify several parameters (for example the display port number), here are some of them:

It is highly recommended to do the computations on the GPU since it will be much faster. However I provided networks that can be used without gpu in the folder (the ones with "float" in their name).|||
