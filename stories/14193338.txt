A cmake module to get dependencies. This module can be used in config mode or in script mode.

The module is just one file 'CMakeGet.cmake' which can be copied into your project and then included. It can also be installed with cmake:

And then it can be used with .

In config mode, this is similiar to cmake's with some differences:

To setup with cmake, first list the dependecies in a requirements.txt file and the add something like this to cmake:

Also, if recipes are used, its best not to list them in the requirements.txt file. Instead just install them in the cmake itself:

Of course, this still has the same weakness as as the toolchain is not transitive.

Script mode enables the ability to write a cmake script to install a dependency. This can help with toolchain transitivity as the user can invoke the script with all the same cmake settings. The disadvantage is that the user has an extra step to install dependencies. For example, a script 'dependencies.cmake' like this could be made to install dependencies from a 'requirements.txt':

So then the user would run this instead:

This will install a cmake package. It will run something equivalent to this in order to install the package:

This will install a list of packages stored in a file.|||
