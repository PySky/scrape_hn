The Macintosh product line has been around for over 30 years, and nearly 200 models have been released; however, there’s one that stands out in particular and holds a special place in my heart—the PowerMac G4 Cube.

Editor’s Note: Giveaway entry form is at the bottom of the article.

It was an absurdly expensive machine that overheated, scratched more easily than a Jet Black iPhone 7 (Apple still hasn’t learned), and had near-daily kernel panics. But do you know what? It was pretty, and it was very quiet. It had no fans, which meant it made no noise other than the purr from the hard drive.

Being disappointed with Apple’s current Mac lineup, I decided to build an homage to the G4 Cube. I call this build “Sherlock.” It runs macOS Sierra, has no fans, no hard drive, and makes zero noise. Not even a little. It’s dead silent. It’s faster than most of Apple’s lineup for a fraction of the price, oh, and I’m giving it away.
