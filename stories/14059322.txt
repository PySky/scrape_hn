HTTPS filtering is a must for any network admin these days and if you implement HTTPS filtering using SSL Bumped Squid you have surely seen the X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY error.

The main reason for this error is very simple – one (or some) certificates presented by the remote HTTPS site are not present in the certificate store of Squid proxy server. Because of that Squid cannot generate mimicked SSL certificate required to perform HTTPS filtering.

Let’s take https://www.apexclearing.com for example. If you access it directly (FF or Chrome or even IE) you will not see any errors. If you do the same through HTTPS filtering Squid proxy the following error page will be appear in the browser.

If you take a closer look at the error page then it becomes clear that the following certificate authority is missing:

It is missing because the administrator of the site apexclearing.com has configured his web server incorrectly - according to current web standards the server MUST present all chain of certificates up to (but not including) the root certificate. In this case only the site certificate is presented by the web server and other certificates in the chain are left away.

To prove that we can go to online SSL Server Site Check Tool at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html. Type the www.apexclearing.com into the search field and click Submit. The tool will respond with results showing “Incomplete Chain” error as inidicated on the following screenshot.

Scroll the result page down and see what intermediate certificate is missing from the chain.

Let’s add this certificate into our OS certificate storage. To do this go to GoDaddy certificate repository and download the gdig2.crt (pem). The URL of the gdig2.crt is visible from Issuer field of the leaf certificate as indicated on the following screenshot.|||
