Doxyrest is a compiler from Doxygen XML to reStructuredText -- hence, the name. It parses XML databases generated by Doxygen, feeds those to the Lua-based string template engine and produces reStructuredText suitable for being passed further on to the Python documentation generator Sphinx.

This elaborate pipeline allows building beautiful documentation for C/C++ APIs with little-to-no changes in the existing in-source Doxygen documentation.

Check out the results of Doxyrest' handiwork in application to a few open-source projects:

The best part about Doxyrest approach is: it's modular and 100% customizable! You can play with Sphinx themes to change visual appearance (fonts, colors, page layout, etc). Or you can adjust Lua frames for more drastic effects -- from tweaking the declaration coding style to changing the whole structure of documentation!

You can even replace Doxygen with your own generator of Doxygen-style XML database and then apply the very same approach to documenting APIs in any other languages:

Here is a list of steps required to apply Doxyrest to existing Doxygen-based projects:

It is also recommended to turn off XML program listing as it vastly increses the size of XML databases. To do so, add: Prepare Sphinx configuration file -- either take an existing one and fine tune it to your liking, or generate a new one with . Now add Doxyrest extensions and : Usually, Doxygen-based documentation has a main page (created with the directive). If that's the case, add this to avoid build warnings (this page will be force-included): Run Doxygen to generate an XML database. The exact way of doing so depends on the project; it may look like: Run Doxyrest to build reStructuredText documentation from the XML database obtained on the previous step: If your project has a main page, add the following to the command line: to force-include the contents of the main page into .

Now open and enjoy the new awesome look of your documentation!

Of course, you can also follow the build logs on Travis CI -- always a great way to reproduce build steps.
