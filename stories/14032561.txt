We finally got a decent recording of one of my favorite talks. This one is about our Incremental library (which I wrote about here), and in particular about the story of how we got to the present, quite performant, implementation.

It's not clear from the talk, but the work on this library wasn't done by me: The initial version was implemented by Stephen Weeks and Milan Stanojevic, and most of the intermediate versions were implemented by Nick Chapman and Valentin Gatien-Baron.

The high quality org-mode slides, though, are all me.|||
