Thanks to Parameter hints in PhpStorm, code becomes more readable and easier to understand. Parameter hints are now showed for literals and nulls used as method arguments, helping you better understand the semantics of specific methods. We've also added an option to customize your inline parameter hints to fit your IDE color scheme.

2017.1.1 New option is added to always show parameter name hints independent on the statement that expresses the parameter value.|||
