Welcome to F.I.S.H., a mashup of several data sources that I've combined to help me explore my adopted state of Washington.

I'm using data provided by the United States Geological Survey, TrailAPI.com, The Beer Mapping Project, ReserveAmerica, Mapbox and OpenStreetMap to build an application to map a few of my favorite things: fishing, camping, hiking, mountain biking, and beer.

I've mapped the location of stream flow meters maintained by USGS to help identify stream access points. I'm assuming that stream flow meters are somewhat accessible to the general public.

Please check with local authorities to insure access to the stream is legal and safe at or near the stream flow meter.

After locating a place to fish, you'll probably need a place to setup camp. ReserveAmerica data is used to map the nearest campsite locations.

When the fishing is flat, go for hike. I've mapped nearby hiking and mountain biking opportunites using data from TrailAPI.com

Finally, every good adventure should be finished off with a cold brew in the company of friends. The Beer Mapping Project has a great database of brew pubs and breweries.

All the good .com domain names are taken. I've resorted to using the NATO phonetic alphabet to source a somewhat meaninful name.

If you follow any of the Reserve America links and book a campground I get a bit a cash.|||
