Whether or not “the pipeline problem” is one of the major contributors to the overall lack of diversity in tech, there are many things you can do to ensure it’s not a problem in your own organization. To help you address this problem, this post lays out a list of resources (compiled by Ablorde Ashigbi) for improving the diversity of your talent pipeline and hiring process.

Before we begin, there many others with deeper expertise in this area than ourselves — Code 2040, Paradigm and Project Include are good examples of organizations that live and breathe the work of building more inclusive tech ecosystems. But we hope this provides a living document that companies (particularly in Chicago) can use as a resource when looking to add a more diverse set of talent to their teams.

Many of these organizations have formal engagement mechanisms for companies looking to diversify their workforce. Even the ones that don’t will be happy to speak with you and provide advice and referrals to help you in your diversification efforts.

Have any great resources to add to the list? Feel free to reach out on Twitter or just leave a comment here. Thanks!|||
