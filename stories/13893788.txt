Update 28 Sep 2016: Thanks to Graham Tyler Wong 👏, I have brought back all the links here. More to come soon.

Recently, I've been doing a lot of training, consulting and teaching people how to get better at product design. I still believe nothing beats craft and spending enough hours on projects (even side projects) and getting enough feedback from other designers, users and clients to actually get good, but I think this is a good list to expand your knowledge.

Since some of these things here are classics (like Bringhurst's “Elements of Typographic Style”), some will be expanded and some are in the constant state of flux (like prototyping tools and front-end stuff), the plan is to expand and maintain this list as I go. Check the last updated date below to know if you're getting the fresh version.|||
