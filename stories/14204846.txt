We present an update of my previous article for cryptocurrency investment tracking. I received valuable feedback from some users, and I decided to update the spreadsheet based on those suggestions.

The idea with this new spreadsheet, is to add only the transactions in the History tab:

And reflect current asset position in the ‘Position’ tab:

Also, ‘Prices’ tab contains the cryptocurrencies prices:

This new structure keeps tack of all your transactions, and also allows to calculate the profits of those movements.

You can see, copy and comment the Cryptocurrencies Positions Spreadsheet. To create your own version go to ‘File’ -> ‘Make a copy’.|||

Here I present a Google Spreadsheet for cryptocurrency investment tracking. It updates the prices automatically and keeps track of you transaction history.
