There’s a great scene in Forrest Gump. It happens when he talks about a little investment he made with his pal Lieutenant Dan. What company did they buy at the time? Apple. Here’s a screenshot in case you forgot:

The Bubba-Gump Shrimp business was booming. Lieutenant Dan took some profits and invested it in Apple. Or as Gump says “some kind of fruit company.” The movie never tells you how much money they invested or what year it was invested in, but Apple did not IPO until December 12, 1980. So it’s actually possible Lt. Dan made a savvy angel investment in the late 1970s, which was when this scene could have taken place.

But it’s also possible Lieutenant Dan bought Apple right at its IPO.

Apple is currently the most valuable company on Earth. Its market cap crossed $800 billion for the first time ever. Some people are even starting the $1 trillion countdown.

But how much did Gump and Dan earn on their Apple investment? Let’s just pretend they poured $25,000 into the IPO. And let’s also pretend they are still holding to this day.

On its IPO-day, split-adjusted, Apple traded for around 45 cents per share. With $25,000, that would get them about 55,555 shares of Apple (remember that’s a split-adjusted number). As of this writing, those 55,555 shares are now worth a little more than $9 million. A cool 35,000% gain for Dan and Gump. And we’re not even counting dividends. Well done, gentlemen.|||
