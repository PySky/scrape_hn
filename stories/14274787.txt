I just got so tired of being limited to printf("\a"); when I wanted a terminal beep. This program isn't supposed to be anything stupendous, it's just supposed to get the job done. Its intended purpose in life is to live inside shell/perl scripts, and allow a little more granularity than you get with the default terminal bell. Maybe I'm the only one who thinks this is useful. :)

There is a github repository of this code at: git://github.com/johnath/beep.git, or you could browse the source, such as it is, on the web.

I hope you find it useful. I never, never expected, when I wrote it nearly a decade ago, that it would become as popular as it has, or have the enduring appeal that it seems to. Thanks for your patches, your song-playing shell scripts, and your notes just to say thanks. Sorry it took so long to get another release out there.|||
