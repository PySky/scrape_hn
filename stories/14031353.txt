This repository contains a math namespace for Dyalog APL with functions for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, matrix inversion and division, and discrete Fourier transforms.

These functions are implemented as calls into shared libraries. Source code and build scripts for the libraries are included.

Download and extract the files somewhere on your computer. In order for Windows to find the DLLs you'll have to put them:

The only supported build configuration is cross-compiling from Linux to Windows.

This will generate the release package in the current directory.|||
