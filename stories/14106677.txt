In its third edition, the Research and Applied AI Summit (RAAIS) 2017 explores the frontiers of AI from the research lab and the technology industry.

RAAIS 2017 brings together applied academic researchers, students, technology entrepreneurs, engineers and product developers, as well as corporate leadership.

Founded in 2015 by Nathan Benaich, this community-focused showcase exists to accelerate the future of AI technology. We seek to inspire new generations of AI entrepreneurs and researchers to solve the world's most important problems.

To that end,Â RAAIS 2017 donates 100% of ticket sale proceeds to Code Club, a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11.|||
