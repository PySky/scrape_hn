At the height of its military might, the Roman empire was nothing if not prepared for battle, structuring its armies with mathematical precision that might astound even the most assiduous modern bureaucrat. Originally produced for an exhibition at the Vindolanda Museum in the north of England, this short video stylishly explores the structure of ancient Roman armies, including how non-citizens could secure full citizenship for themselves and their lineage through 25 years of honourable military service (if they made it that long, of course).|||
