Here are my picks:

If you’re running a large portfolio and require several integrations e.g. with Jira, then AHA could be a good choice. But, be warned, it’s more time consuming to set-up

Super easy to configure, very visually appealing and great customer service, plus plugins with Slack, Jira etc.

Trello is by far my favourite tool for roadmapping, though I do appreciate it can be difficult when you get to very granular level of details or it’s a large complex organisation (you might need several different trello boards) but since it has been acquired by Atlassian recently I’d expect things to change a little. There’s also a huge bunch of plugins you can use also

For product roadmap visualisation e.g. for wider stakeholders meetings where you’re looking to get buy-in and not necessarily get into the detail, then I’d suggest a presentation format - here’s some further template example|||
