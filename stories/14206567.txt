Do you know where a typical survey solution stores your survey model? Unfortunately, it is rhetorical question. You are likely just do not know. SurveyJS is fully transparent in any aspect, including this one. SurveyJS library uses JSON to load survey model. You may use WYSIWYG SurveyJS Editor to create the survey, and then copy the created JSON into your web page directly to feed it to the SurveyJS library. Of course, you may store and then load SurveyJS JSON model in SurveyJS service or in your own storage. Survey JSON is readable and you may easily modify it by yourself or simple copy it into SurveyJS Editor and do the needed changes at any time. Finally, nothing to stop you from creating or modifying a SurveyJS Model in the code in run-time. At the end, it is just JavaScript objects.

As you may imagine, the SurveyJS result is a JSON as well. You may get the JSON result at any time, for example: on survey complete, on page change or value change. You may set to the SurveyJS a previously entered result or predefined data. Of course, you may get or set the value of an individual question at any moment as well.|||
