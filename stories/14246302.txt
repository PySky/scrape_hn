.NEXT is an industry-leading technology conference where IT professionals gather to get a first look at the latest in enterprise cloud solutions, hear expert advice on building enterprise datacenters, and network with peers on the value that IT can bring to the business.

We caught up with several of our Nutanix Technology Champions and asked them - What are You Looking Forward to at .NEXT 2017 in Washington D.C.? Here is what they shared.

I am looking forward to hearing about all of the latest Nutanix innovations and future features. This will also be my first conference as a partner instead of a customer. So I am excited to be able to attend partner sessions, build new relationships with other Nutanix users, and see what experiences other customers have had so far!

I am looking forward to .Next for a number of reasons. Firstly, it will be my first trip to the US East Cost and I'm hoping to get some time to look around and also stop through New York. For the conference itself, I'm very interested in the nucalm integration and its potential, how Nutanix is balancing the rush for new capabilities and its core mantra of one-click simplicity, and of course meeting a lot of the people I speak to in the community in person.

Nutanix continues to impress at every .NEXT conference and there is a lot of excitment around innovative technology announcements.  Access to speak directly with Nutanix employees is unprecendented, which allows me to discuss business challenges or just geek out with a Nutanix architect.

The main reason is to meet the heroes, the people who are making the change happening in the IT industry. All Nutanix employees are dedicated to their goals, and this is refreshing. Meet the other enthusiast customer, contributors, blog posters and enhanced the community around Nutanix. Great networking time with the partners who are gravitating in the Nutanix ecosystems. Take deep technical dive with experts, discover the future and been listen as a customer who is actively participating into the change.
