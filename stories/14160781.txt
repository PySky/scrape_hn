T-Shirt the kitten was adopted by his dad when he was just 6 weeks old. One of his dad's coworkers had a cat who'd given birth, and she brought the kittens to work with her to see if anyone wanted to adopt them. From the moment Rowan Jones met T-Shirt, he knew he was a special little guy.

"I immediately fell in love with T-Shirt because he was absolutely insane," Jones told The Dodo. "You could see even at that young age that he had a lot of personality. I actually had work drinks on as it was the last day of the working year, so I had to take him to the pub with me. He had no problems mingling with the people at the bar."|||

"I was absolutely blown away when I heard the news and was actually a bit nervous to meet him."
