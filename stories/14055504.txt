We kickstarted the return of our DevOps Exchange SF (DOXSFO) Meetup with a subject close to our hearts and critical for successful DevOps: monitoring. A lineup of expert speakers shared their insight on latest and greatest practices in monitoring, incident management and DevOps teamwork.

Apps generate the traffic, but the network delivers it.  Many DevOps and netops stacks are completely separate, but it doesn't have to be that way! Avi talked about network traffic telemetry—sources, tools, and methods—and showed how that data can be linked to metric, log, and APM systems.

Major incidents can be very stressful, frustrating and chaotic experiences, especially if the on-call responders lack the proper process, training and coordination.

In this talk, Alex walked through a real incident from PagerDuty’s own history, to illustrate what an effective incident response looks like. He recreated the incident timeline step by step and went over all of the different roles involved, including the incident commander, scribe, customer/business liaison and subject matter experts. He also covered the process and tooling needed to respond quickly and effectively to major incidents in order to minimize customer and business impact.

Roy Rapoport discussed the framework Insight Engineering at Netflix uses to think about the real-time operational insight space, the capabilities that any successful organization will eventually need in that space, and what Netflix has done in pursuit of addressing these needs at extremely large scale.
