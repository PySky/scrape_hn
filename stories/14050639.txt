Satori is a cloud-based, live data ecosystem for filtering, and building apps on top of any schema-less real-time live data as it happens - for free. Now cloud-based messaging is a free commodity for everyone, with practically no limits on messages.

Live Messaging, a cloud-based, managed messaging service at the core of the Satori platform. It is known in our technical documentation and client SDKs as RTM.

Live Discovery, a dynamic SQL-based real-time message filtering service that can query at line rate with no configuration or need to index data in advance.

Live Reactions, in-stream bots that attach to live data channels, reacting and triggering reactions at very low latencies.

Apps and bots that use the Satori client SDKs to communicate by publishing messages and subscribing to channels over a WebSocket connection to RTM.

Library of open data channels called the Open Live Data Portal. Each channel includes a description, the actual data being published, an appkey and endpoint, and a console that you can use to run SQL queries on channel data.

The Dev Portal web application is used to create and manage open data channels, projects, and bots for an organization.|||
