BENGALURU: Infosys said it would hire 10,000 American workers over the next two years and create four technology and innovation hubs, as the Indian IT services company looks to mitigate the impact of the tighter work visa rules.

Infosys said the first hub would open in Indiana in August 2017 and would create 2000 jobs by 2021.

“Infosys is committed to hiring 10,000 American technology workers over the next two years to help invent and deliver the digital futures for our clients in the United States,” Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys, said in a statement.

The Bengaluru-headquartered company said it would create training programs for the new hires in areas such user experience, cloud, artificial intelligence, big data and digital offerings, as well as core technology and computer science skills.

Indian IT companies have said they will boost their headcount in the US as they grapple with the possibility of the new and increasingly restrictive changes to the H-1B visa program, on which they are dependent.

Wipro has said 50% of its headcount in the US will be locals by the end of the first quarter of FY18.|||
