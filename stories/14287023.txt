I'd like to get more discussion on-line about approaches to the control problem, so I'm hosting a hangout.

I'll run it lean coffee style meeting with a broad theme of what to do about the control problem. So people propose topics, we vote on the topics to discuss. Then we have a set period of time to discuss the most popular topics, with the topic proposer going first.

Message me with your email address for an invite.

Voting for continuation of a topic will be done via slack, Â so video won't be mandatory. Topic write up will be on a trello board.|||
