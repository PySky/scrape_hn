Vim for Google Chrome. I hate using the mouse, especially after learning Vim. With my desktop (Linux), I have a lot of key bindings that make doing things easier: I open Chrome with , I close a window with , I open a terminal with . This is harder to do with Chrome because it has no section for customizing keyboard shortcuts, and it is still necessary to use the mouse to do things like click links. cVim aims to eliminate this problem as best as the Chrome extensions API will allow it to.

These extensions do a wonderful job of adding Vim-like keybindings to Google Chrome, but they lack many of the features that Firefox Addon, Pentadactyl, have.

nohud nosmoothscroll noautofocus The opposite of autofocus; this setting stops sites from focusing on an input box when they load typelinkhints searchlimit scrollstep barposition Current choices are 'jp' and 'uk'. This allows cVim to use sites like google.co.uk or google.co.jp to search rather than google.com. Support is currently limited. Let me know if you need a different locale for one of the completion/search engines hintcharacters searchengine dogpile If you leave out the '%s' at the end of the URL, your query will be appended to the link. Otherwise, your query will replace the '%s'. This will do the same thing as above, except typing ':tabnew withbase' into to command bar without any search parameters will open 'http://www.dogpile.com' searchengine withbase [ , ] google completionengines [ , , , ] searchalias For example, typing ':tabnew g example' would act the same way as ':tabnew google example' Open all of these in a tab with `gnb` or open one of these with <N>goa where <N> qmark [ , , ] blacklists [ , , ] mapleader reloadTabUncached :restore scrollUp You can use <Space>, which is interpreted as a gb : This unmaps the default 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' mappings This remaps the default 'f' mapping to the current 'F' mapping F : hud : numerichints rootFrame previousTab scrollPageDown scrollPageUp deleteWord Create a variable that can be used/referenced in the command bar eddit_prog op_all op_day TA : eddit_prog/ op_all TD : eddit_prog/ op_day Code blocks (see below for more info) () > {{ ({ur , json: true}, ( ) { Status.

: google This is the same as :tabnew google<CR> : google This is another way of writing the above (these flags can can be added to either the base command or the end of the final command) : google This will open Google in a new inactive tab : google This will open Google in a new window : google The will open Google in a new inactive, pinned tab : google Once again, this will do the same thing as the above command : google : google Here, the & flag will cancel out the ! flag, :bookmarks my_bookmark. :bookmarks my_bookmark. :bookmarks my_bookmark. :bookmarks my_bookmark. :bookmarks my_bookmark.

Nice that you want to spend some time improving this extension. Solving issues is always appreciated. If you're going to add a feature, it would be best to submit an issue. You'll get feedback whether it will likely be merged.|||
