is a detector of uninitialized memory use for the Linux kernel. It is currently in development.

In order to build a kernel with KMSAN you'll need a custom Clang built from a patched tree on LLVM r298239.

You can refer to https://github.com/ramosian-glider/clang-kernel-build for the instructions on running the freshly built kernel in a QEMU VM. Also consider running a KMSAN-instrumented kernel under syzkaller.|||
