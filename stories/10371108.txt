1. It makes no sense to visit Romania.

2. It’s an ugly place with nothing amazing to see.

3. Landscapes are all grey and creepy.

5. Roads with no view at all.

6. And boring valleys.

 13. Outside the city just a wasteland.

14. Maybe you might find a muddy hole.

16. Where is the remote?

17. I should have stayed home and watched a movie!

19. I’ve seen greener plant life in my refrigerator.

20. So, why would anybody bother to come?

21. Just to be disappointed?

22. Just to be bored?

23. Just to be disgusted?

24. Just to see the same bland thing?

25. Definitely, there is no reason to come to Romania!
