Justin Trudeau will honour a campaign promise this week by starting the legalisation of recreational marijuana. Those hoping that every corner store will stock strains so far available only on prescription (Ghost Train Haze and Strawberry Cough are big in Toronto) will be disappointed. The federal government can legalise cannabis, set a minimum age (likely to be 18) for possession, license producers and determine how the product is packaged and advertised. But it is up to the ten provinces and three territories, which already control alcohol sales within their borders, to determine how it is distributed and sold. They seem in no hurry. Talks to harmonise nationwide rules won’t even start until Mr Trudeau’s Liberal government, which has a strong majority, shepherds the bill through parliament. It’s likely to be 2018 before Canadians can legally fire up a joint in public.|||
