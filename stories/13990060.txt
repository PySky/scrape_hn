Buried in the spec sheet for Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus phones is a wonderful bit of information: the new phones will be the first on the market with Bluetooth 5.0. The new wireless protocol should offer some great benefits over the latest standard, Bluetooth 4.2, which was released in December 2014.

The most immediate gains will be in audio, speed, and range. Bluetooth 5.0 offers twice the speed and four times the range as Bluetooth 4.2, meaning you’ll be able to maintain connection up to about 800 feet (240 meters) away from the phone with compatible devices. (Of course, that mileage may vary depending on the environment you’re in.)

The bandwidth of Bluetooth 5.0 is more robust, too, which will allow the Galaxy S8 to do things like push audio to two sets of wireless headphones at the same time. That’s promising for the teens out there who want to listen to a song together, even if it’s still not quite the same as sharing an earbud.|||
