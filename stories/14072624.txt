On the USB drive under the LibraryBox folder, there is a folder named "Config" that is full of text files. This includes:

Some of these are controlled by the menus mentioned above in the FTP setup, but several of them allow you to customize your LibraryBox. You can change the value of:

channel.txt to reflect the wifi channel that you want the LibraryBox to use system_hostname.txt if you'd like a custom hostname when setting up Sync Clients ssid.txt if you want to have a custom wifi ssid to be broadcast txpower.txt if you'd like to make your LibraryBox have just a bit more (or a bit less) oomph when it comes to wifi coverage. The default is 25, but ranges between 20-30 should be safe (although raising the TX power will result in significantly higher power consumption and heat generation by the MR3020. If you make any changes to these files, they will take effect the next time you boot your LibraryBox. I would recommend NOT changing the various FTP settings in this way, stick to the config files mentioned above.

Connect to the LibraryBox SSID with your computer, and SSH into it:



Run the LibraryBox advance setup script:which will give you the following menu:Simply select 4, and hit return. Your LibraryBox is now a DLNA server and should be discoverable by any DLNA client. The setting is saved across reboots, so the next time you power up your LibraryBox, the miniDLNA server will be active.

Setting up your LibraryBox for FTP will allow you to upload, download, and delete files from the "Shared" directory from a computer connected to the wifi signal, without having to physically interact with the LibraryBox or the USB drive. Once you have it setup, you will be able to use any FTP software to login and change the Shared files. Follow the steps below to enable FTP access on your LibraryBox.

A brief word about Mesh/Sync: due to technical limitations and an effort to ensure good user experience in regards to battery life, we've implemented this first Sync protocol to be Master/Client oriented rather that true peer-to-peer mesh. We are going to continue to look at more robust sync services for LibraryBox, but for this release, the Sync works like this:

You will designate one LibraryBox to be the Master box, and any number you wish as the Clients. The Client Boxen will search for a Master every 7 minutes, just looking to see if there is one in range. If a Client sees a Master that has the appropriate login credentials, it will start a comparison and sync with the Master in question. The Client will mirror the Master in content, both in deletions and additions. In order to automagically change the Shared folder on remote LibraryBoxen, you can set up a single Master that stays with you, and you can wander into range of your installed LibraryBoxen, hang out for a few minutes, and move on.

To set up Sync, follow these direction:|||
