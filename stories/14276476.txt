Please join us for our inaugural BoulderFitTech Meetup!

The purpose of BoulderFitTech (https://www.meetup.com/BoulderFitTech/) is to help nurture and build the fitness technology and fitness startup community here in Boulder, Colorado.

Anyone interested in fitness is welcome to join us whether you're a triathlete, a fitness coach, fitness app developer, or an angel investor in fitness startups.

Be sure to stick around towards the end for a free tour of BlackLabSports (http://www.blacklabsports.com) (...and maybe Revo Physiotherapy and Sports Performance (http://www.revoptboulder.com))

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

How to get there: Enter through Pearl Street and Frontier. Walk up the stairs through the door marked Unit D near the docks. We'll meet near the statue of the football player (http://www.folwellstudios.com/portfolio/#/sports/)... you know it when you see it.|||
