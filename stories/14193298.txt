New end links from Rugged Ridge took half an hour to swap on. Getting stuff shipped here is extremely easy, DHL, FedEx, etc. all function perfectly - less than 5 days to get anything from anywhere in the world. ...the new parts are always so clean.... so much easier than washing it. Maybe I'll just give up cleaning it altogether....|||
