Ok, this is how I did it. I have 2ft nipples connected to the flange where the main pole would go. This is in concrete. 2ft deep and 1ft diameter. This was done months ago. The two 10 ft sections are just sitting in the garage. 



I am thinking I may need to completely start over on the tower based on your feedback because if I am going to do this I am going to do it right. If I were to start over what would you all suggest? Keep in mind this is based on a tight budget. I have 100 ft of guy wire, the turnbuckles etc.. so getting a little more guy wire or small items like that won't be a problem but if I have to spend another 200 dollars then I am in the red. It needs to be at least 40ft tall to avoid turbulence from some trees nearby. It seems that the issue here is the main pole... as in getting it 40ft high.



I really do appreciate all of your suggestions/feedback.|||
