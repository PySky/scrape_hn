Having a successful intranet can make a huge difference when it comes to running a business. An intranet that is a useful and time-saving portal that users check in with many times a day can really help boost the efficiency and productivity of your business.

Business needs are most likely the needs and wishes of the stakeholders. These are key players that will inform and direct the project. In most cases, stakeholders are the ones that are most attuned to and invested in solutions and objectives for the company and true for the intranet.

It’s helpful to interact directly with the people using the intranet about the problems they are experiencing and what would help make their UX better. It’s equally important to address user needs as it is business needs when it comes to setting up a successful intranet

The ideal intranet should understand user needs in conjunction with, and separate from, business needs and bring them together in a way that is mutually beneficial

This brings us back full-circle to trying to define the elements of what makes a successful intranet. In addition to the nebulous factors of meeting business needs and meeting user needs, there is also the all-important numbers pertaining to Return on Investment. When it comes to intranet success, the real question is: Is it being used? If you look at it this way, user needs should always trump business needs because if a system’s UX isn’t up to par and users are shying away from it, the ROI starts to plummet.

it’s important to take time and be intentional and understanding of the different needs of the business and users. These two groups have separate agendas, both of which are crucial to the success of the company. Ultimately it’s important to implement a responsive intranet solution that can rise to the challenge of meeting and exceeding both sets of needs.
