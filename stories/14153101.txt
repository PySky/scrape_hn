If you ever wondered who’s the tech enabler behind NY-based digital insurance broker Bungalow, wonder no more. Meet Lockstep Labs, the web and mobile development firm founded by Paul Hiatt back in 2015. So what’s new? Now that Lockstep Labs realized it has what it takes to assist digital insurance players in all things ‘connectivity’ going on APIs, it is announcing the creation of a new internal division specifically focused on product development for insurance and financial services companies. What else? Lockstep has also announced an undisclosed seed round led by Andy Potash, Cofounder of BikeLane Insurance Services and Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Distinguished Programs. Bottom Line: the good folks behind Bungalow – Homesite digital connectivity.|||
