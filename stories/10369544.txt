My name is William Ghelfi, nice to meet you. You should hire me.

I'm an eclectic Web Developer with 15+ years work experience in software development.

 I love creating things. My current tools of the trade are: pen & paper, Balsamiq Mockups, HTML & CSS, AngularJS.

My ideal work routine starts with continuous research, analyzing the UX of everything I stumble upon: from a parking meter to GitHubâ€™s home page.

 After the research comes the paper, and a low-fidelity mockup.

The mockup is then shared, feedback is quickly collected, processed, and merged into the design.

Finally, the best part: building & shipping!

 Give me Sublime Text and a Gruntfile, and let me do my thing.

I know: you want to see a portfolio of sorts. And that's ok; as it happens, I've got one!|||
