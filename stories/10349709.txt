I called up some advance-fee loan scammers who claimed to be from "U.S. Loan Services", a scam company. After trolling them solidly for a while, the jig was up, so I decided to keep calling them non-stop. After another 90 minutes or so, the number stopped working... Enjoy!

About the scam: Many fake loan websites exist that attempt to get the user to provide personal and financial details, including SSN's, over unsecured connections. They will say you've been approved for loans, but need to pay an "insurance" or "verification" fee before you can receive the loan, usually through untraceable wire transfer. This is illegal and anyone who asks you to pay a fee before receiving a loan is a scammer. You will not get any money from these people.
