Geometrize Haxe is a Haxe library for recreating images with geometric primitives. Run the web demo in your browser.

The Geometrize Haxe haxelib is based on the primitive Go library.

Get the Haxe library from GitHub or through haxelib.

Include it in your project

Or add it to your :

Refer to the Geometrize Haxe web demo and code, and this HaxeFlixel example and code. Also read the library documentation.

Basic usage: instantiate an , pass it a and starting background color. Add shapes by repeatedly calling , passing your . Export the results using the methods of and .

A user provides a target image, and the algorithm finds good shapes to approximate that image. To find a good shape, the algorithm generates a large number of random candidate shapes, repeatedly improving the fit of each using a hillclimbing optimization approach, eventually choosing the best fitting shape. Shapes are added one by one.

A detailed explanation of how the algorithm works is given in the primitive readme.

There is no jagginess when saving images as vector-based SVG e.g. pyramid or pomegranate.|||
