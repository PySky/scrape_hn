RISC-V is a free and open instruction set architecture based on modern design techniques and decades of computer architecture research.

With over 60 member companies and a robust software ecosystem, RISC-V is set to be the standard architecture in all modern computing devices, from 32-bit embedded microcontrollers to 64-bit application processors and datacenter accelerators and beyond.

SiFive Coreplex IP are the most widely deployed RISC-V cores in the world and are the lowest risk, easiest path to RISC-V. SiFive Coreplex IP are fully synthesizable and verified soft IP implementations that scale across multiple design nodes, making them ideal for your next SoC design.|||

SiFive is the first fabless semiconductor company to build customized silicon based on the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture.
