typebase.css aims to provide a minimal CSS typography boiler plate. Most css frameworks fail web typography in one of a few ways:

Both force designers & developers to do extra work to realize their design. Let typebase.css handle the vertical rhythm and spacing, you handle the typefaces and design.

The most important thing that typebase.css gives you is an enforced vertical rhythm across most screens (working on mobile). This insures that text across columns and long copy doesn't become uneven.

Like normalize.css typebase.css is built to be edited. You'll find comments throughout the source marking points left for intentional editing. You should substitute your own typefaces in. Don't like how the headings scale? Change it!

This project is meant to be a conversation about good typography. I learn design from other designers. Gimme yo' pull requests.|||
