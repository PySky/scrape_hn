(F8 Conference 2017 Day2) Facebook wants to hack human brain, decode your thought and share it. You could type directly from your brain, and hear from your skin's feeling. 5:33 is a demo in the talk.



From Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook: A few minutes ago at F8, we shared a project we're working on that will one day allow us to choose to share a thought, just like we do with photos and videos.



Our brains produce enough data to stream 4 HD movies every second. The problem is that the best way we have to get information out into the world -- speech -- can only transmit about the same amount of data as a 1980s modem. We're working on a system that will let you type straight from your brain about 5x faster than you can type on your phone today. Eventually, we want to turn it into a wearable technology that can be manufactured at scale. Even a simple yes/no "brain click" would help make things like augmented reality feel much more natural.



Technology is going to have to get a lot more advanced before we can share a pure thought or feeling, but this is a first step.|||
