Starting today, Amazon RDS enables you to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage database access for Amazon RDS for MySQL database instances and Amazon Aurora database clusters. By using IAM, you can manage user access to all AWS resources from a single location, without needing to manage users in the database. This includes expanding and restricting permission levels, associating permissions with different roles, and revoking access. IAM authentication also allows easier and safer integration with your applications running on Amazon EC2.|||
