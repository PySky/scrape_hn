The classic isometric role-playing game Planescape: Torment is being remastered by Beamdog, a company best known remaking other classic games based on BioWare’s Infinity Engine. Called Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition, it will be compatible with Linux, Mac and Windows PCs as well as iOS and Android devices. The game will be available on April 11.

The final product will include a completely remastered soundtrack and 4K resolutions. The Enhanced Edition will also include a number of quality of life improvement to the user interface and the camera, but those features can be turned off for a more authentic experience. The team at Beamdog has gone so far as to partner with lead designer Chris Avellone to “curate gameplay updates, bug fixes and enhancements to best capture his vision for the game.”

The original Planescape: Torment was released in 1999, but the Planescape universe dates back to 1994. It’s based on the cosmology of the Dungeons & Dragons universe and represents a realm where multiple planes of existence come together. The plot of the game centers on “The Nameless One,” a being on a quest to understand why it cannot die.

Planescape’s spiritual successor, Torment: Tides of Numenera, was recently released. Years after its successful Kickstarter campaign, the game — which takes place in another role-playing universe designed by Monte Cook — received critical praise. Polygon’s reviewer called it “relentless.”|||
