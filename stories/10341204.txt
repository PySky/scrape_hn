I alway get asked about hacking WiFi from friends and even family, well one of the ways I know how to do this is by using air crack. Air crack is used to do packet sniffing, on WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 wireless LANs, but grabbing lost packets can take a quite a while so you can get the WIFI password. You can download Aircrack here.

Here is a Description of Aircrack:

Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools. In fact, Aircrack-ng is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks.

Now if you want to crack your WIFI for educational purposes I recommend using Kali Linux 2.0 as it was made for hacking and has a lot of great tools. You can download Kali Linux 2.0 here and I have covered this subject quite a few times which you can read about one of my articles here.

Today I’m going to share a video on how to do this from Penetration Testing with Kali Linux

So if you want to give this a shot, but don’t want to install Kali Linux on your PC or laptop, I recommend using Yumi to make a bootable USB drive the easy way. You can find out more about Yumi here|||
