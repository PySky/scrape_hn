Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg built part of a few Ford F-150s Thursday.

And then, of course, he shared the experience on Facebook.

The 32-year-old billionaire social media mogul said in a post that he stopped by Ford’s River Rouge Complex in Dearborn on Thursday. While there, he “played a very small part in assembling some new Ford F-150s on the line.”

Zuckerberg said he added antennas and bed cleats, set screws and signed an inspection sticker for one of the vehicles. He also said he sat down and spoke with some of the line workers, and wrote of his appreciation for their work.

“Working on the line at an assembly plant is physically hard, and the people I met talked about how tiring it is and how worn down you get,” Zuckerberg wrote. “You have to be perfect, but the biggest challenge is having the focus to do the same thing over and over again.”

Zuckerberg met with Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., toured multiple facilities, worked the assembly line and took a ride in one of Ford's autonomous Fusion Hybrid vehicles, a Ford spokeswoman said.

Zuckerberg was in Michigan as part of a personal "Year of Travel Challenge." He wanted to meet with Ford employees to learn about their work and how they are incorporating new technology and innovation into their business, the automaker said.

Thursday’s trip was Zuckerberg’s first time in Michigan. As of 4:30 p.m., Zuckerberg’s post had over 600 shares and 18,000 likes. The F-150 is Ford’s best-selling vehicle.

“Working at Ford is a long term thing,” Zuckerberg wrote. “Most of the workers I met had been at the plant for at least a decade, and a lot of them have kids and friends who work there, too. Someone told me that when you spend 11 hours a day, four days a week together, you end up becoming family and friends outside of work, too.”|||
