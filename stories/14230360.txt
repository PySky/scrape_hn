Amsterdam is the first Sharing City in Europe and was initiated by shareNL. The purpose of Amsterdam Sharing City is to seize the opportunities that the sharing economy offers in the areas of sustainability, social cohesion and economy. And secondly to formulate answers to the challenges this rapidly growing phenomenon entails.

Amsterdam’s rich heritage and culture, its spirit of commerce, its innovative infrastructure, its live-ability and its creativity set it apart from other major European cities. Moreover, findings from Pieter van de Glind's research on the consumer potential of Collaborative Consumption showed that more than 84% of the ‘Amsterdammers’ are willing to share. All these aspects made (make) the city the ideal platform for the sharing (or: collaborative) economy to flourish on.|||
