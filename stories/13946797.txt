Spotted Places allows you to discover new experiences from friends, both around the world and in your own backyard! By following the people you know or trust you can see their recommended spots on a map near your current location. This makes it easy to see the places you are likely to love because they were posted by people with similar interests to you. 



With our amazing community of travel bloggers and foodies, even if your friends aren't on the app there is something to discover for everyone! 



Spotted Places features include:



•The map hub – The easy to use map lets you visually explore the world and find things to do anywhere, anytime. With its dynamic design, zooming in and out will make the best content appear right at your fingertips. 



•Follow people you trust – Following a user features their spots more prominently on the map, allowing you to see the places your network thinks are truly great and gives you a personalized experience. The spots posted by the people you follow also show up on the newsfeed, helping you to stay up-to-date and discover places as your friends find them. 



•Staying Positive – Spotted Places only shows the best experiences recommended by other users. If you don’t like a place, you don’t post it. This cuts down on unnecessary noise and results in a map filled with only places worth exploring. 



•Amazing content - Spotted Places has been partnering with hundreds of travel bloggers, foodies, and local experts to provide amazing places for you to discover. Don’t forget to add your own, too! 



•Hoot a spot – If you think a spot is a “hoot” you can save it for later. This could either be a new spot you saw on the map, or a place you already love. This then shows up on your “hoots list” which are sorted by your current location, so you always know which spots to check out no matter where you are. 



•Take action – Once you find a spot that you want to experience, Spotted Places allows you to call an Uber, get directions, or even book a hotel with a simple tap of a button. Spend less time planning, and more time enjoying your trip.
