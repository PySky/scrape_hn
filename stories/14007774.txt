How do you build a database like FaunaDB?

Since our serverless cloud launch a few weeks ago, the community has been asking for deep technical insight into how FaunaDB is designed and implemented. A comment by mdasen on Hacker News summed it up:

We are happy to release the first draft of our technical white paper in response. Download it here.

The paper explains the foundations of FaunaDB and the motivations for creating an adaptive operational database.

Databases are some of the most complex systems ever created. A complete database, distributed or not, looks just like an operating system. This is not a new observation, and FaunaDB is no exception. It has:

FaunaDB does not have a windowing system, but we are working on a query explorer and operational dashboard.

Weâ€™ve all suffered so long with existing database technology that anything new seems too good to be true. There has been healthy skepticism (as well as excitement) about FaunaDB so far. We want to begin putting those doubts to rest. We know we have more work ahead of us and are excited for your feedback.|||
