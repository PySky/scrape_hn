The wafers used substrates fabricated at Exagan’s 200-mm epi-manufacturing facility in Grenoble, France.

Exagan was founded in 2014 by CEA-Leti and Soitec to pursue GaN technology.

X-Fab and Exagan have been working on the GaN-on-Silicon project since 2015.

These epi wafers meet the physical and electrical specifications to produce Exagan’s 650-volt G-FET devices.

The wafers were made on X-Fab’s CMOS production lines.

By enabling greater power integration than silicon ICs, GaN devices can improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of electrical converters, which will accelerate their adoption in applications including electrical vehicle charging stations, servers, automobiles and industrial systems.

The industry’s previous work with GaN had been limited to 100-mm and 150-mm wafers due to the challenges of layering GaN films on silicon substrates.

Exagan’s G-Stack technology enables GaN-on-silicon devices to be manufactured more cost effectively on 200-mm substrates by depositing a unique stack of GaN and strain-management layers that relieves the stress between GaN and silicon layers.

The resulting devices have been shown to exhibit high breakdown voltage, low vertical leakage and high-temperature operation.

“It demonstrates the combined strengths of our epi material, X-FAB’s wafer fab process and our device design capabilities,” says Frédéric Dupont, president and CEO of Exagan, “it’s perfect timing to establish GaN technology and products on the most competitive 200-mm platform just as GaN power products are getting broad traction in IT server, consumer electronics and automotive markets.”|||
