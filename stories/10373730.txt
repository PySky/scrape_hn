Hello, welcome to Losing Weight With Pat. I want to help you lose weight.

I will cover as far as reviews go about products that work and products to stay away from. I’ll give you past experience in my own life about things that do work and things I have tried that don’t work.  I mainly want to give fair reviews on safe healthy  products.  So the products I will review will not only be on things that work but things that work in a safe manner. Safety is my first priority.

There are products that work but are unsafe, I want to help you to avoid using such programs. The products I will recommend will be safe for you and the environment.

Also, I will review products and good programs for women, men, teenagers, and kids. Everybody is different and getting a good workout program or diet should be considered on your age and what is safe for you.

Thank you for visiting me at Losing Weight With Pat. If you have any questions or concerns please leave me a comment.|||

I want to help people decide what kind of products are safe and what will work for them.
