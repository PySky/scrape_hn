A lot of programmers start out by cutting and pasting bits of programs together to create their own. In fact, a lot of professional code still gets written this way. Since a program is a list of instructions, you can pick the instructions you like and add them to your own code, a bit like cutting photos you like out of magazines and sticking them together to make a collage. Like with collage, its totally fine to do this, just make sure you have permission to copy the code you’re using, and that you don’t pass off other people’s work as your own. All the code on this page is free for you to copy and use as part of your own work.

For our programming we’ll be using http://processing.org/, which is a programming language made especially for creating art. You can either download it (recommended) or use an online version at http://sketchpad.cc/ if its taking too long to download

Here is a basic skeleton program, with helpful comments to show you where to paste things in:

Once you’ve pasted it in - you can press “Play” to see it run. Come back to this page afterwards for tips on what to do with it.

Here are some lines of code you might like to try pasting|||
