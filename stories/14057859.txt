Whenever I am in a meeting, I put my phone in the Silent Mode so that I don't get disturbed. But a lot of times, I forget to Disable the Silent Mode and I end up missing out on important messages, emails and phone calls. If this has ever happened to you, then keep watching since I am going to show you how to never miss anything because you forgot that your phone was still set to the silent mode. 



There is a free app called Shush, that allows you to smartly control how long your phone will be on the Silent Mode for, after which it will automatically go back to the Normal mode. Once you have installed Shush on your phone, you can activate it by the pressing the Volume down button to 0. You can then set the time at which you want the Silent Mode to be disabled. 

The Shush app, will automatically disable the Silent Mode on your phone and switch it to the normal mode. As simple as that! Never miss anything important on your phone again, just because you forgot that your phone is on silent mode! 

Shush.
