UnixPackage is a UNIX independent way of installing packages. Specify the Ubuntu package name (e.g. libpq-dev), and it will install the equivalent on your system (e.g. postgresql-libs on Arch).

unixpackage is entirely self contained and has no dependencies. It is safe to use sudo pip install with it.

On Arch this will run:

You can also just print the command to install rather than running it:

Or just check to see if it is installed:

There is also a python API for the above commands:

Package names and their equivalents are downloaded from https://github.com/unixpackage/unixpackage.github.io via the generated website:

These files are cached in the ~/.unixpackage directory.

To add more packages you want to be installable in a UNIX-independent way, fork and submit a pull request to this repository: http://github.com/unixpackage/unixpackage.github.io|||
