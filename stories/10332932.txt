Kahlan is a full-featured Unit & BDD test framework a la RSpec/JSpec which uses a syntax and moves testing in PHP one step forward.

Kahlan lets you stub or monkey patch your code directly like in Ruby or JavaScript without any required PECL-extentions.

See the whole documentation here

Note: Kahlan uses the ferver versioning so a version constraint shouldn't ever BC-break.|||
