Hi everyone, we're from the Azure App Service product team and we want you to ask us anything!

We already submitted proof to the Mods, but here's a blog post as additional proof: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-app-service-hosts-ask-me-anything-session/

We're posting this a bit early so folks can ask questions in the evening in case they're working during our AMA tomorrow. Feel free to start asking and we'll start answering tomorrow at 10 AM PST until 4 PM PST.

We'll also have PMs and Devs from the Azure App Plat Engineering team participating in the AMA all day.

Weâ€™ll also have folks from other products available throughout the day as well.

Here are some question ideas:

You can ask us anything about our public products or the team. We mostly can't comment on unreleased products and future plans, though.

If you've never tried App Service, be sure to checkout our Try App Service site which will let you create a free App. We have examples for things like building an ASP.NET site or building a Xamarin Mobile App.

Be sure to follow @Azure to keep up to speed with what we and other teams on Azure are working on. After this AMA, you can also tweet @AzureSupport at anytime if you have any questions. We also watch Stack Overflow and our MSDN Forums for questions and try to be as responsive as possible. If you'd like to see an AMA from another Azure product, send /u/AppService a PM.

Also, the Mobile Team is running a survey right now. If you build any Mobile Apps and would like to share your thoughts with the Azure Mobile Team, fill out this survey and they may reach out to you. http://aka.ms/AzureMobileSurvey

We're kicking things off now. Love all the questions we see. Keep them coming! :)

It's 4 PM here, so we won't be actively on the thread anymore, but feel free to ask more questions by tweeting at the @AzureSupport twitter handle. We also browse this subreddit pretty frequently and look for SO Posts and MSDN. Definitely reach out us if you ever have any issues. We're all about making life easier for developers, so we love answering questions and getting your feedback. :)

These folks will be responding from their own accounts as well:|||
