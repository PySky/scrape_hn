Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) is only a few short weeks away, and with it comes one of the most exciting new features Linux has seen in a very long time…

ZFS is a combination of a volume manager (like LVM) and a filesystem (like ext4, xfs, or btrfs).

ZFS one of the most beloved features of Solaris, universally coveted by every Linux sysadmin with a Solaris background. To our delight, we’re happy to make to OpenZFS available on every Ubuntu system. Ubuntu’s reference guide for ZFS can be found here, and these are a few of the killer features:

These features truly make ZFS the perfect filesystem for containers.

You’ll find zfs.ko automatically built and installed on your Ubuntu systems. No more DKMS-built modules!

You’ll see the module loaded automatically if you use it.

It’s really quite simple! Here’s a few commands to get you up and running with ZFS and LXD in 60 seconds or less.

Now, let’s install lxd and zfsutils-linux, if you haven’t already:

Next, let’s use the interactive lxd init command to setup LXD and ZFS. In the example below, I’m simply using a sparse, loopback file for the ZFS pool. For best results (and what I use on my laptop and production servers), it’s best to use a raw SSD partition or device.

We can check our ZFS pool now:

Finally, let’s import the Ubuntu LXD image, and launch a few containers. Note how fast containers launch, which is enabled by the ZFS cloning and copy-on-write features:

We’ve written a short reference guide to help with getting started, and understanding the ZFS terminology. This touches the basics on setting up ZFS pools as well as creating and using ZFS file systems.

If you are new to ZFS, I recommend having a look at the reference guide to get you started.|||
