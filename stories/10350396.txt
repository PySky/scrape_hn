The RAML Workgroup has announced plans for RAML 1.0 Final Candidate to be published at the end of this month. RAML stands for RESTful API Modeling Language and is one of several API description specifications than can be used to design and document APIs. The announcement was made in a blog post on the RAML.org Web site by Uri Sarid, a founding member of RAML.org and CTO of MuleSoft (MuleSoft is the parent company of ProgrammableWeb).Â RAML 1.0 will include a few significant changes that will dramatically improve modeling capabilities while still maintaining the simplicity of RAML. RAML 1.0 will include improvements to data types, examples, annotations, overlays, libraries, and more.

The RAML Workgroup has been studying the growing list of candidates for the next version of RAML for nearly a year. The group also studied issues brought up in other API description language community groups like Swagger and API Blueprint.

While there was a fairly long list of changes and new features suggested by the RAML community, the workgroup decided to make a few changes that would greatly improve API modeling without adding code bloat or unnecessary complexity to RAML.

RAML 1.0 improvements will include (but not limited to):

The RAML Workgroup plans on finalizing and publishing the RAML 1.0 specification by the end of this month. However, those that prefer RAML 0.8 may continue to use it. RAML 1.0 is a continuation of RAML's primary design principle, simplicity; RAML 1.0 will be simple to write, simple to read, simple to reuse.|||

RAML 1.0 Final Candidate is coming soon and will include significant improvements to data types, examples, annotations, overlays, libraries, and more. RAML stands for RESTful API Modeling Language and is based on YAML, and allow developers to document APIs in a human-readable form.
