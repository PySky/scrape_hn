Introducing the first book released by Bureau Gorbunov Publishing — a practical guide to typography and layout with an emphasis on design for the screen. The interactive handbook is intended for web and user interface designers, software developers, content authors and editors.

Unfortunately, many books about typography and modular grids donʼt answer exactly how to create an expressive page with a solid layout. At best, the designer is left with no choice but to search for scattered clues of meaning and copy some decent examples.

“Typography and layout” consistently answers the how‑to question. The author introduces the rule of internal and external, the principles of modularity and anchor objects. Then, step by step, he visually explains how to create clean and compact layout for websites, online services, applications or media.

The narrative progresses from the small to the big: from elements to modules and entire pages. Then, readers solidify their knowledge by taking interactive tests.

The book practices the same layout principles it preaches, and is designed to be read on the screen. The innovative format and user interface offer techniques for presentation and illustration that would be impossible to implement in a paper book.|||
