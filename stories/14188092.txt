An extensible asynchronous task execution framework, aimed at supporting functional (e2e) testing. Allows for modeling of tasks as statemachines, using a delcaritive yaml syntax. Schedules, executes instructions, applies task state transitions, and reports on task statuses.

Writing reliable functional (e2e) tests is hard. They are notorious for being flaky, time consuming, and difficult to maintain because they require:

func-y task engine aims to separate the task definition, from how it is executed, and how each step of the task is transitioned.

 It should allow for complex multi-step functional (e2e) tests, often involving concurrent operations, to be statically defined as a list of state definitions.

Right now the easiest way to see how func-y task engine works may be to read the tutorial.
