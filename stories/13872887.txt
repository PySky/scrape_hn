We developed the core backend using gRPC and Go. The gRPC service has two methods - one is a unary request/response, and another that takes advantage of server side streaming.

We then use grpc-gateway to expose the unary request/response as RESTful service.

The service definition looks like this:

The RESTful API is also registered and managed by Google Cloud Endpoint, so that we can easily monitor and manage service deployments.

The services are deployed into a Google Container Engine (managed Kubernetes) cluster. The API endpoint, is exposed via a Kubernetes Ingress that’ll automatically create a Global HTTP(s) Load Balancer.

We used kube-logo to automatically provision a SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt for HTTPS.|||
