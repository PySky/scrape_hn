Messenger Platform supports custom sharing from the webview, letting developers provide a custom message and destination for messages shared from their bot.

Several enhancements were added to these features to allow them to work with Chat Extensions. Here's what you should know:

The function has a parameter which now supports mode. This allows the user to share to the thread they invoked the Chat Extension from, rather than having to select another thread. Most developers should choose mode for inside the extension itself.

There may be situations where you wish to check whether this mode is supported by the user's version of Messenger. Use the method and check for the key to be sure.

The callback for is called regardless of whether the user confirms the share or cancels, as long as no error was encountered.

Messenger now passes field in the response to the callback telling you whether a message was actually sent.

After the user has shared, it's a good idea to close the window if you're done, or direct the user to the next part of the flow.
