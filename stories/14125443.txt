When you think of an Apple notebook charger, it always comes to mind the classic white adapter with MagSafe to which you can attach an extension cord, right?

But with the debate we have over the disappearance of the traditional USB, a team of people under the name of Homey has had a very good idea: attach that charger to the concept of USB Hub and port an all-in-one called PowerUp Which replaces the charger that comes with the new generation MacBook and MacBook Pro.

Basically, Homey PowerUp is a power adapter that charges your MacBook or MacBook Pro with 60W of power but also has three traditional USB ports.

There you can load three devices like an iPhone, an iPad, and an Apple Watch at the same time; Promising a charge twice as fast.

In addition, the charger can be used independently without the MacBook or MacBook Pro, being able to use the USB-C port to load any other device that uses this new interface.

You can also take advantage of USB-C also pass data, connecting any disk or external memory to transfer data at 5 Gb per second.

This adapter that can greatly simplify a number of accessories that carry in the backpack the users of one of the new MacBooks was born of a project of crowdfunding, but calm: already have gotten twice the necessary funding.

Now it is only a question of who the responsible ones fulfill the promised one and begin to send the units ordered from June and July. To get one you have to make a minimal contribution to the $ 69 project.|||
