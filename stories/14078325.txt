Apple patents dozens and dozens of ideas for its upcoming products and services. Of all these patents, some become reality after many development and research.

On this occasion, Apple has introduced some 250 new patents, among them is a kind of case power bank to load the AirPods and other devices.

The patent shows us a box in which different products of the company can be charged wirelessly. For example, we can charge from the AirPods to larger products like the iPad or even the MacBook.

The description of the patent supplied by Apple gives more details about it, yes, you have to keep in mind that at the end of the day it is just an idea, so the concepts are rather broad.

The box could charge different devices, such as MP3 players and Apple iPod devices, portable video players, telephones, video cameras, projection systems, tablets or laptops. Some of these devices can be configured to provide audio, video or other data.

Getting a box for AirPods to have enough load capacity to load a MacBook would certainly be a feat.

That is why this box would surely be something bigger than the current one. In any case, it would have to be seen if it ever comes true.|||
