You can now migrate code from an existing TFVC repository to a new Git repository within the same account. To start migration, select Import Repository from the repository selector drop-down.

Individual folders or branches can be imported to the Git repository, or the entire TFVC repository can be imported (minus the branches). Users can also import up to 180 days of history.

We strongly recommend reading our whitepapers â€“ Centralized version control to Git and TFVC to Git before starting the migration. For more details, please see the feature documentation. Give it a try and let me know if you have questions in the comments below. Thanks!|||
