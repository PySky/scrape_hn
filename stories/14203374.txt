I have started to read The New Turing Omnibus - a book that offers 66 concise, brilliantly written articles on the major points of interest in computer science theory, technology and applications.

From time to time, I will write a blog post presenting a chapter of this book.

Today, I am glad to present an interactive version of Chapter 1 about algorithms in general.

In order to explain what is an algorithm, the author presents a simple recipe for generating wallpapers.

Here is the recipe:

Now, we are going to code this algorithm in and you will be able to play with it right in your browser thanks to the interactive Klipse snippets.

First, we need a function that draws a color pixel on a canvas:

Then, a function that erases a canvas i.e. color it in white:

The algorithm is controlled by the geometry of a square:

The cool thing about this algorithm is that when we modify the side of the square, we get a completly different pattern:

Go ahead, play with the code…

The interactive code snippets are powered by the Klipse plugin.

We can generate a 3-color wallpaper by calculating the remainder of modulo 4 and chose a color accordingly:

Again, when we modify the side of the square, we get a completly different pattern:

Someone in reddit suggested to loop over the value of in order to watch all the generated wallpapers like a movie.

Here is the result:

Are you able to provide a simple explanation about this algorithm?

How is it able to generate so many different beautiful patterns?

Have you found a magnificient pattern? Please share its code…|||
