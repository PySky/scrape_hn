This page contains some data obtained through experiment conducted with help of Redit and Hacker News users. It was about checking how much http trafic can handle ESP8266 ( 64KB DRAM , 96KB SRAM , 32-bit RISC CPU running at 80Mhz ), powered by ureq framework. Thank you all for participating! Threads: Reddit , Hacker News .

There were some changes implemented during the test. After first 3k requests it hung up (without crashing, which is bad). After minimizing number of concurent connections, device maintained stability. Then, when the traffic has increased dramatically, I moved css into index.html file so I took only one request to load landing page. Later I blocked requesting /favicon.ico (at least 1/4 of request was for that favicon). Last change was to force reboot every 400 requests so I didn't have to watch it all the time. Since that moment, there were no outages (except my internet modem reseted twice).

Physically. At the front ESP8266, mounted on simple board with switch for selecting boot state, in the background USB-UART converter.
