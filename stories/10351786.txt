Every city is different. London has The Tube. New York has the subway. And New Delhi has The Metro. From today New Delhi also has its own public transport app.

Getting transit directions when your connection is spotty and data is expensive can be tough. So we have made directions and timetable information for New Delhi metros and buses available offline. That way, even if you don’t have a connection, you can still get directions between any bus or metro stops and find how late your bus or train will run.

In addition to having lots of useful information available offline, also provides you with public transport news and delay information when you do have a connection, all packed into a small app of about 1 MB download size.

app is available for Android from the Google Play store. It’s still very early days for this app and we would love to hear your feedback. Let us know how it’s working for you and what we can do to make it more useful by clicking the feedback button at the top of the app|||
