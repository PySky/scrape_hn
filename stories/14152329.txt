Judge rules in favor of “Drone Slayer,” dismisses lawsuit filed by pilot A Tennessee attorney with an expertise in drone and aviation law announced this week that he is running in 2018 for United States Senate. Earlier this month, James Mackler quit his job at Frost Brown Todd, a Midwest and East Coast law firm, to pursue his political campaign full time.

Mackler, who goes by @drone_attorney on Twitter, represented David Boggs, who recently lost a lawsuit he filed against a man named William Merideth. Merideth is a Kentucky man who shot down Boggs' drone when Boggs flew it over Merideth's property in 2015. Other attorneys from Frost Brown will continue to represent Boggs as he evaluates whether to appeal the decision.

Mackler, who is running as a Democrat, will face off next year against incumbent Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, among other challengers. Tennessee hasn’t elected a non-incumbent Democratic senator since Al Gore, who served in the position from 1985 to 1993. Gore resigned the post to become vice president under President Bill Clinton.

Man who claims he invented e-mail is now running for US Senate For now, Mackler’s campaign website does not contain any policy proposals or other related platforms.

The would-be lawmaker also served eight years in the US Army, including three years as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot (one of those years was in Iraq), before he transferred to the Judge Advocate General Corps. Today, he continues to serve as an attorney in the Tennessee Air National Guard.

"I think I stand a good chance to win because our country is divided and our people are fed up with our leaders in Washington," he told Ars. "[Citizens] are much more concerned about finding true servant leaders than they are about finding a political affiliation label. The situation has reached a point where I cannot stand by on the sidelines and watch any longer."|||
