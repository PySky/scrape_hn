Stacker is a simple tool for defining application environments, aka stacks. Each stack is optimized for development and for production use as well. Stacker is built on top of Docker and Docker Compose as an abstraction layer. The main paradigm followed in designing Stacker was convention over configuration.

Is your stack missing? Please open an issue and we'll take care of it. Since we're not experts in all stacks, your input and guidance will be helpful to make a top notch stack. For the moment, we will keep all the stacks inside the official repos just to make sure they all follow best practices.

Here is a list of the stacks we want to add with your help: Symfony, Ruby on Rails, Django, Meteor, Play, Ghost. If you have other stacks in mind just let us know.|||
