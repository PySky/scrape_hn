In our current tier-ed pricing model, unless you have exactly 10, 25, 50 or 100 users, you can end up paying for seats you don't use. For example, if you have 35 developers in your team, you pay $50/month for the 50-user tier and have 15 seats unused. In the new pricing model (price-per-user), you only pay for the users who are actually part of your team.

Some of you will see a price increase. Using the example above, you will pay $70/month under the Standard plan i.e. $20 more under the new pricing model. Additionally, the Standard plan will include 5 GB file storage for LFS and 500 build minutes for Pipelines per team.

Per user pricing so you pay only for what you use. Standard plan will be $2/user/month and Premium plan will be $5/user/month.

A "build minute" is one minute of machine time running a Pipelines build. 1 GB of "file storage" is the available storage space, currently through LFS, for media or other large files. This storage space is in addition to 1 GB of storage per repository.

Yes! Your current free community or academic subscriptions will continue to include unlimited private repositories for unlimited contributors (which will include 5 GB file storage for LFS and 500 build minutes for Pipelines per team) when the new pricing change takes effect. Fees will apply for additional build minutes and file storage.|||
