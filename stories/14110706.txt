Everyone who tries billion-dollar startup Magic Leap's technology signs a hefty non-disclosure agreement, but that didn't stop Golden State small forward Andre Iguodala from talking about his experience with the secret "mixed reality" headset.

Magic Leap is a billion-dollar startup backed by Google and other major investors that is building a pair of glasses that can display advanced computer graphics in the real world.

"Magic Leap was amazing," Iguodala told CNET. "They want to do some things with sports. I don't know how you even think of doing something like that. And then the actual device is so small, the one that's going to come to market, it's almost like you have a pair of sunglasses on."

Iguodala also described a new application for Magic Leap's "mixed reality" technology: Using the headset's eye-tracking to control a smart home. The glasses could also turn virtual assistants, like Siri, into characters, Iguodala said.

Iguodala previously commented on a leaked photo of a Magic Leap prototype published by Business Insider:

The 2015 NBA Finals MVP is not the only celebrity to try Magic Leap. The Florida-based company has had a lot of high-profile entertainers try its technology, including Beyoncé.

Magic Leap has not announced when its product will go on sale. Employees expect it to cost between $1000 and $2000 when it does.|||
