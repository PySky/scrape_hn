Caojiawan subway station in Chongqing in southwest China is pictured covered in overgrown weeds and shrubbery with no major road or any kind of public transportation connected to it. It may very well look abandoned, but it’s actually a fully operational subway stop.

Located on the outskirts of Chongqing Metro’s Line 6 that links suburbs to the city’s center, the station finished construction back in 2015, according to Shanghaiist.

Caojiawan Station was originally built with three exits, but only one exit is used by commuters.

The other two station exits lead to a barren wasteland, where passengers must rely on a van service to get back home the rest of the way.

A station staff member told the Chongqing Morning Post that not many people can be seen going in and out of the station.

Here’s what it looks like during rush hour:

But compared to Beijing’s Subway Line 13 in rush hour, with thousands of commuters jam-packed on the platform waiting for the train, Caojiawan Station looks like heaven.

According to China Plus, the design of of the subway line and the construction of roads are managed by two different governmental departments.

The city planning department is reportedly keeping up with the stretches of the metro line in the future, meaning there may be a city built near Caojiawan Station one day.|||
