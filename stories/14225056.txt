Acne is the arc enemy of beauty. We crafted a soap enriched with lemon juice to help fight acne for you  the natural way. This soap is made with lemon juice, castor, olive, palm, and coconut base oils. Goat milk, babassu oil, sunflower oil, and palm kernel flakes are added to enhance soap lather and hardness. The pleasant lemony lavender scent comes from lemongrass, lemon, and lavender essential oils.|||
