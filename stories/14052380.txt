SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT not suitable to be replicated! In this experiment the mercury is placed inside a wooden disc and at the sides two aluminum wheels and at the center a magnet. When the current flows through the aluminum conductor it generates a magnetic field. This condition puts in rotation the liquid mercury being a conductive metal. The working voltage is DC 2V, 27-28A controlled by inverter. 1speaker magnet, talc powder. *The talc powder makes visible the movement of the mercury. **The system doesn't work in alternating current!|||
