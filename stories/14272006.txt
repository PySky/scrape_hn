Airports can retrieve both live and historical data about specific patterns, such as entrance and exit usage, walking routes and time spent in various areas, such as security, retail, lounges, rest rooms, gates and more.

The basic requirements for happy travelers are easy parking and check-in, speedy security processing, and comfort while waiting in airport terminals.

Documenting movement patterns is crucial to greater efficiency when planning new construction initiatives and for optimizing the position of signage, processes, retail outlets, services, and general layout, to improve the retail tenancy mix and more.

With sensors that measure the movement of passengersÂ´ mobile devices, airports can generate a cohesive passenger experience picture, including accurately measuring and predicting wait times, while simultaneously providing data about how passengers move and use the airport.|||
