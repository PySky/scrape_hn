After running 10 successful Kickstarters, we think it’s pretty safe to say that Don Moyer of Calamityware is something of an expert in running a crowdfunding campaign or two. Don and his partner Lynette Kelley were recently featured on Kickstarter’s Google+ Creators Hangout and shared quite a bit of useful, real-life experiences they encountered on their crowdfunding travels.

How did Don get involved in his first Kickstarter for the Calamity Plate 1?

Did you have a sense of where you wanted to take it, as big or small side project?

How success opened his eyes to the unexpected logistics and admin details.

How have you been able to grow the community from a few hundred to thousands?

What would “Don now” tell “Don then” doing his first project that he’s learned and to watch out for?

What made Don and Lynette reach out to sign with a fulfillment company and how has it made so much more possible?

The importance of fulfillment to customer happiness and how the right partnerships matter.
