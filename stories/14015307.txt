I don't want to be associated with a community whose members constantly drive by to projects they have no investment in to inform them of a supposedly superior message. Every time there is a post on Hacker News or Reddit about a vulnerability in C, the strike team comes out to mention a rewrite in Rust. Regardless of Rust's strengths, it's ugly, and it's also insulting to other developers.|||
