A lightweight (only 1kb gzipped) scroll animation javascript library without any dependency.

You can pass all options as data attributes with prefix. Option name should be written in kebab case format, for example:

The default options are as follows:

Start scroll animation from current position to the anchor point

Target element/position to be scrolled. Target position is the distance to the top of the page.

This is the trigger element for starting to scroll when on click.

This is the callback function to be run after the scroll complete. This will overwrite the callback option.

Ease function. See Easing Equations for more ease function.

It should work in the current stable releases of Chrome, Firefox, Safari as well as IE10 and up. To add support for older browsers, consider including polyfills/shims for the requestAnimationFrame.
