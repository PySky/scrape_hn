One day soon, we might talk to our devices the way we talk to our friends. And the devices will talk back. This fundamentally changes our relationship with technology and opens up for some very important questions.

SPACE10, IKEA’s external future living lab, are curious to learn how the many people feel about Artificial Intelligence. That is why we have launched a worldwide survey called Do You Speak Human? — encouraging people to share how they would like their future AI to be.

The project is what we label as 'playful research' and the idea is to listen to people, open up the design process and take people’s wishes, concerns and aspirations into account before even deciding how this topic should be explored further. The results of the study will continuously be updated on this site.|||
