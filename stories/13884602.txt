UPDATED: git diff works anywhere on the filesystem! Can’t believe I never just tried this. Hat tip: @johngoulah.

But note that is still useful for coloring patches (see below).

Git does very nice syntax highlighting for diffs when browsing the revision history. Colorful fonts make diffs more readable and thus reduce overall cognitive load for engineers.

It would be great if such syntax highlighting were available throughout the filesystem, not just within Git repos. And on OSX and Linux it’s easy to enable pretty-colored syntax highlighting for all your diffs and patches!

colordiff is a command line tool that colorizes diff output. Pipe the output from diff into colordiff and you’re all set.

colordiff parses and colors diff output — it doesn’t matter whether the output is on STDOUT or in a file. In the latter case, simply cat or echo the contents of your patch file, pipe it to colordiff and enjoy the resulting easier-to-read diffs!

You should be able to install colordiff using your favorite package manager or you can compile it from source.|||
