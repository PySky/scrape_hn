Data is collected by scraping the relevant websites once a day via a cron job and then stored in a Postgresql database for later retrieval. Growth rates are calculated by averaging data over the last week. I'm gathering counts of separate modules, so multiple versions of the same module/package/gem only count once (foo-1.2, foo-1.3 and bar-1.0 would count as 2 total).

(Apr 2, 2017) Added Julia to list. Thanks to Bargava Subramanian for pointing it out. Return CSV download feature.

(Mar 17, 2017) Bower and GoDoc haven't been pulling numbers for a long time, and it doesn't seem to just be a matter of the number moving somewhere new. I'm removing them both, and adding Gopm.io, which seems to be more in-line with most languages' ideas about what a package manager is. Big thanks to Jesse Aldridge for pointing me to it.

(May 30, 2016) Much thanks to Hiroki Noda for adding DUB (dlang). Fixed Hex.pm sampling, and removed link to CSV download until I can re-engineer it.

(Apr 8, 2016) Updates to Rubygems.org and Npmjs.org broke both of those samplers.

I'd like to add more repositories. If you have suggestions, please send them to erik@debill.org.

CPAN and CPAN (search) used to be two conflicting sources for data about how many modules are in CPAN. During spring of 2011 CPAN got a site refresh and the numbers came into line with each other. It looks funny on the graph, but it's an interesting bit of history.

GoDoc is weird. It's not a true package repository in the same sense as all the others, but as far as I can tell it's the closest GoLang has. Be aware that it pretty drastically overcounts the number of packages. Don't use the raw numbers to compare with other languages. You can still watch the line to see changes in velocity, though.

If you'd like to check out the data in more detail, you are welcome to download it in a CSV file.|||
