In my generalized mean post, I showed how any mean can be defined by an invertible symmetric function

If you haven’t yet read it, you might want to before reading this post.

The mathematica code to calculate means on finite sets, given , is below:

I expected it to be immensely useful for creating number-theoretic and other exotic means that are not currently defined or used within mathematics.

To make this construct of a generalized mean even more useful, we need to create a function that allows us to calculate the f-mean of an infinite set. Fold (as used above) won’t work with infinite sets, it’ll never terminate.

So let’s rewind to current mathematical knowledge. The arithmetic mean defined on an interval can be calculated using an integral. For a function on the interval , the arithmetic mean of the values of f would be

Don’t confuse this with , it is not defining a mean – we are just taking the mean of the image of .

You might be scratching your head about how we are going to perform the geometric mean if our only tool to handle infinities is the integral. Well, there’s a simple trick, if we have a sequence s, then the product of all the elements of s is:

And the mean would be:

So, we can get the geometric mean for the image of as:

Unfortunately, because we must use integrals, I know of no way to calculate the generalized f-mean on any tame infinite set (ie. analytic function image.) Instead,we still settle for the Quasi-arithmetic mean generalization, which albeit is not as powerful – but works pretty well for most uses.

So, given that defines our generalized mean via , we can define the continuous form as:

The Mathematica code is below.

Here are some examples:

A cool fact if you didn’t know. Euler’s constant, e, is involved in the geometric mean of real intervals.
