Halt and Catch Fire is one of those TV shows that is consistently compelling and fascinating, even if it hasn't caught on as much as AMC's bigger shows like The Walking Dead. Thankfully the network isn't letting that stop it from making great TV, as it has just renewed the program for a third season. The show originally started as the story of the PC-cloning revolution in Texas, with the second season moving on towards the advent of online gaming and communities. For this next installment of 10 episodes, the program will be headed straight to the heart of the industry: Silicon Valley.

Even more exciting for fans of the show, co-creators Christopher Rogers and Christopher Cantwell have been upped to showrunner status, putting them in complete charge of the program. The duo were a bit of a television success story, writing the pilot for Halt and Catch Fire as more of a TV writing sample than anything else, before meeting with AMC and finding that the network wasn't just interested in them as writers, but in the project as well.

"We are beyond thrilled to have the opportunity to continue telling this story. Halt and Catch Fire has been a passion project of ours from day one, and we are so thankful that AMC not only shares this passion, but also continues to champion bold character-driven storytelling in an increasingly crowded television landscape," the pair said in a joint statement. "Much in the way that Halt is about underdogs overcoming convention and breaking new ground, the story of season three will endeavor to further stretch the medium and challenge the form."

Halt and Catch Fire will be returning in the summer of 2016, but in the meantime you can dial up the inaugural episode of Verge ESP to hear straight from Cantwell and Rogers themselves.|||
