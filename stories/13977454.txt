Update (3/27/17 1:00pm): The House votes tomorrow on a bill to allow companies to sell your online data without your permission. Keep the pressure on and tell Congress to vote NO on S.J. Resolution 34.

I’m calling to demand Congress protect my online privacy and keep FCC broadband rules intact. Do not pass S.J. Resolution 34. I do not want internet service providers to sell my data without getting my permission.|||

Don’t let internet service providers sell your data without your permission.
