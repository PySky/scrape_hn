Apple’s Macbook Pro line up have evolved during the past years, but it hurts the design community when they have decided to discontinue the production of the 17 inches. Personally I owned the last batch of 17 inches workhorse that went through the recall of graphic card issue.

Anyhow, the current model is faster and more powerful than before, yet remarkably thinner and lighter. It has the brightest, most colorful Mac notebook display ever. And it introduces the Touch Bar – a Multi-Touch enabled strip of glass built into the keyboard for instant access to the tools you want, right when you want them. The new MacBook Pro is built on groundbreaking ideas. And it’s ready for yours.

When they have introduce this feature to the Macbook Pro, I wonder why that they are not going for the touch screen technology but then Apple has their own design initiatives.

Now, what if the touch bar on the new Macbook Pro would extend to a full-size touch pad? This question was the driving force on this concept. It would enable a lot of new features while maintaining the fundamental idea behind the MacBook Pro 2016 touch bar, serving as shortcuts and macro functions. Also, since it will be a touch enabled display, it could support the Apple pencil to allow user to finally use it with desktop applications.
