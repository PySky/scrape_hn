Raising awareness towards the prevention of security risks is challenging. Most people are unaware of or just don't have access to the right information. Keeping up the pace in the tech world is a golden rule. If you are not ready to deal with security issues, you are heading in the wrong direction.

The AppSec Ezine was born out of the need to curate contents concerning information security that otherwise one may find scattered across the web. Each edition covers a wide range of topics. The AppSec Ezine is focussed on providing information about problems you should be aware of (old or new issues) and giving you an overview of the latest hot topics - curiosities that get you through your daily work or ignite your passion on the topic.

There are no prerequisites to reading the AppSec Ezine. It is for wannabes, n00bs, l33ts or gurus. No matter if you are the very best of your field or just someone interested in security, you will still find something new and cool to learn.

If you have a security program running, mailing list or any group that think this will be welcome, feel free to use and redistribute. It will be released every week usually on a Friday morning via Twitter. Looking for a dump? GitHub.
