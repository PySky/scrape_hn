Tools to turn .NET libraries into native libraries that can be consumed on Android, iOS, Mac, Linux and other platforms.

Embeddinator-4000 is a tool that allows your existing .NET Code (C#, F# and others) to be consumed from other programming languages and in various different environments.

This means that if you have a .NET library that you want to use from your existing iOS app, you can do that. Or if you want to link it with a native C++ library, you can also do that. Or consume .NET code from Java.

The tool is both aware of the environment it will use, as well as the language that will consume it. For example, the iOS platform does not allow just-in-time (JIT) compilation, so the embeddinator will statically compile your .NET code into native code that can be used in iOS. Other environments do allow JIT compilation, and in those enviroments, we opt to JIT compile.

It supports various language consumers, so it surfaces .NET code as idiomatic code in the target language. This is the list of language support that we have been working on:

More languages will come later.

To get started, check one of our guides for each of the currently supported languages:
