On this episode of Tire Rack’s Head 2 Head (http://www.tirerack.com), we travel to the frozen, snow-covered Bridgestone Winter Driving School to test two high-performance SUVs. MOTOR TREND Senior Features Editors Jason Cammisa and Jonny Lieberman pit the Porsche Macan GTS against the Jaguar F-Pace S in a series of handling and acceleration challenges. Rumor has it that Jaguar delayed the F-Pace’s introduction until it was a worthy competitor of the spectacular Macan, so we find out how it stacks up. Each vehicle has a forced-induction 3.0L V-6 and a rear-biased all-wheel-drive system.

Which is better? There’s only one way to find out.|||
