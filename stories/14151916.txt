Racing sims have been around for longer than you think. Even back in the 1980s, people were racing virtually in the hopes they'd one day hop into the driver's seat for real. This video from Donut Media takes us through how sim racing evolved from a primitive, pixelated novelty into one of motorsports' most useful tools.

It all started in 1983 with Chequered Flag. Complete with three available tracks and three different cars to choose from, it was highly entertaining for its time, and set the bar for racing simulators from that point on.

As the years went on a slew of different simulators were released, each more advanced than the last. Soon every game had realistic car controls, lighting, and even damage simulation.

Now, sims like Project CARS and Assetto Corsa are taking games to the next level with hyper-realistic physics and varying weather conditions. Racers around the world use games like these and others to learn tracks, giving them an edge they wouldn't have any other way.

Watch for yourself to see how simple racing games of the '80s turned into a vital tool for drivers everywhere.|||
