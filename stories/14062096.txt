An Open Source Re-Implementation of Generals: Zero Hour

This project is a bottom-up rewrite of Generals: Zero Hour, using the original binary in place of not-yet-implemented functions. The intention is to allow the fixing of bugs, implementation of new features and porting to platforms unsupported by the original.

This project currently supports building on Visual Studio or MinGW-w64. Use CMake to generate a solution outside of the src directory. For example, when using the CMake GUI and the source is at C:\path\to\thyme set the build path to C:\path\to\thyme\build. Note that although you can use MingGW-w64 to build thyme, the dll built by it will not work correctly as the GCC ABI does not match that used in the the original binary. Once clang can build with exceptions for Windows, it should be possible to use that with MinGW-w64 to get the correct ABI. This limitation will not apply once the re-implementation is complete.

To run the game, you need to first have Generals: Zero Hour installed. The easiest way to get the game to run is to place both and in the same directory as . You can then launch from the directory, or use a shortcut to to launch the game. Currently only the original disc based install patched to version 1.04 is supported, though adding the from that version to a TFD or Origin install should also allow those to work. When the project is complete, this restriction will not apply.

Native support for Linux and macOS is planned for the future, but because of how the project is developed, a native binary will not be possible for some time. In the mean time, using Wine on Linux and macOS, should be possible but is currently untested.

The source code provided in this repository for Thyme is licenced under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later with an exception allowing the resulting code to be linked against a closed source binary which will be in place until Thyme no longer relies on the original.
