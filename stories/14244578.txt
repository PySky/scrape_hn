Yes, it is a great distro right out of the box (even added support for Realtek’s RTL8812AU wireless chipsets), but there are a few things that you can do to make it even more versatile. You can customize it to better meet your needs. If you want to add encrypted containers to secure your data, you can add TrueCrypt’;s replacement VeraCrypt. If you want to build your own lab environment, you can add VirtualBox. There are a lot of things you can do. Below, I will walk through a few things that I would personally suggest to make life a little easier and build on the already robust Kali distribution.

Here are some suggested things to do after you download.

– Add the user to the SUDOers group

– Find the part of the file that is labeled “User privilege specification”.

 – Find where it says “root ALL=(ALL) ALL”.

 – Type “o” to insert a new line below it.

 – Now type what you want to insert, eg “newuser ALL=(ALL) ALL”.

 – The file should look like:

 # User privilege specification

 root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

 newuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

 – Hit esc to exit insert-mode.

 – Type “:x” to save and exit.

– now to compare the new keys with the old ones to make sure they are different

– If they don’t match, remove them

* add MultiArch for i386 support if you have the 64bit OS

 * install libreoffice (office suite, great for report writing)

 * install clamav (antivirus)

 * install virtualbox (virtual machine environment)

 * install openvas (vulnerability scanner)

If you want to vew the change log: view the change log here.  Now that you’ve added a few things to Kali, let the fun begin.

P.S. I would suggest logging out of root and in the the “newuser” you created. Any time you need to run something at a higher privilege, use “sudo program”. For example:
