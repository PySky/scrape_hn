employs the `missile coordinate' fields in the USENET map database and Internet connections to a server interfaced with AUTOVON to lob nuclear weapons at other UNIX sites, specified by name. The default warhead is a single 25KT groundburst tac nuke; options support other combinations of warhead size, type and deployment. The -y option specifies a yield. The argument must be a number suffixed by K or M, for kiloton or megaton respectively. Yield arguments above 255M are quietly ignored. The -a option specifies an air-burst height in meters. The -h option specifies thermonuclear (hydrogen) weapons. The -c option specifies cobalt-jacketed warheads for permanent site interdiction. The -m option, useful with multiple-site calls, invokes code which optimizes delivery using MIRVed warheads to minimize launches. In accordance with the normal UNIX design philosophy does not prevent you from nuking yourself. If a target site has given only nearest-city coordinates in its map entry, incorrect targeting and significant collateral casualties may result. Heavy use of may cause EMP effects which interfere with Internet service. This command is restricted to super-users only.|||
