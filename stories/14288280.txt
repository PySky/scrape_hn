If you are interested in doing personalized relocation research by state, so far, I have only found one service that let's you look at a map of homes by state with home listings. That service is Zillow.Here is a sample of search for "homes for sale Alaska." Zillow gives me a map of the state with actual home listings. Homes.com gives me a box that asks me to search by city, zip or address. Realtor.com gives me a list of cities and counties in Alaska. Trulia gives me a list of cities and a census overview.If I am trying to get some idea of what real estate is like for a state, I want a map and actual listings like Zillow provides. I don't want to be told I must narrow my search further to get any information.If you have a use case such as retirement or another situation where you have portable income but are not rich, being able to search different states and narrow the parameters by metrics like number of rooms and price point is very valuable. It can save tons of time on trying to get a general idea of housing cost and housing options in different states without having to repeat the same search many times to sample multiple cities.When I do research for myself, I am typically looking for information on different states first. This is not how most research services work. They tend to drill down to the city level. This is out of step with how most Americans seem to do their relocation research. Often, they start by looking at tax burden by state, then try to narrow their search to the city level after picking a state.|||
