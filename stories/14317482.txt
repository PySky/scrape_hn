Weâ€™re REALLY excited about this announcement and think many of you will be too ðŸ˜‰

On May 11th 2017, during Microsoftâ€™s Build conference keynote, Terry Myerson (EVP for Windows & Devices Group) made several announcements about the Windows Subsystem for Linux:

And at OSCON 2017 I delivered a talk on the architecture and history of Bash/WSL, and outlined these new features. Thanks to the great OSCON audience & attendees for all your great support & engagement ðŸ™‚

These new features deliver several key benefits including:

WSL was always designed to be distro-agnostic and this is the first time weâ€™re exercising this aspect of the system. As always, we greatly appreciate any testing you can help us with, and if you find problems, please file bugs in our GitHub issues repo. We canâ€™t wait to hear how you get on installing via the store and running different and multiple distroâ€™s!

These new features will arrive in an up-coming Windows Insider build. If youâ€™d like to be among the first to try-out these new distroâ€™s, be sure to sign-up for the Windows Insider program, and configure your Win10 machine to install fast-ring builds.|||
