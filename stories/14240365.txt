I initially set to a goal to release 6 issues of Dope Discoveries, but Iâ€™m gonna keep going at it. I set a new goal to deliver another 6 issues ðŸ˜Ž

Last month I told you about my new instagram account, a Podcast a Day, where I make daily podcast recommendations. I also love the insane amount of knowledge I gain from podcasts that a couple of weeks ago I started a new websiteâ€Šâ€”â€ŠPodcast Breakdown.

I love podcasts and listen to hundreds of them a year. When I stumble upon ones packed with knowledge, I like to do a podcast breakdown. That helps me process and retain the information, and gives me the ability to refer back to what was covered ðŸ¤“

I created the podcast breakdown as a guide for other listeners (or even non-listeners). The guide will help you follow conversations more easily, identify technical terms discussed, review ideas and materials, and will directly link to products, people or other relevant content mentioned.|||
