At CoreOS we know that building truly innovative software is rooted in the understanding of differing perspectives. At our conferences and within our community we celebrate our differences and recognize the need to include people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, sexual orientation, and military service.

As we work to secure the internet, we work equally hard to honor all parts of the human spirit and create an environment where all human beings can thrive. To this end, we are offering Scholarship Opportunities to attend CoreOS Fest 2017. This scholarship is being awarded because we believe that our conference, work and communities are better when they include folks from all groups.

Our goal is to award 3 scholarships this year. The application deadline is May 18th. Scholarships will be awarded on May 20th. Weâ€™re happy to answer additional questions. Contact us at fest@coreos.com.

Application dealine is May 18, 2017. All applicants will be notified of their application's status by May 22nd. Scholarship recipients will receive additional information on how to register for the conference.|||
