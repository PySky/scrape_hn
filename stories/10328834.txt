The Disney research team in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, recently released a pretty amazing demo that shows that coloring books may be about to change in a big way. They found a way to track real-life coloring from a traditional book and bring it to life on a mobile device.

As you can see on the above gif or in the video demo under, you can see the animal coming to life and move while having its pants filled with color. At last, you get a sight of what augmented reality can look for children. Crayola already published an app that brough color books to life, but this takes it to a whole new level.|||
