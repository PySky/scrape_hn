Researchers at the University of California Berkeley , after following 3,342 adolescents into adulthood and examining their BMI and bedtimes concluded that teens and adults who are getting more sleep are less likely to gain weight than those staying up late at night.

Researched found that for every hour of sleep the participants lost, they gained 2.1 points on the BMI index (Healthy BMI = 18.5-24.9). This study can be important for weight management in adolescents and adults.

Researches also suggest that 70% of high school students don’t get enough sleep (9-10 hours recommended).
