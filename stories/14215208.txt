The ElectricFlow Community Edition is a free, full feature version of ElectricFlow. The Community Edition provides teams with an easy way to quickly spin up an ElectricFlow server and become productive in no time – on their path to transforming their software releases and streamlining their DevOps efforts.

We are continuing to introduce new ways to get started with the Community Edition using the technology stack or platform provider of your choice. We’ve recently announced ElectricFlow’s availability as a Docker container, and now I’m happy to announce it’s also available on the Azure marketplace.

For any Microsoft Azure users – you can now start up an ElectricFlow instance with a click of a button! Sign up below to use ElectricFlow on Azure:
