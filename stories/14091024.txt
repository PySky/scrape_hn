Teleport is a modern SSH server designed for teams managing distributed infrastructure. You can read more about Teleport on its website or online documentation.

The new features in Teleport 2.0 are:

In addition to these improvements to the open source distribution of Teleport, we are releasing a commercial version of Teleport, called Teleport Enterprise. This commercial release will include features that make it easier for large organizations to manage Teleport, including:

Teleport 2.0 is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the 1.x series. However, it is always recommended to make a backup of the cluster state prior to replacing the binary with a new version. The cluster state is located in directory for filesystem-based deployments. Users of the backend should use command to accomplish this.

We are working with an independent auditor to conduct a security audit of Teleport v2.0 and Teleport Enterprise and they will be publishing the resulting audit in April 2017. The last audit we conducted was just prior to the release of v1.0 so we believe it is prudent to conduct another audit at this time.

For more information about Teleport, you can take a look at the documentation or the Github repo. It is open sourced so feel free to dig in; issues and/or pull requests are welcome. Feel free to reach out if you have additional questions: [email protected].|||
