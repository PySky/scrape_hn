I’m sure you’ve heard this question many times:  Is the glass half-empty or half-full?

The theory is, that if you’re an optimist you’ll see the glass as half-full, while if you’re a pessimist you’ll see it as half-empty.

Technically, both answers are correct.  Whether you can really tell if someone is an optimist or a pessimist by the answer to this question is beyond my area of expertise.

A Different Way to See It

Here’s how I actually look at that glass.

Now, you may be thinking I’m crazy, and who knows, you just might be right.  Please let me explain.

The glass is half-full of water.  However, the other half of the glass is full of air.

You may think this is silly, but here’s what I’m thinking.  When you see the glass as full of both water and air, you’ve changed your perception.  You’re looking beyond the obvious.  You’ve opened your mind to other possibilities.

Break Out of the Rut

The next time you find your thinking stuck, look beyond the obvious.  Is there another way you can look at a particular problem?  Can you change your perception of the situation?  Let your mind wander and be open to other possibilities besides the obvious ones.|||
