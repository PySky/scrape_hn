How do you improve your User Experience? Well, you have to think past the whole ‘Make it so damn pretty the user will fall in love and tell all their friends (on Dribbble)’ kind of mindset. This just isn’t the way anymore. You can create something so staggeringly beautiful you think it should be hung in the Louvre. But if you don’t take into account how the user will actually interact with your product, what they expect to happen when they use it, the real UX basics, then you may as well pull it from the wall at the Louvre, and pop it in the garbage chute. It’s purely aesthetics for aesthetics purposes. What’s expected of a modern day UI/UX Designer is a whole lot more than what was expected say 2 or 3 years ago. There’s a whole lot more to learn, but this brief article by Thanasis Rigopoulos covers some of the key things that will improve your User Experience.

A good user experience should feel familiar, something like when you get up at night to go to the bathroom and all the lights are turned off and somehow you managed to navigate through and made it to the bathroom, why? because it is your house and it is familiar to you, you know where each and everything is.|||
