I2C is a two-wire bus developed by Philips used for connecting integrated circuits. It is commonly used for connecting devices such as EEPROMs, temperature sensors, fan controllers, real-time clocks, tuners, and other types of integrated circuits.Thedriver provides a uniform programming interface layer between I2C master controllers and various I2C slave devices. Each I2C master controller attaches anframework; several slave devices can then be attached to thebus.All I2C slave devices are uniquely identified by the address on the bus. The master accesses a particular slave device using its address. Devices are found on the bus using a sophisticated scanning routine which attempts to identify commonly available devices. On other machines (such as sparc64 and macppc) where the machine ROM supplies a list of I2C devices, that list is used instead.System Management Bus (SMBus) protocol is also supported by emulating it with the I2C commands.The I2C framework first appeared insupport was added in. I2C bus scanning was added inThe I2C framework was written by Steve C. Woodford and Jason R. Thorpe forand then ported toby grange@openbsd.org >.|||
