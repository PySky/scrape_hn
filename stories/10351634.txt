Panasonic claims to have toppled a world record for module efficiency announced only days ago by SolarCity and will be demonstrating the new module at next week’s Solar Energy UK exhibition organised by PV Tech's publisher, Solar Media.

Last Friday SolarCity announced it had recorded 22.04% efficiency in a rooftop module from its pilot line, however this morning Panasonic has revealed its recorded module conversion efficiency of 22.5% on a commercial-sized prototype module, verified by the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.

Panasonic said the new record built on cell-level efficiencies of 25.6% recorded last year. “The new panel efficiency record demonstrates once again Panasonic’s proven leadership in photovoltaics and our ongoing commitment to move the needle in advanced solar technology,” said Daniel Roca, senior business developer at Panasonic Eco Solutions Europe.

The technology manufacturer has also announced the launch of its new HIT N330 module, a 96-cell, 330W panel which features 19.7% module-level efficiency and claims to deliver 27% more peak-power compared to mainstream 260W multicrystalline modules.

Both products will be on show at next week’s SEUK expo, held at Birmingham’s NEC.|||
