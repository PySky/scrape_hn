Although the Samsung smaller 14 nm chip was regarded to be faster and energy efficient. Live test results seems to show different.

TWO Live test results from a China site using two 64GB iPhone 6S bought from Australia running iOS 9.0.2 are put to test

Shows the Samsung chip would consume more battery, around 20%

Shows the phone with TSMC chip beats the Samsung chip in the benchmark tests (not a lot, but faster is faster)

Also shows the Samsung Chip is averagely hotter (40°) while the TSMC recorded (37°)
