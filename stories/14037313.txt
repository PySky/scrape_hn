Nothing quite beats an on-site pair programming session in my opinion. Given the logistical hurdles that need to be overcome for this however, led me to collate a list of interesting questions that should be asked at the end of a technical interview to get the most information regarding the job on offer.

The questions given are in no particular order and may also be woven into conversation depending upon the interview.

Note: there exists a Joel Test to determine the quality of a software team and there is some overlap here but I choose to frame my questions more open-ended to create a discussion space.

I wish you all the very best in your interviews and I hope that you found these useful. I am always happy to get your feedback - feel free to get in touch!|||
