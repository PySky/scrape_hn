Usually, Cortana the personal assistant is just a disembodied voice. One Halo fan decided to take his Cortana to the next level by building a rad hologram appliance that responds to your queries.

The whole thing is still a work in progress, creator Jarem “untitled network” Archer says, but it’s still pretty cool to watch it in action:

The animations were built with a Unity 3D app, while the lights controlled by a built-in Arduino. The device can also track your face, so Cortana is always looking in the right direction.

How long until Microsoft also goes the hologram route for Cortana, you think?
