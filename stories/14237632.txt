Researchers are making good progress in controlling machines just by thinking. This leads us into the world of Brain Computer Interfaces using which we can connect our brains to machines and transmit control signals. Much of this is still in the realm of deep technical research and many years behind actual applications, but scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs are coming together to build this exciting thing of the future. 

Here's a collection of resources on what is a BCI, basics of neural functions, different ways researchers are trying to make effective BCIs and the challenges they face and how the progress looks like (prototypes).
