is a cli utility to help get your secrets into vault

It leverages the transit secret backend to protect your secrets locally in a yaml formatted secrets file and facilitates pushing the secrets stored in this file into a specified path of the generic secret backend.

Since the values in your secrets file are encrypted with vault's transit backend, you can commit these files to source control. This allows you to be more deliberate about tracking and publishing the sensitive data needed to run your applications.

Hard coding tokens etc. is only suitable for dev. See Installing Vault for complete install instructions|||
