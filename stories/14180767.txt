SILICON COWBOYS is a documentary following the rise and fall of Compaq, a startup who created one of the first 100% IBM PC compatible systems. Director Jason Cohen and Compaq co-founder Joseph “Rod” Canion share a clip from the film and discuss how Compaq Computer set out to build a portable PC to take on IBM, the world’s most powerful tech company at the time. Canion also recalls where the idea for the portable computer came from and provides advice for future tech entrepreneurs in this SXSW edition of BYOD hosted by Ondi Timoner. 



FILM & GUEST BIO:

SILICON COWBOYS explores the remarkable David vs. Goliath story, and eventual demise, of Compaq, an unlikely upstart who altered the future of computing and helped shape the world as we know it today. Directed by Oscar®-nominated director Jason Cohen, the film offers a fresh look at the explosive rise of the 1980's PC industry and is a refreshing alternative to the familiar narratives of Jobs, Gates, and Zuckerberg.

Director Jason Cohen has produced and directed all formats of film and television on projects that cover a broad range of topics over the past 20 years. Cohen’s FACING FEAR, a story of forgiveness between a former Neo-Nazi and the victim of his hate crime attack 25 years earlier, was nominated for an Oscar® for best documentary short subject.

Joseph Rodney "Rod" Canion is an American computer scientist and businessman. Canion is a co-founder of Compaq Computer Corporation where he served as its first President and CEO.
