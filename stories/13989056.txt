Today we’ll take a look at an IoT pressure gauge for your Minio server. This is a cool hack built by Alex Ellis with the Raspberry Pi, Docker and Minio.

In this post we give a live demo, then go over the bill of materials, a high-level diagram and finally link out to the source-code on Github so you can try this for yourself.

Here is a video of the Pressure Gauge in action.

The Blinkt! costs around 5USD and was created by Pimoroni in the UK as a cheap and effective output for IoT projects. Through a simple Python or Golang library you can program 8 RGB LEDs and build fun projects.

Alex put together a talk and demo for Dockercon last year called Protecting the Datacenter with IoT. It consisted of half a dozen Raspberry Pi sensors and Blinkts all connected through Docker and Redis to provide real-time alerts about thermal issues and tampering straight from your server room. You can see a live video of the demo and talk from Container Camp, London here.|||
