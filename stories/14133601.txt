A platform in a broader sense is a set of tool and services which enable developers to develop and run an application. The term IoT platform could have different meaning based on whom you are talking to in the IoT ecosystem. For hardware vendors, embedded boards are the IoT platform where you could write your IoT applications. For cloud service providers, their infrastructure is an IoT platform where the developer will consume data from the sensor and create an application. For the sake of the clarity, we refer to the IoT platform as the middleware layer responsible for consuming data from sensor and devices and producing meaningful result and actions based on that insight. IoT platform often offers device SDK or well defined APIs through which developers could connect any hardware platform and consume their cloud-based services.

Following picture illustrates the complexity of current IoT ecosystem and why choosing the right IoT platform is extremely difficult.

If you've recently attended an IoT expo, you would notice that almost every IoT platform provider claims to be faster, better and smarter than others. There are many impressive customer references behind every platform backed up with jaw dropping case studies. How could you make a smarter decision and reduce your solution risk in such a competitive landscape?|||
