If you have worked with large elasticsearch mappings then you may have encountered this problem, that there is no possibility to comment your mapping. As the elasticsearch mapping is defined in JSON, which does not allow to add comments.

I thought the same until i stumbled upon following elasticsearch issue. Where a single line was added to the configuration.

Ain’t that cool. This happened only as the elasticsearch uses the JSON parser from FasterXML. Which supports this feature to do comments in JSON. Check their wiki page where it’s described as follows.

ALLOW_COMMENTS (default: false) (for textual formats with concept of comments) For textual formats that do not have official comments, but for which “de facto” conventions exist (like JSON), determines whether use of such unofficial comments is allowed or not

 Supported for: JSON

 For JSON: enabling the feature allows recognition and handling of “C comments” (/* … */) and “C++ comments” (// ….)

This feature of doing comments on elasticsearch works well but with some exceptions.

So following mapping is absolutely fine.|||
