As Jason Yau, Director of Marketing at Colorescience says:

‘Selecting the right color has been the leading issue for customers since we started the survey. We were already in the process of redesigning our site, so we used the data to build a Foundation Finder that makes it easier for customers to select the appropriate foundation color and format (liquid, pressed mineral, loose mineral) for their skin by selecting from a gallery of models.

After the launch of our new site, the post-purchase survey was able to show the gains that we had made in helping women select the ideal foundation shade, while also telling us that it was still an area of opportunity for other products on the site. Based on that, we designed color selection charts for the other products on our site to further address the issue.

With Survicate’s survey technology, we’ve made big strides in improving the customer experience in this and other areas’.|||
