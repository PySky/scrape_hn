A few things have happened during the last months. A website went live and we rolled out quite a few updates. Here is a short summary.

We have launched a new website. First, we found it was time to come up with a much nicer website that uses up-to-date technology. Second, the old website focused on Duplicati 1.3.4. We felt it was time to make a switch now and get Duplicati 2.0 rolled out. We still call it experimental,but the website change is a first step to getting it out (the more users, the more confidence).

A few versions have been rolled with many changes. Here is a short summary of the highlights up to version 2.0.1.23:

We still get asked, when Duplciati 2.0 will be released as stable version. We have a large user base and a bit hesitant to declare Duplicati 2.0 as stable. If you are using the experimental version right now and think, it deserves to be called “beta” or “stable”, please let us know.|||
