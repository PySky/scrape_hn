With the launch of the new TO DO app by Microsoft I decided to try and clean up my Microsoft accounts. That’s when I discovered a really stupid issue:

I decided to switch from a seperate skype account I was using to one that was connected to my Microsoft account — one login for all their services I thought, it just makes sense.

I only really chat with like 2 people on Skype anyway.

That’s when I noticed that the Skype account attached to my Microsoft account is this:

That’s a problem. Having the company name after my name implies I work for that company. I no longer do.

I thought, no biggie, I’ll just change the username to just be my first and last name.

I am allowed to change my display name, but the username will continue to be the above.

Whatever, I think, I’ll just go ahead and unlink that Skype account and make a new one with proper details, maybe even delete the old one.

Because it’s “merged” to my Microsoft account I can’t delete it or unlink it.

I contacted support and their suggestion was to delete my entire Microsoft account (which will take 2 months to do!) and then let me know one little thing: I can’t use my email address I used for this account. So I can’t use the email I use for everything on my new Microsoft account.

Microsoft — this defeats the entire purpose of having one account for everything.

My only option here is to go nuclear, kill the whole account and start with a brand new email. Which means I’ll never check that email and miss all the important updates and crap you want to send me.

Two simple little things could solve this:|||
