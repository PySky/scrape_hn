Forget about botox or plastic surgery: if your face gets hit by a high energy particle beam—and you survive the event—your face will stay forever young. This is what happened to physicist Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski, the only person ever to put his head in an active particle accelerator.

It happened to him 19 years ago at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, Russia, when he stuck his head in the Synchrotron U-70 particle accelerator. He got hit by a particle beam that could have killed him. Instead, he survived and half of his face stayed in the same state as it was 19 years go. You can see in the photo that, while half of the face (left) kept getting older and wrinkly, the one of the right stayed exactly the same.|||
