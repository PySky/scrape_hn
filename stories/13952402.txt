No aim? No worries! That’s because YouTuber Mark Rober, along with his friend John, has come up with an ingenious system that is able to track a dart thrown at a board held on a set of slides, and automatically reposition itself so you hit the bullseye nearly every time.

The setup uses six infrared cameras to track the dart’s motion, then calculates a final position using an NVIDIA TX1 development kit. The dartboard is then pulled into position via six stepper motors, and keeps adjusting as the dart flies, giving you superhuman — or at least pro level abilities.
