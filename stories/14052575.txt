A lot of things do not work the way you want to. They work the Salesforce way. One of the major things I hate it is distribution of code and found it highly unnecessary. Apex class, triggers, process builders, workflow, formula fields and what not. This makes it highly unstable.

 

 Anyways, coming to the point, we want to restrict the number of products you can choose from the price book. I tried using validations but didn't really work. After a lot of swaying around, I used a trigger. It looks absurd but somehow works.

There could be other ways but I found this to be the really dependable. If you know a better way, please mention it in the comments. :)

If you look at stackoverflow survey , Salesforce and Sharepoint will feature in two most dreaded platforms to work on. It is a survey by developers and I couldn't agree more. I avoided working on them but as luck turned side, I had to work on Salesforce project and soon enough, I found out the justification for the hate and frustration around.So at the time of saving a product to Opportunity, you can simply check if there are more products already. Though the logic looks shady but somehow works. You can also put it in a ton of other logic for product selection. For example you can implement filter based on the version of the products chosen.This is how the screen looks when you choose multiple products and try adding them to opportunity.This trigger works in all scenarios.|||
