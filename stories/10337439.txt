The semantics of this CSS have been kept the same, but the extraneous whitespace has been removed, the identifiers compressed, and unnecessary definitions purged from the stylesheet. This gives you a much smaller CSS for production use.

But donâ€™t just take our word for it; why not try out css-size , a module especially created to measure CSS size before & after minification.|||
