Microsoft is making the final version of its Windows 10 Creators Update available early for those who want to install the update ahead of its general availability. While the software giant hasn’t officially confirmed Windows 10 build 15063 as the final Creators Update, sources familiar with the company’s plans tell The Verge that Microsoft is referring to this build number as Release to Manufacturing (RTM) internally.

Neowin has spotted ISO files for Windows 10 build 15063 on Microsoft’s servers, following a release to the fast and slow rings for Windows Insiders. This particular build will be released generally next month, with some reports suggesting the Windows 10 Creators Update could be available during April’s Patch Tuesday on April 11th.

If you’re looking to upgrade early and feel comfortable downloading an ISO file then you can simply mount the file in Windows 10’s File Explorer and run the setup.exe to get the latest Creators Update. More experienced Windows users will also be able to use the ISO file to clean install Windows 10 Creators Update.

Microsoft is expected to release further patches and bug fixes for Windows 10 build 15063, but these will be delivered on Windows Update as cumulative updates with the 15063.xxxx build number. Microsoft is also using the same 15063 build for its Xbox One update which is expected to be made available next month.
