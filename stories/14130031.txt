Some items up for discussion: Format for the concentrator upwards, including for long-term persistent storage, use of MQTT, JSON with UCUM, etc. Security between leaf and concentrator, and beyond, including stuff encrypted at the leaf and that tunnels though the concentrator, ie that it cannot decode. Investigate hub/leaf 'pairing' further, eg based on the radios turned down low and/or LED+photosensor and/or strange button pattern following the simple Bluetooth pairing schemes such as for headsets. Consider associating unique long-lived possibly-routable IPv6 addr with each concentrator and use it as the unique concentrator ID.

Sample of logged current JSON messages from OpenTRV leaf nodes, using JSON libraries at Arduino/leaf and Java/server ends:

See the IRC transcript for the session of the evening of 2014/11/27.

Some decisions from the IRC chat: [Decision] It is not necessary to send all fields (key/value pairs) from each leaf (ie for all its sensors) each time; especially it makes sense to send infrequently-changing values less often (and nominally support a set of fields much larger than one frame) to save some bandwidth and provide more flexibility, especially for less-efficient encodings such as JSON.|||
