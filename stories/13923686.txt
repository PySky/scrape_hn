My Axios colleague Mike Allen will be interviewing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin this Friday morning in Washington, D.C., for our debut News Shapers event. Topics could include everything from his role in tax reform to his role in Suicide Squad (yeah, that's on Treas Sec). You can RSVP by going here.

• Vendor machine: Quanergy, a Silicon Valley-based "unicorn" best known for its LiDAR sensors, is among the hundreds of companies that have expressed interest in helping to build Trump's southern border wall, per an Axios review of federal records. No additional information was provided, nor did Quanergy respond to a request for comment. Three notes:

 Quanergy appears to be the only VC-backed startup listed as an "interested vendor," although an angel-backed company called Repperio (Virginia-based contracting analytics platform) is in there. Being an "interested vendor" does not necessarily mean that an actual bid is forthcoming. Need proof? Both CNN and NPR also are listed as interested vendors, most likely when junior researchers pressed the wrong button while accessing the system (it was very confusing). Quanergy has raised around $150 million in funding, most recently at a post-money valuation of around $1.6 billion. Backers include Sensata Technologies, Delphi Automotive, Samsung Ventures, Rising Tide Fund, Motus Ventures, Alrai Capital and GP Capital. It is led by co-founder and CEO Louay Eldada, who is a Lebanese immigrant. • Drill down: Credit Suisse says that around "30 privately held drillers, oil field service companies and pipeline operators could go public this year in transactions worth a total $8.5 billion," per a report on the Houston Chronicle's FuelFix blog. That would be around a 4x increase over last year's total. • Drawn out: Crickets currently coming from the Time Inc. sale process, which would suggest that the board is in active discussions with either a prospective buyer or investor (an alternative, of course, being that the silence is only designed to keep the share price artificially high). I do hear that David Pecker, the Trump pal whose American Media owns the National Enquirer, was brought around to select staffers within the past few weeks. As you might imagine, it didn't go so well from the editorial point of view. It's unclear if Pecker still has any interest, after last week he agreed to buy People rival US Weekly from Wenner Media. Similar visits from Edgar Bronfman Jr., who subsequently dropped out of the process, were better received. • Re-Demo Day: Last week we discussed how former Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad had raised $7 million for his new startup, Rippling. We also noted that Y Combinator was among the investors, which made more sense when Conrad appeared yesterday on the YC Demo Day stage. He spoke briefly with Kia about why the 3-time founder opted to again go through the accelerator program. • Off-demand: As we await the next subtweet to emerge from the Uber-Jeff Jones mess, it reminds me of how Uber has done such a phenomenal job of "hard" marketing (i.e., recruiting users and drivers) and such a lousy job of "soft" marketing (i.e., creating conditions whereby it receives the benefit of the doubt). What's kind of ironic, of course, is that Jones ― the former CMO at Target ― was widely viewed as someone who would help with the latter, even though it wasn't in his formal job description. It's also not helping that the company is keeping its senior execs (including top female leaders) under PR bubble-wrap.

Jellyvision, a Chicago-based maker of an employee communications platform called ALEX, has raised $20 million in growth equity funding from Updata Partners. Existing shareholders include Jackson Square Ventures. Why it's the BFD: In part as a reward for writing the most amusing press release I've seen in quite some time. Highlights: Jellyvision is a 100-year-old tech company, give or take 85 years. Following the tragic death of the CD-ROM software market, the company pivoted. More importantly, that pivot is legit. Jellyvision began life as an educational software company that quickly morphed into the gaming company responsible for such late 90s hits as You Don't Know Jack and the CD-ROM version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. The visual and writing creatives teams stuck together and turned into a project-based marketing agency whose output often reflected the "question and response" aspects of its games. Eventually a client asked for help explaining healthcare plans to employees, which led to the current ALEX SaaS platform ― whose 800 enterprise customers include more than 80 in the Fortune 500. Bottom line: "We ride on top of or next to the enrollment platform, so we're not really competing against them." ― Jellyvision CMO Bob Armour, who adds that the company is cash-flow positive.
