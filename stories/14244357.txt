It may not be a good idea to write this post. The existing competition got wind of fman. Other people have started to create fman clones. This "negative attention" is the flip side of the interest fman is getting recently.

So why share sensitive numbers? This blog has always been very open. It shouldn't stop just because others are watching. Unless you are the competition, I think you are reading this because you want to follow fman's story. This post is for you.

This commitment to transparency is inspired by people like Pieter Levels. He's a young and very successful internet entrepreneur. In fact, he wrote about transparency just two weeks ago. He argues people appreciate it when you present yourself honestly, without creating an artificial "image" of yourself / your startup. He uses this video as an example:

It's a pretty good tune! And I bet you didn't expect to see a rap video on a file manager blog today ;-) Also very cool is that Pieter recently started using fman.

fman has sold 232 licenses so far. Some were sold in USD, others in EUR. At today's exchange rate, it would be $3199 before Stripe fees and taxes. I've so far spent 1382 hours working on fman. This puts my hourly wage (before fees and taxes) at a rumbling $2.31 per hour. ðŸ’ª

If fman is to (sustainably) succeed, it needs to at least make the above x10 each year. Given that much of the sales happened during fman's time-limited launch, this will not be easy.

The motivation for the project is thus not money. (How would you feel if you earned $2.31 per hour?) It's my (almost fanatical) vision that there should be a better file manager.

You should support fman if you like it. It takes literally one minute. You get rid of the annoying nag screen and priority when it comes to feature requests: 23 of the 40 last changes were implemented for licensed users. Don't wait. Get a license now!|||
