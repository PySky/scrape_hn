Tesla is voluntarily recalling 53,000 Model S and Model X electric vehicles because of problems with the parking brake. As was the case for Tesla's last recall, the company is blaming someone else for the issue. Specifically, the electric parking brakes installed on the EVs "may contain a small gear that could have been manufactured improperly by our third-party supplier."

Unlike the seatbelt recall that affected 90,000 Model S EVs or the Model X recall for faulty rear seats, this issue does not appear to cause a safety risk in the event of a crash. Rather, Tesla says that should the gear break, the car will be stuck with the parking brake on, and therefore will be unable to move.

Quality control issues have plagued the young carmaker. Both the Wall Street Journal and Consumer Reports lambasted the Model X, and many electric motors in early Model S sedans appeared unable to last more than 60,000 miles.

Yet these reliability issues don't seem to bother many Tesla owners. In the comments to a Tesla article yesterday, a poster describes how his Tesla experiences "repeated uncommanded braking" events after a recent software update and then describes it as "the best car I've ever owned."

If your Model S or Model X was built between February and October 2016, Tesla will be contacting you soon with an official recall notice. The company says the recall should be completed by October 2017.|||

Quality and reliability problems continue to plague the electric car maker.
