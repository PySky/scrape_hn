How to build a Weex app for the Web, Android and iOS!

If you read The State of Weex: an inaccurate and outdated report, you learned that there was no clear path to make a Weex VueJS app that would build for the web, Android and iOS.

Well… now there is! Let’s do it!

OK… maybe we should set the proper expectations here. Weex still has a lot of rough edges. This tutorial will not end a deployable production app. You will, however, see a simple Weex Vue2.0 app working on the browser and on your phone. And that’s a pretty good milestone.

We will need vue-cli to install the template and weex-toolkit which has the tools to build the native app.

Create the app from this weex-vue template.

The template creates a project with the folder structure:

Your app will be in . If you open the file, you will find a simple layout with only two Weex components: and . You can find more about all the Weex components in the official docs. Weex compiles these components into html for the web version (e.g. an becomes an ) and into native components for the iOS/Android apps.

This example is very simple, but you can build more complex apps. Check out the weex-hackernews and weex-todo-list. These apps show how to use vue-router, vuex, locally persistent data, etc.

The command compiles the web and native versions of the app into . The starts a local webserver.

Now you can point your browser to to preview the mobile app in the browser, and to access the web version.

Firstly, we need to:

Then we add the android platform:

Then, connect an Android device (with USB debug activated) and run:

And that’s it! The app should be running in the device!

Add the dependencies from the pods:|||
