We’ve got roughly another week before Dodge reveals its hellish Challenger Demon, but Hennessey has already produced a rival. It’s called the Exorcist, and both the name and Hennessey’s press release make it clear the car is designed to be the anti-Demon. That may not come across visually, since on the surface it’s just a standard Camaro ZL1 with decals. But underneath is an LT4 V8 tuned to 1,000 horsepower and 966 lb-ft of torque.

To hit those lofty outputs, Hennessey ditched the standard supercharger for a bigger one and added an upgraded intercooler. The company also fitted a more aggressive camshaft, ported heads, long-tube headers, and tuned the ECU. Coupled with drag tires, Hennessey claims the Exorcist is good for a 0-60 mph time of under 3 seconds and a quarter-mile time of under 10 seconds. And Hennessey will sell you a set of drag radials to help you achieve those times, but like the rest of the package it’ll cost you.|||
