Reddit‘s UPVOTED.COM is a stand alone no-user interfered, no-comment, no-upvote new news website.

Surprisingly it is hosting on a wordpress VIP platform and it is a wordpress website.   Reddit could have used WordPress for the ease and no-frills.  Surely there must be many websites that have stand alone news with absolutely “zero” interaction from users.

So what makes UPVOTED.COM, so UPVOTED? Because its from Reddit.
