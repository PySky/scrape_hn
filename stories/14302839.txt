Requests to the Parser API are signed by your API key, sent in the headers of your request under the key x-api-key. Be careful not to reveal this token; requests directly to the Parser API should not be made on the client device but rather proxied to keep the API token secure.|||

With just one API request, Mercury takes any web article and returns only the relevant content — headline, author, body text, relevant images and more — free from any clutter. It’s reliable, easy-to-use and free.
