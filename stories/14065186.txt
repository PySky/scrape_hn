Keras (keras.is) implementation of Recurrent Weighted Average, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01253 . Follows original implementation in Tensorflow from https://github.com/jostmey/rwa . Works with fixed batch sizes, requires "batch_shape" parameter in input layer. Outputs proper config, should save and restore properly. You are welcomeâ€¦|||
