Also known as subcontracting, Staff Augmentation is primarily outsourcing of resources or manpower for limited period of time, on the basis of skill requirement or meeting aggressive project timelines.

Why is it important?

An efficient large-scale strategic saving can be made by an employer with temporary staffing. Staff augmentation helps in filling the gaps, particularly if any project needs an expertise. In difficult times, staff augmentation maintains the staffing in an effective and flexible way. It avoids cost of investing in development of internal skills. The staffing agencies will place resources on the basis of availability of manpower on contracts. This reduces the cost of benefits that are given to a permanent employment, such as sickness benefits, statutory benefits, holiday pay, insurance perks and other fringe benefits. Leveraging in the right skills for the right project seems like a smart idea.

Why should every organization have a Staff Augmentation Plan in place?

A Staff Augmentation Plan enables an agile IT organization that rapidly adapts to a changing environment in productive and cost-effective ways.



The absence of skilled resources, planned or unforeseen, can cause delays that cause productivity and financial losses. Worse, a loss of critical skills can leave a department unable to respond to problems that arise. The agility of your IT organization can impact your business outcomes. Senior, Human Resources, and IT Executives are increasingly recognizing the importance of implementing a Staff Augmentation Plan that enables a rapid response when needed. Theyâ€™re also recognizing that there are cost-effective ways to augment their internal resources with high value skills that can help take their IT departments to the next level.|||
