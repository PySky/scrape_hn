We have another PouchDB release. For a full changelog from 6.1.1 to 6.2.0, please see the releases page, I've summarised some of the new features and fixes below:

PouchDB-find is a new query language, this is based off CouchDB Mango. This work was originally started by Nolan Lawson and Garren Smith and has now been merged into the PouchDB monorepo.

Now that Pouchdb-find has been merged in, Will Holley updated replication and changes so that it is now possible to create a filtered replication using the PouchDB-find selectors and use it in the changes feed.

We are deprecating the api call in favour of a boolean flag. Read more about it here

As always, we welcome feedback from the community and would love to hear what you think of this release as well as PouchDB's future direction. Please don't hesitate to file issues or get in touch. And of course, a big thanks to all of our new and existing contributors!|||
