The vertebrate recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction can be approached through the ichnological record, which is much more abundant than body fossils. The late Olenekian (Early Triassic) tetrapod ichnoassemblage of the Catalan Pyrenean Basin is the most complete and diverse of this age from Western Tethys. This extensional basin, composed of several depocenters, was formed in the latest phases of the Variscan orogeny (Pangea breakup) and was infilled by braided and meandering fluvial systems of the red-beds Buntsandstein facies. Abundant and diverse tetrapod ichnites are recorded in these facies, including Prorotodactylus mesaxonichnus isp. nov. (tracks possibly produced by euparkeriids), cf. Rotodactylus, at least two large chirotheriid morphotypes (archosauriform trackmakers), Rhynchosauroides cf. schochardti, two other undetermined Rhynchosauroides forms, an undetermined Morphotype A (archosauromorph trackmakers) and two types of Characichnos isp. (swimming traces, here associated to archosauromorph trackmakers). The Pyrenean ichnoassemblage suggests a relatively homogeneous ichnofaunal composition through the late Early Triassic of Central Pangea, characterized by the presence of Prorotodactylus and Rotodactylus. Small archosauromorph tracks dominate and present a wide distribution through the different fluviatile facies of the Triassic Pyrenean Basin, with large archosaurian footprints being present in a lesser degree. Archosauromorphs radiated and diversified through the Triassic vertebrate recovery, which ultimately lead to the archosaur and dinosaur dominance of the Mesozoic.

The earliest Mesozoic fossil record represents the life recovery and ecosystems turnover [1] after the loss of most species during the end-Permian mass extinction [2]. The environmental and climatic conditions hindered recovery of life on land, delaying the recovery until the Middle Triassic [3, 4]. Concerning the vertebrate non-marine fauna, several lineage pulses took place during the Early Triassic [4], but the role of the main tetrapod groups in the recovery, as well as their paleogeographic and environmental distribution, are still a matter of discussion. The earliest Triassic non-marine tetrapod record (Induan to middle Olenekian) is only known from a few areas, such as the South-African Karoo Basin [5] and the Russian South Urals [1]. Most of the Early Triassic record is restricted to the late Olenekian, as occurs in the Western Tethys basins, mainly consisting of red-bed deposits of complex alluvial and aeolian continental systems [6–8]. The few Western Tethys vertebrate records, mostly footprints, are known from Morocco [9, 10], the Italian Southern Alps [11], southern Austria (the only known early Olenekian locality) [12], and the Catalan Pyrenees [8]. Further Lower Triassic records are found in the well-known archosaur-dominated tracksites from the Central European Germanic Basin [13–19], and in the Red Peak and Moenkopi formations of the USA [20–22]. In this contribution we present and discuss a diverse Triassic tetrapod ichnoassociation from the Catalan Pyrenees (NE Iberian Peninsula; Fig 1) framed in its stratigraphic and sedimentological setting. The reconstructed (ichno-) faunal assemblage and paleoenvironment (an archosauromorph-dominated fluvial setting) shed light on the paleobiogeography of the Early—Middle Triassic transition, as well as on the onset of continental vertebrate recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction.

In order to provide a detailed geographical and geological framework, we mapped three fossil-bearing localities based on field tracking of strata and photointerpretation (Fig 1). We logged (by means of a Jacobs staff and a centimeter) and correlated bed-by-bed a total of nine stratigraphic sections (numbered I to IX from West to East; Fig 2). The sedimentary facies and architectural elements (Figs 3 and 4) were classified following nomenclature of Miall [33, 34] and further compared with those of Gretter et al. [30]. Buntsandstein fluvial facies at the Erillcastell locality, including the Tossal de Pollerini tracksite. The dashed black square in the top picture corresponds to the detail of the fluvial systems in the bottom photo. Tetrapod tracks and trackways (some represented in plastic films) were measured on both specimens and photographs (using ImageJ v.148, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) following Haubold [35, 36], Leonardi [37] and Ptaszyński [13]. Ichnites were outlined in transparency films and finally digitized with a vector-based drawing software. 3D photogrammetric models of selected specimens were performed using photographs obtained with a digital compact camera Sony T-200 8.1 megapixel following the procedures of Mallison and Wings [38] and processed with three open access software following the procedures of Mujal et al. [8, 39]: Visual SFM (v.0.5.22, http://www.ccwu.me/vsfm/) to generate the point cloud, MeshLab (v.1.3.2, http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to perform and edit the mesh (texture, scale, orientation) and ParaView (v.4.1.0 http://www.paraview.org) to generate a color depth map and contour lines. High-resolution molds of tracks and trackways that could not be recovered were made with a two-component polyaddition silicone Harduplex® 23SH, acrylic resin (Acrystal Prima®) and glass-fiber. Once in the laboratory, a cast of each mold was produced with the same acryclic resin. Most of the studied specimens were found in situ and remained in the field, but those recovered and molds and casts are stored at the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont. Sedimentary facies and architectural elements codes are modified from Miall [33, 34] and Gretter et al. [30]. Conglomerate facies: Gh, Gmpt. Sandstone facies: St, Sp, Sr, Sh, Sl, Se.

The fossil-bearing unit corresponds to the redbed Buntsandstein facies, analyzed in three different areas, from W to E: Erillcastell (section I, of >151 m thick, including the Tossal de Pollerini tracksite, Erillcastell-Estac basin), Buira (section II, of >226 m, Erillcastell-Estac basin, at 8.32 km from Erillcastell) and Port del Cantó (sections III-IX, of 240 to 350 m, including the Rubió and Argestues tracksites, Cadí basin, at 27.52 km from Buira) (Figs 1 and 2). Three main units (sensu [28]) can be distinguished within the Buntsandstein sequences, from base to top: (a) conglomerate unit (oligomictic conglomerates of quartz pebbles and coarse sandstone with occasional breccia levels with lydite fragments), (b) shale and sandstones unit (reddish and greenish to greyish medium-coarse sandstones with some discontinuous conglomerate levels, reddish very fine to fine sandstones and reddish shales), and (c) shale unit (reddish shales with occasional thin but continuous sandstone beds as those of the shale and sandstones unit). It is worth noting that the thickness of each unit varies according to the basin configuration, and in some cases the conglomerate unit is even missing. We identified 13 lithofacies (Fig 3), grouped in seven facies associations and constituting architectural elements characteristic from channel to floodplain environments (Fig 4). The sedimentological interpretations are based on our field observations and follow those of Miall [33, 34] and Gretter et al. [30]. Two facies (Gh and Gmpt) are conglomeratic (commonly of quartz pebbles, and either massive or with cross stratification and other water flow structures), mainly located and well developed in the basal conglomerate unit and constituting deposits of braided systems, such as channels and longitudinal bars (architectural element CH1) and gravel bars (architectural element GB). Six sandstone facies are found (St, Sp, Sr, Sh, Sl and Se), with grain sizes ranging from very coarse to very fine, and a wide variety of internal stratifications and water flow structures. In the conglomerate unit, facies St and Sp are in association with facies Gh and Gmpt, constituting the architectural element CH1, and all the sandstone facies constitute channel fills and minor bars of braided systems (architectural element SB). In the shale and sandstones unit, and occasionally in the shale unit, sandstone facies occur as meandering systems elements, constituting sandy bedforms (e.g., crevasse splay deposits) associated to lateral accretions (architectural elements SB and LA, respectively). Facies St and Sp are also displayed as small channels (in association with facies Sr and occasionally Gh; architectural element CH2). The laminated sand sheets (architectural element LS), such as crevasse splays, of the shale and sandstones unit are mainly constituted by facies Sh and Sl. Scour fill deposits are mostly constituted by facies Se. Four facies are related to siltstones and claystones with occasional very fine sandstones (Fl, Fsc, Fm and Fr). They mainly constitute floodplain deposits (with common greenish reduction marks associated to plant roots) associated to the meandering systems, which occasionally underwent subaerial exposure (identified by the desiccation structures). These facies are commonly displayed as overbank fines (architectural element OF). In the shale and sandstones unit and in the shale unit, levels related to pedogenic processes (paleosols, facies P) were identified: (1) scarce thin levels of carbonate nodules and (2) hardened intervals of facies Fsc with hydromorphic marks (large green mottles), root traces and slickensides. A relevant association is the transition to the Muschelkalk facies. The facies Fsc of the shale unit are in transition to marls and fine laminated limestones corresponding to transitional/marine facies. At Port del Cantó, a thick sequence of dark red facies Fsc evolves to a laminated grey-greenish limestone/marl sequence. Although the top of the Buntsandstein sequence appears covered at Buira, the base of the Muschelkalk crops out and displays a breccia with Buntsandstein facies clasts embedded in a micritic limestone matrix. The detailed descriptions and interpretations of facies and architectural elements are provided in the supplemental information (S1 Text). In general terms, the Buntsandstein fluvial succession is displayed as a fining upwards sequence grading from coarse-grained braided to finer meandering and floodplain fluvial systems (high to low energy) and is arranged as a growth strata onlapping onto the Carboniferous-Permian sequences or the Variscan basement (Fig 2). The long laterally-extended meandering sand bodies are interbedded within floodplain mudstone intervals. Concerning the age of the Buntsandstein facies, Calvet et al. [40] provided palynological data from the shale unit, attributed to the early Anisian (early Middle Triassic). More recently, Mujal et al. [8] provided new palynological and ichnological data, giving an age of late Olenekian (late Early Triassic) for the lower-medium part of the shale and sandstones unit.

The Triassic Pyrenean Basin is a key region of Western Tethys to understand the early Mesozoic non-marine evolution in terms of paleoenvironment and (ichno-) faunal diversity. The red-bed Buntsandstein deposits of the Catalan Pyrenees correspond to a fluvial setting evolving from high-energy braided systems to low-energy meandering and floodplain systems that infilled the depocenters generated during the Triassic rifting. In our case, the Buntsandstein facies are arranged as a fining-upwards sequence culminated by the marine transgression of the Muschelkalk facies. A relatively diverse fossil record is yielded in the red-beds, and tetrapod footprints are especially abundant. We identified an ichnoassemblage composed by Prorotodactylus mesaxonichnus isp. nov., cf. Rotodactylus, at least two different chirotheriid morphotypes, Rhynchosauroides cf. schochardti and two other Rhynchosauroides forms, an undetermined Morphotype A, and two types of swimming scratches corresponding to Characichnos isp. The potential trackmakers of P. mesaxonichnus isp. nov. are archosauriform euparkeriids, suggesting, together with the other ichnotaxa, an ichnofaunal homogeneity at least along Central Pangea. Prorotodactylus and Rotodactylus may characterize the late Early Triassic continental deposits. The trackmakers of all these ichnotaxa probably correspond to archosauromorphs, suggesting that this group became dominant in the instable terrestrial settings after the end-Permian mass extinction. Archosauromorphs may represent the main pull of vertebrate recovery that lead to the further ecosystem stabilization of the Middle Triassic, with a turnover to larger archosaurian faunas and the radiation of this lineage.
