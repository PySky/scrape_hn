 Microsoft has been working with Qualcomm and Cavium to create a version of Windows that will run on ARM processors for use in the servers that power its' Azure Cloud service. VP of the Azure Cloud division Jason Zander said the company is "testing these chips for tasks like search, storage, machine learning and big data," but added that "It's not deployed into production yet, but that is the next logical step." The designs for the servers, known as Project Olympus, will be revealed at the Open Compute Project Summit and the Open Source nature of the design will allow other companies to utilize it in their own servers. While this is good news for Microsoft and for new technology, Intel could find itself in some trouble as the server market is currently its' most profitable segment.
