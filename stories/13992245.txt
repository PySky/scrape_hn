VCF East is for everyone! Computer geeks, families/children, students, collectors, IT professionals, curious onlookers…

Tickets: Click the link to buy tickets online (or get them at the door). Tickets are $20 for one day, $35 for two days, or $50 for three days.

Classes: Technical courses (and a movie!) dominate the first day of VCF East.

Exhibits (and exhibit registration): Hands-on exhibits are presented Saturday and Sunday. You’ll find demos of 1960s minicomputers, 1970s homebrew systems, 1980s eight-bitters, and a few oddities. Some exhibits contain pristine original machines, while others focus on unique modern hacks and everything in between.

Consignment: Vintage Computer Festivals are not flea/swap events, however we do offer a consignment room. Complete a form and we’ll try our best to sell your on-topic items. Our fee is 15% of final sales.

Vendors: Do you work for a business that may interest our audience? If so, then you may qualify for a professional vendor booth.

Food: Where there are computer nerds, there must be food! Items such as bagels, muffins, coffee, sandwiches, snacks, soft drinks, etc. will be available. Proceeds will benefit the InfoAge Science Center.

VCF East Dinner: There is a VIP dinner Saturday night. Exhibitors, volunteers, and speakers will have first access to tickets. We anticipate extra tickets being available to the public. An announcement will be made Saturday afternoon at the show.|||
