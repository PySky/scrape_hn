It’s not the first time that the relevance of UK university courses has been called into question – but it’s usually employers who have complained. Even in the mid 1990s, companies like Intel were saying the graduates produced by UK universities didn’t have the skills or level of knowledge they were looking for.

But it’s one of the first times that a survey has found graduates complaining about the quality of education. Perhaps this has something to do with the high levels of debt being racked up; graduates expect the money they invest in themselves is going to be well spent.

At the heart of the problem is the fact that industry’s needs develop more quickly than academia can respond. And that isn’t a problem that can be easily solved.|||

Research commissioned by Intern Tech among 2000 UK adults claims the UK’s university system is failing both students and businesses. According to the survey, 41% of graduates have had to take an entry-level job below graduate level once they left university, while 26% of those surveyed regret the time and money they spent on their university education. Meanwhile, 28% of respondents said their degree courses were ‘outdated’ in relation to current requirements.
