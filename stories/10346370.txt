# Native Netflix video streaming has come to GnuLinux! ...if you have the correct library versions.



I am currently running GNU-Linux Debian 7 - Wheezy with OpenBox.  I really enjoy this lightweight, speedy and easily customized window manager (OpenBox uses simple XML configuration files). So I was also pretty excited when Netflix added HTML5 streaming support and read that folks were proclaiming success in Google Chrome browsers without necessitating any agent masking workarounds.



However, I found I was still getting errors when attempting to stream video in Chrome. The forums I was reading were reporting that when using the Chrome 36+ browser, Netflix would allow Linux streaming. Most all of these forums were based in a Ubuntu 14.04+ environment. Nevertheless, I found a hint as to how to proceed in Debian after reading this article regarding libnss:



Debian Wheezy's repo list maxed out at libnss3==2:3.14 and I would need libnss3==2:3.16+ in order to pass the DRM tests and securely stream with Netflix's HTML5 option enabled. In order to allow this libnss upgrade, I would first need to provide APT with instructions to pull from the Debian "jessie" development branch.



This is accomplished by setting repo priorities. I created a "jessie" specific APT sources list and added the Debian repo url's for jessie:



And set pin priorities for libnss3 to fetch jessie libraries over wheezy - while defining a lower priority of all other jessie packages:



Restart any Chrome instances (and upgrade to 36+ if you haven't yet) and enjoy Netflix streaming on Debian Linux!
