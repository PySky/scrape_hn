Tick Tock Unlock brings you the UKâ€™s first Hyper Reality Experience, merging virtual reality technology with physical sets and stage effects to create an incredibly immersive and unique experience. The hyper reality experience is a new type of entertainment and new way to explore different realities; it works by combining real-world physicality with video games, movies and stories. The hyper reality experience is suitable for anybody with a sense of adventure. It will be coming to the Leeds International Festival as a public installation at Trinity Leeds.|||
