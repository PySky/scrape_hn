At about noon on Thursday, I lowered a headset over my eyes and, for the first time in my life, stepped into Microsoft Windows.

I was invited to attend an Acer event in New York where the company primarily discussed its VR and gaming ambitions. But I had one mission: to finally see what Microsoft's "mixed reality" experience is all about.

Today I lowered a headset over my face and stepped into a virtual version of Windows while testing a new Microsoft mixed reality headset developed by Acer.
