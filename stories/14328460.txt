What does the directory structure look like? Are all components dumped into './components'? Or are they broken up by feature/module? By Page?

I'm involved wit a large react-redux (etc.) project at work, and it seems to grow daily with features. It's been an ongoing struggle to have to think about maintaining a consistent structure, especially since there are only conventions rather than protocols. We have recently adjusted to a page based directory structure, where a page directory has both a container and component subdirectory. This works, but it seems strange to have a top level components directory (see below) AND a page specific component directory.

How do you manage a large project directory structure/code structure with many many components? I'm not concerned about containers, rather how do you manage stateless/functional/dumb/presentational components when your numbers start hitting 50, 100, 1000 +.|||
