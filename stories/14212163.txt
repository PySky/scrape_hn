Keras is an easy-to-use and powerful library for Theano and TensorFlow that provides a high-level neural networks API to develop and evaluate deep learning models.

We recently launched one of the first online interactive deep learning course using Keras 2.0, called “Deep Learning in Python.

Now, DataCamp has created a Keras cheat sheet for those who have already taken the course and that still want a handy one-page reference or for those who need an extra push to get started.

In short, you’ll see that this cheat sheet not only presents you with the six steps that you can go through to make neural networks in Python with the Keras library.|||
