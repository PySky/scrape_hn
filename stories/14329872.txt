Our wood-fired Gaucho Grill brings more flavor and more possibilities to your grilling experience. The 30-inch spoked wheel allows you to effortlessly raise and lower the grill grates, giving you total control over the intensity of the heat. This technique is ideal for cooking thick, bone-in ribeye steaks. You can bring the steaks closer to the flames to build up a flavorful crust, then move them further away to let them slowly cook to your ideal doneness.



Watch this video to see how Kalamazoo grillmaster Russ Faulk cooks the perfect ribeye steak. He’ll walk you through the process of building the cooking fire and mastering the use of the Gaucho Grill’s spoked wheel. You’ll also learn how to score the meat to maximize the Maillard reaction, create a basting glaze that deepens the flavor, and cook steaks to the perfect temperature every time using a Steakchamp Thermometer.
