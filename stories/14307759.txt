NEW DELHI: Japan’s SoftBank Group — the biggest investor in troubled Indian online marketplace Snapdeal — said it has incurred a loss of over Rs 9,000 crore (160.42 billion yen or $1.41 billion) from its investments in the country’s Internet commerce sector.The Masayoshi Son-led telecom and media conglomerate on Wednesday attributed a large part of the overall loss to its investments in Snapdeal, besides ride-hailing app Ola The disclosure — a part of its full-year results — comes even as SoftBank is negotiating the sale of Snapdeal to bigger rival Flipkart and seeking separate buyers for its payments arm FreeCharge.Market share positions of both Snapdeal and FreeCharge have suffered over the past few months as the company has initiated cost cuts and layoffs. The Gurgaon-based company, valued at a high of $6.5 billion in February last year, is estimated to be seeking a sale price of about $1billion.“(The) highly competitive ecommerce market in India has made a trend of the company’s business performance lower than initially anticipated,” SoftBank said in an official statement.The special loss of 114.059 billion yen, or about $1 billion, represented impairments on its investments in subsidiaries and associates, including Starfish I Pte Ltd , through which it owns 33% in Snapdeal, the Tokyo-headquartered group said.Starfish I, an intermediate holding company, owns preferred shares in Jasper Infotech, which owns and operates Snapdeal.Snapdeal’s weaker performance had led to “a material decrease in net asset value of Starfish I Pte Ltd as of March 31, 2017, and therefore SBG impaired the carrying amount of its shares in the company, to the amount equivalent to its net asset value”, the statement said.Ola suffered a drop in valuation last year from the peak of $5 billion in November 2015 to $3 billion late last year, when it raised $250 million from SoftBank. But since then the Bengaluru-based startup, which competes with Uber, has managed to raise capital from Ratan Tata’s RNT Capital and New York-based hedge fund Falcon Edge at a higher valuation.SoftBank is one of the biggest investors in India’s digital commerce market, having sunk in nearly $2 billion across companies such as Snapdeal — in which it has invested $900 million — as well as Ola, grocery delivery app Grofers and hotel room aggregator Oyo.In recent times, the $16-billion Indian online retail industry has been beset by slow growth and increased competition led by America’s Amazon and China’s Alibaba, which has taken a controlling stake in Paytm Mall. While market leader Flipkart has withstood the challenge, Snapdeal has failed to maintain growth and control costs slipping to fifth position in terms of sales volume, according to industry estimates.In its regulatory disclosure, Soft-Bank said the changes in the fair value of Jasper Infotech have been recorded on a quarterly basis as gain or loss on financial instruments.This has been recognised at fair value through profit or loss on the income statements.“The valuation of our financial investments are frequently adjusted upwards or downwards due to accounting policies, currency fluctuations and market dynamics.The loss reported in today’s earnings represents the aggregate impact of such revaluations during the course of the entire fiscal year,” a SoftBank spokesperson said.The statement comes on the day the Japanese company reported full-year net income, which at 1.43 trillion yen for the 12 months ended March 31topped analyst estimates. This was driven primarily by cost cuts and an improved performance by its US-based wireless business Sprint Corp.In February, SoftBank had recorded a $350-million loss on its investments in Snapdeal and Ola.Earlier, in November 2016, it said it had recorded a loss of over $550 million for the six-month period ending September 30, primarily driven by preferred stock held by it in both the companies.|||

SoftBank is the largest private investor in India's startup ecosystem. The Masayoshi Son-led giant has pumped in over $2 billion here till date.
