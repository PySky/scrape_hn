It was a leap of faith when I decided to start storytelling with data® back in 2010. While I knew there was an opportunity to help people by sharing what I’ve learned over the years, I could not have predicted the enthusiasm and excitement that would build with my workshops, speaking engagements, and book. I tweet it often: #ilovemyjob and how I’m able to help individuals have greater impact in their jobs and organizations grow their business.

Recently, we discovered that there is an ambitious effort and market around selling fake or bootlegged versions of my book, storytelling with data. After my initial reaction—“That’s insane! There is a black market for my book?!?”—I shifted to the more practical and disappointing flurry of topics to consider including: trademark and copyright infringement, lost revenue, individuals profiting off of other people’s work, and so forth. Most disturbing to me, however, is the lower quality of these knock off books.

I care deeply about quality, attention to detail, and the overall audience experience. It’s why I try to pick cool places and venues for my workshops, chose to partner with my publisher, Wiley, and read through and edit blog posts like this about a zillion times prior to posting. This focus on quality removes distractions from my message. Unfortunately, the fake copies are leading to a poor experience of storytelling with data. I was always confused by negative feedback on the quality of the book—it’s become clear now that this is due to bootlegged copies, which, sadly, have been out there since the book's launch. Here are some images illustrating the issues:|||
