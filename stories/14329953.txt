 statsd-vis supports counters, timers, gauges and sets. For timers, it computes the mean, lower bound, upper bound, count and percentile thresholds. It also supports sample rates and sub-millisecond values for timers.

You can tweak the StatsD flush interval, the percentiles and other parameters from the command line.

Dashboards can be created by editing the URL directly. You can specify multiple series in a graph and multiple graphs in a dashboard with a simple syntax. See this demo URL to see how it works.

statsd-vis is open source (MIT licensed), lives on github and is written in Go, with no compile-time dependencies. To build it, "go get" it:

You can find pre-built binaries for release on the github releases page. You can compile it for other platforms like Raspberry Pi (Linux on ARM) for example:

Feel free to play with the software, and send us pull requests and bug reports to keep the party going! Cheers from RapidLoop!|||
