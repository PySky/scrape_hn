Taughtful is currently in beta and is a social experiment which is free to participate in with the primary goal of disrupting the public education system. We want to see if people can help others learn by the proliferation and sharing of knowledge within the global community. We will work to continually expand the platform, based on user feedback; to enable people to learn the skills they need to achieve both their educational and career goals, without the need for a formal education. Taughtful is an excellent tool to supplement your existing knowledge and show off your current expertise.|||

A crowd-sourced skills testing platform that lets you create and take tests for virtually any skill. Tests get smarter over time. Use your test results to show off, learn or to land your dream job.
