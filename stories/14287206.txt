In my experience, it is not enough to know one manufacturer. You may need more. Nor it is enough to know only VHDL. You'd better know also Verilog. And even start thinking to learn other resources and tools, like HLS.So, now that I have finished (more or less) for publishing this link, here it is The short, 32 page guide includes the following subjects:|||
