An Introduction to Programming in Go As the title suggests, this is a short, concise introduction to computer programming using the language Go. Getting Started – covers files and folders, the terminal, text editors, and Go tools Your First Program – the obligatory “Hello World” Variables – covers how to name a variable, scope, constants, defining multiple variables, and closing with an example program Control Structures – start to write useful programs by learning about control structures: for, if, and switch Arrays, Slices and Maps – looks at three more built-in types: arrays, slices and maps Functions – an independent section of code that maps zero or more input parameters to zero or more output parameters Pointers – examines the * and & operators, and new Structs and Interfaces – a struct is a type which contains named fields. For interfaces, the chapter explains the “method set” Concurrency – Go has rich support for concurrency using goroutines and channels The Core Packages – takes a look at some of the most commonly used packages included with Go The online version of the book is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License. There is an updated version of the book available to purchase.

Go Bootcamp – Everything you need to know to get started with Go teachers the reader, among other things, the pros and cons of static typing, what makes the language unique, what Go is good at, and what are the challenging aspects of the language. The book offers exercises to help cement the knowledge learned. The Basics – looks at variables and inferred typing, constants, printing constants and variables, packages and imports, code location, exported names, and more Types – includes structs, initializing, composition vs inheritance and more Control flow – if statement, for loop, and switch case statement are covered Methods – types and methods allow for an object-oriented style of programming Interfaces – an interface type is defined by a set of methods. A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods Concurrency – explores one of the most interesting aspects of the Go language Tips and Tricks – shares some tricks experienced developers discovered over time The book is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License and code licensed under a BSD license.

Building Web Apps with Go covers a wide array of web topics. The net/http package – starts with a brief overview of HTTP before moving on to explore an important package, net/http Middleware – shows how to use a Negroni stack with the built in middleware and how to create your own custom middleware Rendering – learn how render HTML and JSON using the methods offered in Go’s standard library Testing – covers the unit-test style approach and an end-to-end approach Controllers – illustrates the benefits in using a controller model This book is licensed under the CC BY-SA 3.0 License, the code is licensed under a BSD 3-Clause License, unless otherwise specified. There are portions of this book that are incomplete.

This book describes how to develop web application in Go, introducing a lot of basic knowledge, development tools and techniques. The book uses this knowledge to implement a simple web framework. Web foundation – talks about some concepts of the web and how to run web applications in Go HTTP Form – how to handle form data in Go, and how to validate form data Database – examines the database driver interface design in Go, before moving on to introducing SQM database drivers Go, and then presenting the ORM Data Storage and session – highlights the differences between cookies and sessions, session hijacking, and how to prevent it Text files – XML, JSON, regular expressions, the MVC pattern to develop applications in Go, ending with an introduction to file and folder operations Security and encryption – CSRF attacks, filter inputs, XSS attacks, SQL injection, password storage, and encrypting and decrypting data Error handling, debugging and testing – describes how to handle errors in the Go language and how to design your own handling package and functions, how to use GDB to debug programs under dynamic operating conditions. The chapter moves on to explaining unit testing and in-depth discussions and examples on how to write unit tests Deployment and maintenance – logs, errors and crashes, deployment, and backup and recovery Build a web framework – introduces the MVC architecture, a routing and logging system and simple server configuration This book is licensed under the CC BY-SA 3.0 License, the code is licensed under a BSD 3-Clause License, unless otherwise specified.

This book is aimed at developers with some knowledge of programming languages and how to program. Introduction – details the lineage of the language and shows the types, variables and control structures Functions – how to make and use functions Packages – functions and data are grouped together in packages. Here you’ll see how to make your own package. How to unit test your package is also described Beyond the basics – learn how to create your own data types and define functions on them (called methods) Interfaces – Go does not support Object Orientation in the traditional sense. In Go the central concept is interfaces Concurrency – with the go keyword functions can be started in separate routines (called goroutines). Communication with these goroutines is done via channels Communication – how to create/read/write from and to files. And how to do networking This work is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

This book teaches you how to write web applications in Go without using a framework. Each new concept is explained with a valid code example. Using databases in Go The book is released under an open source license.

The Little Go Book The Little Go Book is an introduction to Google’s Go programming language. It’s aimed at developers who aren’t that comfortable with the idea of pointers and static typing. The Little Go Book is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.

Let’s learn Go is an online resource which aims to introduce people to Go, and have some fun at the same time. Learn the very basic things about Go. This includes the basic syntax for programs, how to declare variables, pointers, and how to use basic control structure. The online book then moves on to teaching the reader how to use primitive data types and basic control structures to build composite types and functions. The book later delves deeper into functions and solving real world problems. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.|||

Go is a compiled, statically typed programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. It's a general purpose programming language with modern features, clean syntax and a robust well-documented common library, making it a good candidate to learn as your first programming language. While it borrows ideas from other languages…
