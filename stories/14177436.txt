Although I am not the biggest fan of strictly tracking analytic on the blog and on social media, time to time I like to track it. And for everyone that prefer digital over paper template I have prepared Google Sheets to track your blog and social media stats.

  

 It consists of two tabs. On the first, you can find an overview and on second all detailed stats. On first tab you don’t have to change anything, this works automatically. On second tab you should add date and stats in every column.

Immediately after you add a new row with new stats on the second tab, the first tab will be automatically updated. On the Overview tab, you can then first see the comparison between the last and the new track, where you can quickly see how much followers you have gained or lose (those are specially marked).
