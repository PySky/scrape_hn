Welcome to the home page for the 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know project, pearls of wisdom for programmers collected from leading practitioners. You can read through the Contributions Appearing in the Book plus the Other Edited Contributions, browse Contributions in Progress, view the list of Contributors, and also learn How to Become a Contributor. If you would simply like to comment on a contribution, please also read How to Become a Contributor as some of it applies to you.

There is no overarching narrative: The collection is intended simply to contain multiple and varied perspectives on what it is that contributors to the project feel programmers should know. This can be anything from code-focused advice to culture, from algorithm usage to agile thinking, from implementation know-how to professionalism, from style to substance, etc.

The deadline for having something considered for inclusion in the the book form of the project has passed, but the site is still open for contributions. 97 contributions have been selected and the book has now been published in O'Reilly's 97 Things series. The series already includes 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know and 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know. You can find out more about the series and the 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know project in this InfoQ article.
