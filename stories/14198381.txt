Programming today is becoming mandatory, even in the primary school kids are learning to program basic stuff. It is always good to know which programming languages are used for which type of applications. In this article we will review 5 most popular programming languages today.

Java is one of the most popular programming languages today and it is used on more than 8 billion devices worldwide. Java is object-oriented programming language, and become very popular because it is easier than C or C++ and programmers get used to it very fast. For example if you had worked in the university in C or C++ then Java will be very easy to learn. Java is developed by James_Gosling

C++ is increment of C language, as the name is from increasing variable in C language. C++ is created by Bjarne Stroustrup

Object-oriented programming language which was revolution in 90 â€˜s. Allows the programmer to be more expressive and still keep the performances good. I doubt you havenâ€™t used any of software written in C++.

Here is a list of popular software applications writeen in C++

Javascript is the soul of the web which gives life to HTML and CSS. Everything interactive on the web is javascript. It is integrated in every browser today and you can do very interesting things with it.

PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and itâ€™s an HTML-embedded scripting language. Its syntax is derived from C, Java and Perl but it also has unique features that makes this language one of the most widely used computer languages in the World Wide Web.

The main use of PHP is to allow developers to create dynamical web pages. The language has suffered many transformations along the road and has a very active community. There are various important PHP frameworks that are being used by important companies in the industry.

Thanks to its functionality, PHP can easily communicate with databases and exchange data that other languages are hardly able to do so.

Famous applications that are using PHP:

class mergeSort { /** * splitting the array recursively until has max two elements * merging and sorting recursively until sorted array is built * * @param type $array * @return array Sorted input array */ public function sort($array) { //if array has 1 element return that element $count=count($array); if ($count<=1) return $array; //split array and build left and right arrays $mid=(int)$count/2; $left=array(); $right=array(); for ($i=0;$i<$mid;$i++) { $left[]=$array[$i]; } for ($i=$mid;$imerge($this->sort($left),$this->sort($right)); } /** * merge left and right arrays sorting elements * * @param array $left * @param array $right * @return array */ private function merge($left,$right) { $sorted=array(); //compare first element from left with first element from right //add the lowest to $sorted and erase it from parent array while (count($left)>0 && count($right)>0) if ($left[0]<$right[0]) { $sorted[]=$left[0]; array_shift($left); } else { $sorted[]=$right[0]; array_shift($right); } //after one of right and left arrays is empty is added elements from //remaining to $sorted for ($i=0;$i<count($left);$i++) $sorted[]=$left[$i]; for ($i=0;$i<count($right);$i++) $sorted[]=$right[$i]; return $sorted; } } Â Â Â Â  * splitting the array recursively until has max two elements Â Â Â Â  * merging and sorting recursively until sorted array is built //if array has 1 element return that element //split array and build left and right arrays //compare first element from left with first element from right //add the lowest to $sorted and erase it from parent array //after one of right and left arrays is empty is added elements from

Python is a high-level, general purpose programming language. Pythonâ€™s simple and easy to learn syntax eases the readability therefore decreasing the costs of program maintenance. Like other modern programming languages, it supports modules and packages that are developed by the fast-growing and dedicated community.

Moreover, debugging a Python program is nowhere near a hassle, since there is no compilation step and the edit-test-debug cycle is pretty fast. And fortunately for everybody, Python has a rich and easy to read documentation, where you can also learn how to properly debug a program.

It surely excels at integration tasks. Due to its versatility and ready-made tools, many developers use Python as an embedded scripting language.

It is also very popular in the web environment as it is a solid backbone for back-end development.

Another use of Python, which I think you might find it cool is programming robots, drones, science projects and house automation systems.
