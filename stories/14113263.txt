To some people these two concepts might be mutually exclusive, as at the end of 4 years of school, with a degree in one hand you (probably) won’t also be holding a stock of knowledge and/or enough practice to be able to call yourself a *insert programming language name here* developer.

Whether or not a formal education and a university degree is useful or not remains something to be debated, but I want to make a point in this article about how a college education introduces you to certain programming languages. Universities have their appeal, they bring structure and beyond the curriculum and information shared, they also have people, the community that can help you grow and achieve more than learning on your own.

Eric Elliott said in an article last year that:

“Engineering is about applications, not theory. Most universities teach a variety of well-known cookie-cutter algorithms, many of which are not commonly used in modern programming languages because better alternatives are built into the language or standard libraries.”

His bottom line was, if you want to be an entrepreneur and build the next awesome product/company out there and you enjoy math and science, then a degree might be worthwhile, but if you want to build awesome apps (be a developer) it’s not necessary.

That being said, most developers, at least those who took the Stack Overflow 2017 survey would agree with him, as 90% of them consider themselves self taught and 32% consider their formal education (they do have one) not very important to their success.

But here’s the other side of the coin, 49% percent of computer science major and computer engineering majors consider their formal education important or very important. Truth be told the degree you get when you graduate is just a small piece of the puzzle, there’s plenty more to learn afterwards, but it is a very good foundation.|||
