NoSQL database supplier Basho is looking for a sale.

Basho Technologies provides the Riak KV (key:value) and TS (Time Series) databases to store massive data lakes. It's recently had a focus on the Internet of Things and processing at the edge.

We have been hearing that the company has fallen on hard times. It last issued a press release in September 2016. PR agencies BOCA Communications in the USA and Axicom in the UK were dispensed with earlier this year.

Stephen Condon, its senior director of marketing, joined Hive Streaming in April.

Basho has had an eventful life. Here's a timeline:

Total funding is $66m and, three years after his appointment, CEO and president Adam Wray's time appears to be coming to a close; the IoT data boom being slow to arrive.

A source close to Basho tells us it is currently working on a sale process. Good luck. Â®|||
