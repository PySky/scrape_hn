Does anyone make better cookies, pastries and desserts overall than the Italians? We don't think so! And bread? Please.

But here's the problem: Walk into a well-stocked Italian bakery and you're confronted with dozens of different cookies and pastries, many that look alike, many with unpronounceable names. Sfingi, sflogliatelle. Pannetone, panna cotta and panforte. Even Italians, myself included, can get dazed and confused inside your typical Italian bakery.

So with Easter upon us, we've put together the ultimate explainer guide to Italian cookies, pastries and desserts. Confused about the difference between biscotti and cantucci? Curious to know what restaurant puts 13 kinds of Swiss chocolate in its tartufo? Wonder no more. And don't forget to keep this list handy — these treats are terrific year-round! (Note: the spellings of many of these items differ depending on which region of Italy they're found in.)|||
