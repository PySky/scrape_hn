Okay, ladies, let's get in formation and start filling out scholarship applications. Beyoncé announced a new scholarship fund this morning on her website, writing that the scholarships are meant "to encourage and support young women who are unafraid to think outside the box and are bold, creative, conscious and confident."

It's unclear if the scholarship is a full ride or just a partial grant. But then the ability to tell everyone that Beyoncé is putting you through school is priceless.|||
