HIMALAYAL - SHANGHAI - CHINA



The first home-made UHV converter transformer with largest capacity and highest primary voltage developed by China XD Group Cooperation for Ximeng-Taizhou ±800kV UHVDC project passed the delivery test successfully on Feb 25, 2017. The successful development of product marks a major change in the UHVDC field and consolidates the lead of technology and capability of home-made high-end electric equipment production in the UHVDC sector.



The China XD Group Cooperation obtained the order from SGCC at the end of 2015, that is, the purchase of 28 UHV converter transformers of “two DC” projects - ±800kV Shanghai Miao - Shandong and Ximeng-Taizhou. Compared with previous UHVDC projects, “two DC” projects firstly increased ±800kV DC transmission capacity from 8 million kilowatt to 10 billion kilowatt and primary voltage from 750kV to 1000kV. To ensure the quality and progress of UHV product production, China XD Group dispatched more than 70 technical and production professionals to station in the Changzhou production base, where they still worked during the Spring Festival. Relying on many years of experience and innovation, the transformer passed all tests one-time through their careful and delicate work and insisting on high standards for all production links.  



 



The converter transformer supplies the AC voltage into two separate circuits feeding the rectifier bridges with a phase shift of 30 electrical degrees. Also as a galvanic barrier between AC and DC systems, it prevents DC potential from entering the AC system.|||
