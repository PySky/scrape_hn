Have you ever heard about unidirectional data flow? Flux and/or Redux?

In this talk, we will talk about how to follow the principles that architectures like Flux and Redux do on the web, but on Android.

What is a state? A dispatcher? Middleware? Controller view? How do we glue all these parts together? How to keep our domain isolated from the outer world so is easily testable?

We will cover all these topics and much more!!, and you know what? everything with a bit of Kotlin sauce, so we will see how we can take advantage of the cool stuff this language provide us to make our architecture even better.|||
