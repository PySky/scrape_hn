We are excited to announce the general availability of our new product: Docker private registry to store securely your Docker images.

Our easy to use web interface allows you to browse and inspect your images. Share your images with other Pikacloud users and work as a team!

We connect a vulnerability scanner to your registry and notify you if something goes wrong with your Docker builds.

Billing is done on a monthly basis calculated on your Docker images storage usage. We apply a 95th percentile discount to smooth short-lived storage peak usage. €0.10 per GB. Unlimited private registries and team members included. No network transfer fee or quota.

We will release very soon new features in the API to connect your registry with external services thought triggers and notifications. Stay tuned, devops!

Feel free to suggest features, ask for regional availability or if you require on-premise needs. Contact us at support@pikacloud.com

This is part of our effort to create services for developers and ops people to easily build and run applications from development to production, as a service.|||
