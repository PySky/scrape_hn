Tired of waiting for your Android builds to finish? Well, the wait is over…

JRebel for Android picks up changes to your application and skips building a new APK for each change. Code and resource changes are transferred in incremental packages. Saving you time and effort every day!

Losing application state is one of the biggest time sinks when testing code changes. JRebel for Android recreates the top-most activity. This gets rid of the pain having to re-navigate through the application to reproduce the desired state.

No project code modification required. JRebel for Android works out-of-the box with Android Studio, Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA — as well as emulators and devices. Simply install the IDE plugin from Jetbrains repositories and start using. There is no learning curve, it just works!|||

Develop your Android apps in real time. The changes you make are automatically applied to your running application. Works with real devices and emulators alike.
