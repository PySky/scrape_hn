At Open Collective, we’ve got front row seats for observing how open source communities handle finances, and we’ve learned a lot about what works. But surprisingly, we also see some money just sitting there untouched.

It’s time to get your money moving! Whether you’ve got $50 or $5000 to burn, read on for great ideas.

Pro tip: Through your Open Collective, you can pay out not only for expense reimbursements but also for invoices, which makes it a lot easier to fund people’s time.

Meeting in person can really elevate your community to the next level. You can have rich discussions, build relationships, and put faces to the online names. Community makes a huge difference in engagement and excitement.

People who donate want the open source ecosystem to thrive. If you win, they win. The same applies to you as well, so pay it forward!|||
