Onyx Typewriter has up to 25 days battery life in use (up to 50+ days battery life in standby according to Onyx), it is the world's first E Ink Laptop. The screen can be perfect to type texts outdoors, during the day in the sunlight, in the park, on your boat, on your balcony, on the beach, to get some natural sunlight while doing work! Of course the E Ink Laptop cannot replace your existing laptop, this is why a smart UI is going to be required. Onyx Typewriter runs Android so a smart app/instance could potentially make this great.

Onyx 10.3" BOOX Buddy from Onyx (at 7min27sec in this video) is one of the most amazing E Ink devices that I have even seen, amazingly light, thin, the E Ink display is flexible! Flush with the bezels, has a digitizer annotations support and capacitive touch, extremely beautiful and check how quick the stylus input is, it feels nearly like writing with a pen on paper!

These new awesome Onyx devices are two of the coolest new devices in the world. Here are just two, but there is more (check my other Onyx video featuring Onyx BOOX Max Carta 13.3" 2200x1650 Flexible E Ink device here) could enter mass production and be released in the months to come, when they can be perfected for release. Hopefully the price for these will be affordable, that might depend on the popularity and demand for these special E Ink displays, as the highest cost of these devices is the E Ink display and E Ink prices their displays cheaply only if the volumes are going to be big enough.|||
