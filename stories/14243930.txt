There was an old man who said, “Do

 Tell me how I’m to add two and two!

 I’m not very sure

 That it does not make four,

 But I fear that is almost too few.”

A mathematician confided

 A Möbius strip is one-sided.

 You’ll get quite a laugh

 If you cut one in half,

 For it stays in one piece when divided.

A mathematician named Ben

 Could only count modulo ten.

 He said, “When I go

 Past my last little toe,

 I have to start over again.”

‘Tis a favorite project of mine

 A new value of π to assign.

 I would fix it at 3,

 For it’s simpler, you see,

 Than 3.14159.

J.A. Lindon points out that 1264853971.2758463 is a limerick:

One thousand two hundred and sixty

 four million eight hundred and fifty

 three thousand nine hun-

 dred and seventy one

 point two seven five eight four six three.

From Dave Morice, in the November 2004 Word Ways:

A one and a one and a one

 And a one and a one and a one

 And a one and a one

 And a one and a one

 Equal ten. That’s how adding is done.

Two classics, one from Leigh Mercer:

A dozen, a gross, and a score

 Plus three times the square root of four

 Divided by seven

 Plus five times eleven

 Is nine squared and not a bit more.

The integral z-squared dz

 From one to the cube root of three

 Times the cosine

 Of three pi over nine

 Equals log of the cube root of e.

UPDATE: Reader Jochen Voss found this on a blackboard at Warwick University:

If M’s a complete metric space

 (and non-empty), it’s always the case:

 If f’s a contraction

 Then, under its action,

 Exactly one point stays in place.

And Trevor Hawkes sent this:

A mathematician called Klein

 Thought the Möbius strip was divine.

 He said if you glue

 The edges of two

 You get a nice bottle like mine.|||
