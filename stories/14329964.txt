Today I’ve got some good news for AmigaOS 4 owners. A driver for Google Cloud Print has been released! It was developed by Chris Young and can be downloaded directly from Aminet, so please click here to grab it. I noticed the news while browsing Amiga.org this morning.

Google Cloud Print allows printing to any printer, no matter where it

 is located. This is achieved by connecting the printer to a Google

 account, from where it can be shared with other accounts. Connecting

 a printer to Google Cloud Print requires running some “connector”

 software on the computer hosting the printer. For Windows and OS X,

 this can be Google Chrome, although a standalone connector is also

 available and additionally works on Linux. Some new printers have

 native support for Google Cloud Print and do not need a separate

 connector.

gcp.device enables the Amiga to print directly to any of these cloud-

 connected printers, using the PostScript printer driver (Google’s

 preferred format is PDF, but we don’t have a PDF printer driver yet).

The only requirement is that the printer is connected to or shared

 with the Google account you authenticate gcp.device with.|||
