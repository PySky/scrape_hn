My main focus has switched to reimplement this project in Rust as it allows me to realize my vision of a secure password manager which is not possible with Python. However I will publish bug fixes and answer bug reports if there are any. As KeePassC is stable and feature-complete this shouldn't be a reason for not using it anymore.

KeePassC is a password manager fully compatible to KeePass v.1.x and KeePassX. That is, your password database is fully encrypted with AES.

KeePassC is written in Python 3 and comes with a curses-interface. It is completely controlled with the keyboard (vim-like keys are supported).

An introduction can be found here.

An introduction for network use can be found here.

If all dependencies are fulfilled type 'python setup.py install' in the root directory of KeePassC.

There are packages in the ArchLinux User Repository:

Start the program with 'keepassc'. To get help type 'F1' while KeePassC is executed and you will see usage information to the current window (not in main menu).

A small commandline interface is available, too. Type 'keepassc -h'.
