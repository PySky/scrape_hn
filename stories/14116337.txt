NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson knows social media trolls are everywhere and can’t always be avoided. But he also knows the perfect way to handle them — he fires a shot right back.

He’s never mean or malicious, but Johnson lets his sassier side come out to handle the hate. Being a seven-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion helps back that up too.

Like many NASCAR drivers, Johnson is very social and uses the platforms to connect with fans. He told NASCAR reporter Jeff Gluck that Instagram is his favorite platform — followed by Strava, a workout tracker, because of course it is — Johnson said he uses Twitter to get his news and checks it multiple times a day.

But Johnson’s not afraid of critics hiding behind social media, saying: “I haven’t blocked a single person yet on any platform. Believe me, I’ve wanted to.”

He explained he “couldn’t believe” some of the things people would say about him and his wife, Chandra, and it kept him from joining the Twitter world for a while.

“But then I realized the importance of it, so you just need to breeze by certain things and move on. But poking fun back at these guys is, I think, critical. You know, people sitting in their underwear in their mom’s basement, they’re pretty brave and want to say things. It’s funny — as soon as you draw attention to them and let some hating happen on their feed, they’re quickly apologizing, they delete the tweet and hopefully they don’t do it to anyone else again.”

The Hendrick Motorsports driver has a lot of fans who will fire their own two cents back at the trolls, and they’re not always as friendly about it as Johnson.

His advice to critics? “Be a little smarter before you hit send.”|||
