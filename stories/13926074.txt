The government's quietly announced ban on electronic carry-ons from certain foreign airports on certain airlines could have a harsh impact on three airlines that have ramped up their operations at Logan Airport in recent years, because the ban could cause business travelers, who pay more for the ability to work in flight, to seek other ways to the US.

The ban covers flights on Emirates Airlines, which started flying to and from Logan in 2014 and Qatar Airways, which began flying to and from Logan in 2016.

A third airline, Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi, shares booking with JetBlue, which has turned Logan into one of its US hubs. Matthew George writes:
