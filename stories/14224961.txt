Flying soldiers have been historically confined to science fiction or comic books, but a British inventor may be about to change the course of warfare.

Richard Browning, who has been dubbed the ‘Iron Man’ of Wiltshire, has constructed a personal flight suit and amazed delegates at this year’s TED Conference when he lifted off from the short of Vancouver Harbour.

Mr Browning, a Royal marine reserve, said a member the British military had already displayed interest in the suit, and had told him that the Ministry of Defence had given up on the idea of flying soldiers until they saw his design.

Although the MoD told the Telegraph they were unaware of the conversation, they said they are currently looking for ‘innovative military solutions’ as part of an £800 million scheme to improve defence.|||
