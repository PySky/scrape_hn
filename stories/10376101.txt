Can you actually sell yourself through your resume? Well, I don’t think so.

I know, what I am saying is nothing different. Why am I saying? So that YOU start making the difference.

Many juniors in my college come to me and ask one big question:

“Sir, would joining this college club help me in building my resume? Sir, what else should I do to build my resume?”

Right question? Maybe. Worth asking? I say— NO

One of my juniors asked me to share my opinion of how I see my career as. So here’s a little from my journey.

When I came to college, I was of the opinion that as always, there would be people to help me and I would have to do minimal effort to grow myself, to create an identity. I didn't know it would be so difficult. Not going into the details, I soon realized that if I want to make it big, I would have to expose myself to opportunities outside college.|||
