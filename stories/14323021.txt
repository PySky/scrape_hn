As the DevOps movement grew and permeated enterprises around the world, looking for faster and more reliable delivery, scaling became the “holy grail” of DevOps (as with Agile).

“We’ve done a pilot, we’ve seen a couple of teams grow autonomous and high-performant, we’ve seen the benefits of responding quickly to business and customer needs. Now we just need to scale this to all our teams.”

Alas, DevOps is not a framework or a method that we can copy and paste. It is a movement focused on changing culture because it makes business sense (as widely reported in the yearly State of DevOps Report). But culture is context. And the larger the organization, the more co-existing cultures there are, each with its own challenges.

This eMag collects articles that explore how to go about scaling DevOps in large organizations – effectively identifying cultural challenges that were blocking faster and safer delivery – and the lessons learned along the way. We include a couple of practices that can help disseminate those lessons.
