Are you ready to take a ride on a driverless bus?

Members of the public are now testing an autonomous pod on the streets of Greenwich in London.

The GATEway shuttle stands at 5 feet high and travels at speeds up to 10mph.

The cute bug-eyed bus is expected to transport more than 100 visitors during the 3-week pilot.|||
