If you get pw3ned, might want to fix your shell

This is a rather silly POC of a vulnerability in custom shell prompt scripts that I suspect is rather widespread. I noticed when working on a branch that included (for the sake of cuteness) a that my prompt that usually includes the branch name had a bunch of gibberish. I suspected the zsh pluging I was using did not properly escape shell metacharacters, so I tried a few more things and landed on this.|||
