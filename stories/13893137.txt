The DrugAge database contains an extensive compilation of drugs, compounds and supplements (including natural products and nutraceuticals) with anti-ageing properties that extend longevity in model organisms. Our focus is on drugs/compounds potentially impacting on ageing, and therefore drugs/compounds extending lifespan in disease-prone animals (e.g., cancer models) are excluded.

Search DrugAge for any term (case insensitive) or browse all the data .

DrugAge is manually curated by experts to ensure high-quality content. You can view DrugAge's statistics. Release notes for the current build are also available.

When deemed to contain essential information for DrugAge (e.g. a large scale assay), certain papers were included without analysing the statistical significance of the results. These results are labelled with 'NS' in the significance field.

Please enter the word(s) you wish to search. The search is case insensitive.

We are currently working on a publication describing DrugAge. Data will be made available for download once we have published our results.
