This includes all future emails that Michael Cheney creates as well.

What you would have to do to make money with Commissionology is just que these emails up in your autoresponder, copy and paste them on your Facebook Fanpage or timeline, favorite social networks, or if you have a blog or a website you can post them on your blog or website as well.

Commissionology is a monthly subscription program and buyers of Commissionology will be getting approx 90+ new affiliate promo messages every single month that you can use as your own in your own affiliate promos.

I myself own commissionology so I may be a bit biased, but I can be lazy when it comes to writing emails, and Michael Cheney is a magician when it comes to email marketing.

His emails have excellent subject lines, tell interesting stories, and get people to click the link at the bottom to increase your affiliate sales.

That is what we all want right? Show me the moneyyyyyyyyyy:)

If you are a bit lazy, and suck at writing emails, then you should consider picking it up you might learn a thing or two about email marketing just by using his done for you affiliate promos.

If you are the lone ranger and like to do everything yourself, and your willing to risk losing affiliate commissions, then do it on your own, it is your choice.

Michael Cheneys Commissionology is a very useful product for internet marketers who hate writing emails to send to there lists.

I have been doing affiliate marketing for ten years, and I can tell you from experience as you probably know that 90% of all the money that you make online will come directly from your email list.

I am very capable of writing my own emails but this product just saves me a massive amount of time, and they stand out in your customers inboxes.

Which directly correlates to more opens, clicks, and sales.
