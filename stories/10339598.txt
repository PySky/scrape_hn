Both traditional and seamless gutters require inspection and maintenance that will ensure proper function and prevent foundation damage or leaks. Even if your gutters are covered with leaf guards, they can still become clogged with debris buildup from rain and snow storms, birds’ nests and shingle remnants.

Roofing experts recommend cleaning and performing general maintenance on your home’s downspouts during spring and fall to prevent warped gutters and leaky gutters.

If you’re tackling the gutter cleaning process on your own, always wear heavy-duty gloves to protect your hands—and remember these helpful hints as you prepare your seamless gutters for fall.

After conducting a thorough gutter cleaning, it’s time to assess your downspout system for maintenance needs.
