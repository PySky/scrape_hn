NASA's 20-year Cassini mission is finally coming to a close. After years of orbiting around the Saturn system and collecting some stellar scientific data, the spacecraft is on a path of certain destruction: on Sunday, the probe officially began the last leg of its mission, which will eventually bring it so close to Saturn that the planet's gravity will drag it down and burn it to smithereens.

But that final dive into oblivion won't occur until September 15. Until then, Cassini will repeatedly dip between Saturn and its ringsâ€”a place no spacecraft has ever gone before. Or, to be more accurate, a place no spacecraft ever had gone before. The probe made its first ring dive on Wednesday, and successfully regained contact with Earth to send pictures home.

And boy, are those pictures something: they show the atmosphere as it's never been seen before. See those swirls? Storms. Just, like, endless storms. My god, it's full of storms. Etc. We've pulled a few for you to look at, but you can check them all out over at NASA's raw image gallery.|||

As NASA's Cassini approaches its final days of life, it's getting ever-closer to Saturn's atmosphere. Read on.
