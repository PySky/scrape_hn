For developers working in the field of computer vision, augmented reality, and to a lesser extent 6DOF tracking for VR, it’s really important to understand the camera properties of the devices that they will be running on.

While there are many important aspects of these cameras, focal length is arguably the most important because even small differences in focal length effect how you interpret depth. This is especially important for recovering scale from the camera.

I wanted to create a 35mm equivalent reference for the top used phones in the US, because they are easiest to work with.

I figured I’d share to others could benefit. These are sourced from around the web, so please let me know if you have any updates.
