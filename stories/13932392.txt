checkrestart, part of debian-goodies, checks what you might need to restart. You can run it after a system update, and it will find running processes using outdated libraries. If these can be restarted, and there's no new kernel updates, then you can save yourself a reboot.

However, is pretty dated, and has some weird behaviour. It frequently reports that there are things needing a restart, but that it doesn't feel like telling you what they are. (This makes me moderately angry). It's pretty bad at locating services on a systemd-managed system. It tries to look through Debian packages, making it Debian specific (along with unreliable). This is especially odd, because systemd knows what pid belongs to a unit, as does , and...

Instead of fixing it, I have rewritten it from scratch.

find-deleted is a tool to find deleted files which are still in use, and to suggest systemd units to restart.

The default is to try and be helpful:

Here, it is telling us that a number of services need a restart. The services are categorised based on some patterns defined in the associated configuration file, .

For this machine, I have decided that restarting and will cause a in the service to users; I might do it at an off-peak time, or ensure that there's other replicas of the service available to pick up the load.

My other categories are:

If you're happy with its suggestions, you can copy-paste the above commands, or you can run it in a more automated fashion:

This can effectively be run through provisioning tools, on a whole selection of machines, if you trust your matching rules! I have done this with a much more primitive version of this tool at a previous employer.

It can also print the full state that it's working from, using .|||
