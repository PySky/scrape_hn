The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is now able to support IPv6 clients using HTTP(S), SSL proxy and TCP proxy load balancing. The load balancer will accept IPv6 connections from users, and proxy those over  IPv4 to virtual machines (i.e. instances). This allows instances to appear as IPv6 services to IPv6 clients.

At the moment, this functionality is an alpha release and is not currently recommended for production use but it demonstrates a commitment to support IPv6 services. GCP allocates a /64 address range for forwarding purposes.

Google Cloud Platform is a cloud computing service offering website and application hosting, data storage and compute facilities on Google’s infrastructure.

More information on how to set-up IPv6 support is available on the GCP website.|||
