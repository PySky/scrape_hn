Roger Jin was 14 when he first decided to be an entrepreneur. He accelerated his college coursework and moved directly to Silicon Valley, where he crashed on a friend's couch and launched his first start-up. After that first start-up failed, he worked a couple of jobs. Then he launched Treats, the subscription, mail-order international snack service that made him rich.
