Orchestra is a Clojure library made as a drop-in replacement for clojure.spec.test.alpha, which provides custom instrumentation that validates all aspects of function specs. By default, clojure.spec will only instrument . This leaves out and from automatic validation; Orchestra checks all of them for you.

; Depending on your Clojure version, choose one of the following. All of them ; provide the same API but follow different internal spec changes. [orchestra ] [orchestra ]

Just replace your and forms to reference instead of . No further code changes required!

Just as with vanilla Clojure, begin your instrumentation by calling:

If you're not familiar with Clojure's instrumentation, it's worth reading the official spec guide. In short, after calling , every call to a function which you've spec'd will have its arguments, return value, and spec validated, based on the specs you've provided.

This magic is possible by rebinding the var, to which your spec'd functions are bound, with a different function which first checks all arguments, then calls the original function, then checks the and specs, if they're present.

I highly recommend having this always on during development and testing. You may have systems tests, rather than unit tests, and this can help verify that your data stays in the exact shape you intended.
