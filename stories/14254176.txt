In the past, the fabrication of gecko-inspired surfaces is mostly related to chemistry and were usually classified into two types: (i) etching and casting, namely casting the polymer into an etched mold and then demolding; (ii) gas phase growth, such as CVD growth of nanotube or nanowire arrays. However, these methods are complicated,  inefficient  and  never cost-effective, which has greatly hampered the applications of gecko- inspired surfaces in engineering.  In order to deal this problem, Prof. Yu Tian et al. proposed an ultraprecision method based on diamond cutting to fabricate the molds of wedge-structured gecko-inspired surfaces. By a simple demolding process, the gecko-inspired surface with fine wedged structures can be achieved. Based on flexible control of the adhesion and friction of the wedge-structured gecko-inspired surfaces, a gecko-inspired gripper successfully demonstrates the process of picking up, holding, and releasing of silicon wafers  both in atmospheric conditions and in vacuum.
