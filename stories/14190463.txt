If you have not heard about Hakuna Matata outside Disney's Lion King story, then you are well guarded and not attacked by a ransomware. Ransomware attacks have been widespread since early 2016 and Hakuna Matata is one among other known such as Cryptolocker, Reveton.

Couple of weeks ago, my home server was attacked rendering important files in the server useless. While we monitor and keep work servers up-to-date, home server does not get the same attention. This is my experience dealing with it and raising importance of home server to shield from future mishaps.

Being a hacker myself, I'm well aware of this attack vector and left the network relatively weak as hackers have traditionally used malware or targeted attacks to cause harm.

Since the impact was limited, I continued to implement better prevention strategies.

While using service like dropbox.com or google drive could easily protect from ransomware, it is not sufficient as the next attacker could access your information and exploit your identity or credit profile.

If you need to use remotely, tighten system access, network security and irrespectively follow secure browsing practices.

Quick search on google provides a number of removal tools for HakunaMatata but it is always recommended to reinstall the infected system for guaranteed cleanup.

This is a good solution for home network media server. It provides minimal surface attack and protects from unwarranted access, brute force attack, ransomware and unauthorized file system access. I will still continue to take manual backups regularly and save it offline as secondary solution, which saved the day!

If you follow alternate strategies or have suggestions, I would love to hear in the comments.|||
