Thanks Sérgio – this is great stuff.

I used to have it working with Qt Creator on macOS, but now I just get “error: unable to load plugin ‘ClangLazy.dylib'” errors even though the path to that lib is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. It also doesn’t compile with the latest homebrew llvm (which is 4.0), so you need to install 3.9 explicitly.

Any chance clazy will be added as a tool in Qt Creator at some point? Would be more convenient!|||
