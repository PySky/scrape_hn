May the 4th be with you. 5.4 is, in fact, the release that you have been looking for.

It is, again, a substantive release with features and functionality in nearly all areas of the Elastic Stack. And, as per usual, it is available – right now – on Elastic Cloud.

The headlining feature of this release is the addition of machine learning features (in beta) to X-Pack. Machine learning means many things to many people, but in this initial release, we focused on making it easy to detect anomalies in time series data. For many of our users, it has become impractical to spot infrastructure problems, cyber attacks, or business issues by only eyeballing dashboards or creating rules. X-Pack machine learning features automatically model the normal behavior of your time series data to detect what isn’t.

Note that machine learning is not yet enabled on Elastic Cloud. Stay tuned for updates!

We can’t overstate our excitement about this automated anomaly detection capability in X-Pack..

For more detailed information, and many other features, peruse the Elasticsearch detail post.

Hear, hear! The Watcher UI is here! Accessible from Kibana’s Management app, it’s now easy to create, manage and track your watches. Easily acknowledge alerting watches or deactivate them during known service periods. You can even test your watches right in the UI.

Use the new cluster alerts feature in X-Pack monitoring to proactively detect issues in your Elastic Stack. Cluster alerts will display in the top-level view of the Monitoring app in Kibana. If your cluster status is red, for example, you will see a prominent notification and information about the error.

We don’t ‘let the beat drop’ but we drop the updates in a detail post.
