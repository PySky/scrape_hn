Social networks and social media are ubiquitous! Every aspect of modern life involves sharing and social interaction, Imagine an environment where business users can access a business intelligence and analysis portal and see popular data to rate, share and comment. This type of sharing can optimize resources by allowing users to access reports, dashboards and data that might be just what they need to complete a task or analysis. When you implement social media and social networking within the Business Intelligence environment business users can share, rate, discuss and learn from others.

With Social BI, organizations will see the emergence of power users who take a creative, insightful approach to data analysis. Just as social media users can 'Like' or 'Share' a provocative post from another user, a social business intelligence tool can support the same kind of sharing and learning within your organization.

As power users, and data analysis, become 'popular', the enterprise will see improved user adoption of BI tools and begin to understand the types of data that users value, and how to provide, and present, data to improve data leverage, and increase confidence in decisions. Understanding the social aspect of data analysis, and data popularity allows the enterprise to make decisions about additional provisioning of data, reports and dashboards to business users.|||
