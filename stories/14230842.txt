What is "the" CO2 intensity (emissions) from consuming 1kWh from the national grid?

The first thing to understand is that CO2 emissions or intensity per kWh generated for (and thus drawn from) the grid is not constant; it varies by time of day and by season because of fuel mix and transmission losses and transmission patterns/routes (which means that it also matters slightly where on the grid you draw from).

Also, with significant penetration of intermittent renewables such as wind (~5% of peak winter demand 2008/2009 with a target of maybe 50% of peak) then the hour-by-hour intensity is even more volatile and hard to know.

There are several different 'average' values quoted and used too, eg: the UK government's 'aspirational' marginal cost of about 0.43kgCO2/kWh, the DEFRA 3-year rolling average figure (0.52kgCO2/kWh as of 2008/2009), 0.422kgCO2/kWh for grid-supplied electricity and 0.568kgCO2/kWh grid-displaced electricity to compute emissions for UK building regulations (2006, part L).

Incidentally, a working assumption of mine has been that grid CO2 intensity will peak when demand does because everything will be working flat out, including all the 'dirtiest' (most CO2-intense) generators. Clare Hanmer of the Carbon Trust did some work that suggests this is not necessarily so, and also that the diurnal/daily swing in intensity is larger in summer than in winter, given some educated guesses, etc. Part of my reason for this note is to test her interesting assertions! I'm borrowing some of her numbers and assumptions shamelessly.

For the GB system, (ie the UK excluding Northern Ireland) ELEXON provides real-time and historical data on a number of grid parameters through the bmreports.com site, including generation by fuel type of plant connected to the high voltage transmission system. This does not by any means represent all generation, and may in particular under-represent wind and other distributed generation that connects at lower voltages and even within the distribution networks.

Total operational metered wind is shown with capacity 1288MW at 2009/03/10, whereas the BWEA lists (for the whole UK) 3301MW capacity. (Site http://www.renewableuk.com/en/renewable-energy/wind-energy/uk-wind-energy-database/ as of 2013/07.)

As at 2009/06/19 the BWEA UKWED database shows 3625MW of operational UK wind capacity and the BWEA's Jan Matthiesen kindly told me that 215MW of that is in Northern Ireland, ie not in the GB grid. At the same time the Elexon GB metered wind capacity is 1426MW, ie ~60% of the UK's operational capacity is embedded and not visible in Elexon's stats, so wind already is a significantly 'distributed' source.

ELEXON has very helpfully licensed me their data to conduct this study and related work.

For the first 24-hour period that I examined from early March 2009, and ignoring the effects of pumped storage and interconnectors entirely, I saw ~20% variation in intensity in the 'high-voltage' connected generation, and an average for a consumer (including 9% loss in transmission/distribution) of well above the government's 'aspirational' marginal-generation figure and slightly above the 3-year DEFRA rolling-average. The intensity was fairly flat (and high) until about 8pm (after peak demand), and dropped to a low around midnight and rose again to 'high' around 8am, so showing a fairly strong first-order correlation of intensity with demand. There may have been more coal and less nuclear in the mix than typical.

This 24-hour period during a bank-holiday weekend shows a 24% variance in kgCO2/kWh; intensity is relatively low because there is relatively little coal in the mix (<20%).

Effective grid carbon intensity for a domestic user is currently 327gCO2/kWh including transmission and distribution losses of 9%.

Latest available grid generation carbon intensity (ignoring transmission/distribution losses) is approximately 300gCO2/kWh at Mon Apr 13 00:55:00 BST 2009 over 26467MW of generation, with a rolling average over 24h of 350gCO2/kWh.

For some reason there seems to have been an enormous (~40%) variation min to max; hour-by-hour variation is ~30%. (Overnight intensity then dropped to 289gCO2/kWh making the mean 381gCO2/kWh and variability a whopping 44%!)

The intensity curve is unusually flat with coal apparently doing load-following (only ~7% min to max, and within a couple of days was down to ~4%), probably because of the gas shortage in the cold weather (with a gas demand of 441m^3/4.9TWh or ~200GW average over the day, causing National Grid to issue a Gas Balancing Alert (GBA) at 13:10 for Gas Day 04/01/2010, and demand went higher still later in the week) and a lack of (nuclear, ie low-carbon) electricity imports from France. There is also a big change in usage given the first two working days back since Christmas.

This was an unseasonably-cold day with the unusual circumstance of very flat (~6%) grid intensity (possibly due to exports to France) with peak demand still being in the lowest intensity quartile.

For the last few days, partly because of the very cold weather across Europe, the normal pattern has been broken with highest carbon intensity seen in the wee hours even though demand is low, and the lowest intensity around peak times and with pumped storage in use.

One consequence is that the 'supergreen' flag has not been active for days, which would be the normal combination of bottom-quartile intensity and no draw-down from storage. I haven't seen this behaviour before.

Note that wind generation has varied between ~100MW and well over 2GW, so that is not the main factor: high and consistent coal-fired generation has probably had a bigger effect. Note the relatively flat (~9%) intensity. We were exporting ~3GW to France and the Netherlands around the sample time, and have probably been proping up the French and German grids with our coal.

Very interesting lack of correlation between demand and intensity overnight.

At this point about 50% of GB demand as seen by Elexon was coming from zero-carbon sources: 80% of that nukes and most of the rest from wind. (Note that about half of wind is not metered here, and these numbers also looked better from a zero-carbon point of view a little earlier.)

Similar to Saturday, peak output from solar ~8GW of ~12GW total capacity; almost none metered at tranmission level so is seen as reduced demand. Second time that the afternoon metered demand has been lower than night.

Also note point during day with no pumped storage demand; possibly a first.

2017/04/30: At 4am (UTC) zero-carbon generation was 14GW out of 21GW demand.

Note that most solar PV cannot be seen in this intensity measure, and at 10am (UTC) even though not universally sunny, effective grid carbon intensity for a domestic user is ~138gCO2/kWh (and falling) including transmission and distribution losses of 7%, cf burning natural gas for heat at ~190gCO2/kWh.

The fuel-mix (FUELINST) data is only available from Nov 2008, so here is an initial analysis for the whole of 2009. (I intend to update this periodically with new data.) This is generation intensity, ie ignoring transmission/distribution losses.

Note how carbon intensity is higher during the day, during the working week, and in the colder winter months, all where demand is highest; ie there is a fairly clear correlation between demand and intensity.

Note also how the mean variability (ie the maximum available CO2 savings from load-shifting) during each day varies from a low of 8% mid-winter to more than 4 times that in summer/autumn. My assumption is that nuclear (baseload) and renewables (zero carbon) are effectively used preferentially in the grid, but demand above their generation is satisfied by increasingly carbon-intense fuels, firstly gas (eg relatively-clean CCGT) all the way up to coal. In winter the zero/low carbon fuels make only a relatively small dent, but moving towards summer at night they cover a large chunk of demand and bring carbon intensity down further than is possible in winter.

It seems to be a good idea from an intensity point of view as well as an infrastructure-sizing and cost point of view to avoid running deferrable load at times of peak demand. If you can delay major loads (such as the dishwasher or washing machine at home) until late in the evening or the small hours after midnight you will probably significantly reduce your carbon footprint.

Note, however, that if the only reduction is a virtual one because of relatively fixed non-dispatchable zero-carbon generation (nuclear), then in order to achieve real footprint/emission reductions, and not just make everyone else's consumption higher/browner, you may have to defer load until other zero-carbon sources do increase output eg because the wind is blowing stronger or the sun shining brightly, rather just when zero/low carbon sources happen passively to form a higher proportion of extant demand. Having said that, if the demand curve becomes flatter though behaviour changes, then it will be possible to have (for example) more nuclear in the mix, and reduce the inherent waste of energy in using (eg pumped) storage, which would reduce long-term carbon footprint through requiring less fossil-fuel peak-demand support. This area requires more analysis.

Here is the 2010 analysis: note that mean generation intensity for the year seems to have risen from 428gCO2/kWh in 2009 to 444gCO2/kWh in 2010, with less scope for emissions savings from load shifting.

The numbers may simply be slightly wrong due to a number of factors, eg:

Capacity of WIND up significantly this year, but so was burning of COAL due to good "dark spread" vs "spark spread" and Large Combustion Plant Directive deadline drawing near, so mean grid intensity was significantly up from last year. (Though more embedded renewables, and possibly biomass cofiring not reflected in these numbers properly, probably means that this overstates the case.)

Note that apparent available savings from load-shifting are falling year-on-year also.

Overall mean intensity dropped from 419gCO2/kWh in 2014 to 367gCO2/kWh, but also note the general fall in intensity after April when lots of coal generation went off-line, bringing winter means down from something like 430gCO2/kWh in 2014 to more like 340gCO2/kWh.

As of 2009/05/10 I had one hosted Web server drop to reduced power mode unless it can detect that the status is 'green' over HTTP, and also our dishwasher was controlled via X10 and the HEYU software to run when grid status is 'green' with status updated hourly to ensure that a 'quick' wash (<1h) could not be interrupted, but the dishwasher control had to stop when we 'upgraded' to a replacement that could not simply be turned on at the wall and work.

Let us first assume that on average each household could defer 1kWh from the day/evening to overnight each day, which is about one warm/hot wash load for example. Many families will be running more than one a day, for example, so only need to defer some of their normal activity.

That would be 365kWh/household deferred from near maximum to near minimum intensity if it can be timed roughly right.

According to my partial data and analysis above it looks as though there's at least 100g/day (~20%) of CO2 to be saved per shifted kWh over the year as at 2009 (higher including summer months).

That suggests >30kg CO2 emissions per year saved by this for each load timeshifted per day.

That is the same saving as turning off our heating entirely for half a week in the middle of 2009's very severe winter.

Given a target that Europeans (well, everyone on the planet, but India and China are there more or less in 2009) should be aiming for of (say) total 2tCO2 per person per year that's maybe 2% of the total allowance so quite significant, with the remaining portion looking like 10%+ of that target 2t/y.

I take from this incidentally that we can probably keep our (efficient) dishwashers and washing machines and such mod cons and meet that target.|||
