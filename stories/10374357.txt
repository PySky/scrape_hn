Through the Public Library Partnerships Project (PLPP), DPLA has been working with existing DPLA Service Hubs to provide digital skills training for public librarians and connect them sustainably with state and regional resources for digitizing, describing, and exhibiting their cultural heritage content.

During the project, DPLA collaborated with trainers at Digital Commonwealth, Digital Library of Georgia, Minnesota Digital Library, Montana Memory Project, and Mountain West Digital Library to write and iterate a workshop curriculum based on documented best practices. Through the project workshops, we used this curriculum to introduce 150 public librarians to the digitization process.

Now at the end of the project, we’ve made this curriculum available in a self-guided version intended for digitization beginners from a variety of cultural heritage institutions. Each module includes a video presentation, slides with notes in Powerpoint, and slides in PDF. Please feel free to share, reuse, and adapt these materials.

These modules follow the flow of the digitization process and each is presented by different members of the curriculum writing team. Many thanks to the hubs who collaborated to develop and test this curriculum, the PLPP participants for providing us with feedback on how to improve it, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for its generous funding.
