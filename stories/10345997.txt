Everlaw is committed to using and contributing to open-source software. Participating in the global network of millions of open-source developers helps us bring the most advanced and efficient technologies to the legal space.

Today, we are releasing a substantial new open-source project that has broad applicability to developers of every stripe, not just those working on legal software: a TypeScript plugin for NetBeans. NetBeans is an open-source integrated development environment that Everlaw’s developers use to write the code that powers the Everlaw platform. Think of it as a personal programming assistant that does some of the mechanical work involved in building a large application, and points out many bugs before they even get run. TypeScript is a variant of JavaScript that enables more rapid and bug-free development of the code that runs in your web browser when you visit any modern website.

This plugin, whose development was led by Everlaw engineer Jeffrey Morlan, enables any software engineer writing TypeScript in NetBeans to leverage advanced development features more commonly afforded to server-side programming languages like Java. Programmers can use it when creating any kind of website to increase their efficiency and the quality of their code.

We’re deeply indebted to the open-source community for the array and quality of tools we use every day to run Everlaw, and we’re happy to contribute back in any way we can! You can view all of our open-source contributions on Github.|||
