1) You are your first investor.  Cash flow from operations can be used to grow rather than cover your costs.

2) Most startups fail. Having another source of income allows you to pivot when things aren't working

3) It will take longer to scale than you think...and more money.

4) The extra demands on your time will force you to focus on only what's important.  When you do leave your job, hopefully, keep that focus.|||
