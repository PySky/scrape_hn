An implementation of EFCore provider + ADO.Net connector to the Google Spanner DB.

You can use EF on top of Spanner db!

For further examples refer to the QueryTests and UpdateTests classes.

Under the hood it uses, Google unofficial Spanner dotnet api. It is an auto generated code with no abstraction on top of it. Once the API will be officialy public, we will integrate it over here. See the current unofficial SDK: Google Cloud Spanner DotNet Entity Framework Core: We use the latest EFCore - 1.1 version

Async/Await: The lib actually supports async/await, however, seems that EFCore has an issue with navigation properties async loading so, it might cause deadlock in some scenarios (be careful): #8208 The sessions created against Google Spanner are not handled optimizely. Session pool should be implemented in the official API SDK of the Google.Cloud.Spanner, so we will integrate thier solution then. Transaction is very limited - only one save is allowed during one transaction.

The following types are supported:
