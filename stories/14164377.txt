JAMB SHOULD BE SCRAB INSTEAD OF POST JAMB

The joint admission and matriculation board (jamb) was established in 1978 to conduct an external exam for candidates seeking admission into tertiary institution and oversee how admission will conducted in accordance with the score quota. The exam body have been doing well in their part for long time ago but recently it facing inept management issues.Joint admission and matriculation board served as a channel for getting admission into the university of your choice, Then it was a straight method approach, when you write jamb exam after you passed it you will be given admission automatically without sitting for post post jamb.Why jamb need to be scrab is that many student that i got admission into the university through jamb are getting due to poor academic performance, because jamb can be manipulated unlike post jamb that can not be manipulated. As a administrator in university system i have seen a lot of student been withdrawn due academic poor performance.Sometimes last year a student wanted to study mathematics in an interview, she was ask to draw a triangle, she can't, many related cases like that had happen in the university, at the end of it they will be advise to go and get a inter/intra faculty transfer form to faculty of education.The parent too played a big foul play in the life of their children in the sense that they decide the type of life the children will live the kind of course they will offer when they get to higher institution all this contribute to the failure of their children.I urge the parent and understand how they feel about their children to stand out among  peer groups, it wasn't an easy task i must confess but there is limit to the pampering and caring. how long do we want to  keep or guide our children under-watch, we should spare and let them decide alone sometimes.The advent of technological advancement  was a great development for the entire world, unlike the joint admission and matriculation board where there is no free-hitch for the student to have access to the computer. millions of student sitting for the exam are computer illiterate.So this also bring a set to the exam body (jamb) this made them to look inefficient in their performance, because the parent won't accept the blame that they are at fault, but ready to point abusive fingers to jamb and the federal government.|||
