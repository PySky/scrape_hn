Reference implementations for variational autoencoder, autoencoder, generative adversarial network and adversarial variational bayes I implemented in tensorflow.

I managed to get them working for the autoencoder and variational autoencoder using the beautiful class structure described by Danijar here.

Input and reconstructions from the variational autoencoder:

Samples drawn from the latent space of the variational autoencoder and the corresponding reconstructions:
