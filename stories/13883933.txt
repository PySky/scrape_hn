TSON, short for Typed JSON, is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like document that support javascript typed data.

TSON is a binary format in which zero or more key/value pairs are stored as a single entity. We call this entity a document.

The following grammar specifies version 1.1.0 of the TSON standard. We've written the grammar using a pseudo-BNF syntax. Valid TSON data is represented by the document non-terminal.

The following basic types are used as terminals in the rest of the grammar. Each type must be serialized in little-endian format.

The following specifies the rest of the TSON grammar. Note that we use the * operator as shorthand for repetition (e.g. ("\x01"*2) is "\x01\x01"). When used as a unary operator, * means that the repetition can occur 0 or more times.|||
