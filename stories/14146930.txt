It was the music industry that embraced the power of the ‘hologram‘ to break down these walls. With CGI, 3D technology and a wafer-thin screen, you didn’t need an artist to be present to deliver a rousing performance that live audiences felt moved by.

The first landmark hologram performance came at Coachella 2012 – when the late rapper Tupac Shakur was revived on stage to perform alongside Snoop Dogg and Dr.Dre, and later everyone from Michael Jackson (who moonwalked at the Billboard Music Awards) to Elvis Presley (who could perform hour-long concerts) have been brought back from the dead.

More recently, the Asian music market realised you don’t have to be dead to capitalise on the captivating power of the hologram. K-pop hologram concerts take place daily in Seoul, and one of the world’s biggest pop stars, is Japan’s Hatsune Miku – a hologram herself.

Now politicians have started to join the craze: Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, and President Erdogan of Turkey, have both used holograms to address crowds.

This week, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left French presidential candidate, appeared at seven rallies simultaneously. The move prompted Antonin André, political correspondent for Europe 1 radio, to name Mélenchon the “Tom Cruise of the web”.

With this kind of response, you can bet that other world leaders will soon follow suit.|||

Hologram politics? First Tupac - next Theresa May.
