This apparatus creates stroboscopic patterns on an egg covered in photochromic paint. Such paint temporarily changes the color (from white to purple in this case) when illuminated by UV light. Here we use violet laser cannibalized from blu-ray drive and a scanning unit cannibalized from a laser printer. In the laser printer, this unit projects the printing image line by line on a rotating photoconductive drum, but here it projects various pattern line by line on the rotating egg.



Those patterns are carefully designed and calculated to create an illusion of animation when captured by a camera (or illuminated using stroboscopic light). You see exactly what the camera captures---no aftereffects were used. This device is a kind of zoetrope (an old device used for animation), but it allows to change the pattern dynamically. 



I used similar patterns in the previous video Eggstatic https://youtu.be/JfajQ4_hSN0.
