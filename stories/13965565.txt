I was bizarrely intrigued by this question so I went away and wrote some code.Source database is Million Base 2.2 (2.2m master-level tournament games) updated to January 2013 and available fromAnd without further ado here's the data:So both kings (e1 and e8) survive the most. Next up, surprisingly, are theh, g, f, a and b-pawns - I think this is because promotion counts as survival under my interpretation.Then come the rooks (around 55% survival) and queens (around 49%).The situation with the c-d-e pawns is very interesting. The most survivable central pawn is the White c-pawn (42%), while White's d-pawn is the most doomed of all the chessmen (24%) - more so even than the knights (~26%). There's a pleasing symmetry in the survival rates of the White and Black c- and e-pawns that suggests they're frequently exchanged on the d-file. Bishops survive around 35% of the time, with the kingside bishops slightly more likely to survive than queenside ones.Everything I found here is broadly in line with's intuitive argument from opening theory, so well done Mac :)In case anyone's wondering how I approached this as a programming problem, a quick trick is toget drawn into writing a whole chessboard representation. Use a tool liketo convert SAN moves (e.g. "Nc3") to long algebraic moves (e.g. "Nb1c3") - since we can safely assume all moves in the PGN are legal, this saves a lot of effort implementing the rules of chess (although you still have to handle castling and en passant carefully).Have some source code!|||
