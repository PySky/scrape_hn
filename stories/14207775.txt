Your photos and videos are the most sensitive data on your smartphone and it is very easy to broadcast them without noticing it. You could share them by mistake in any social media, store them on the cloud making your data vulnerable to any account stealing. Even if you are very careful with the previous problems, you still can be hacked through a malware and so on. Some malwares are quite powerful and could get the data flow from your smartphone cameras and microphones and even track your exact position. No software protection is 100% safe, even those that use encryption. The only solution totally safe you can have it’s through hardware, and that’s what we offer.|||
