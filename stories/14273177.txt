T3X9 is a tiny, yet comprehensible, procedural language, much like Pascal or BCPL, but even more minimal. Its compiler is small and fast. (<1600 lines of T3X self-compile in about 0.05 seconds.) It is a statement rather than a production tool.

Of course, T3X9 would not be a complete project, if there wasn't a book about it!|||
