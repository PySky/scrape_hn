>ION, chasing stock options CAN be worth it if you luck out.

>I carried on doing 60h weeks without overtime, as you do

Actually I usually don't. Might have one or two 60 hr week a year at most. I have built my career up to where I get to pick my employers and not vice versa and spending a reasonable amount of time with my family is near the top of the criteria. That is because I didn't waste time chasing unicorns with all the other technonerds and slow and steady built up skills, experience, a very good 401k, payed off the mortgage and landed my dream job for my needs (slow and steady wins the race, though granted being middle aged really helps). I actually get stock options and bonuses as well but my company is publicly traded and since we actually make something and have turned a profit consistently for nearly two decades the stock options are lucrative but nothing like unicorn sparkly manure. Then again I am not suddenly having to look for a new job every two years or less and very well may retire for my current employer, knock on wood. The helping actually manufacture stuff is very important to me and matching my work environment to my needs means my job is not shortening my life and if anything adds value to it. If being rich means insane overtime creating weapons of financial mass destruction derivatives or facilitating allowing Millennials to post pictures of their breakfast to the world than more power to who wants to go down that road but it won't be me.|||
