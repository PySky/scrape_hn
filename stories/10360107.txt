GEG (Genetic Expression Generator) is a tool used to generate expressions that equate to an arbitrarily inputted integer.

One of the most useful cases for such a tool is for obfuscation routines. However, this tool was mainly created in order to learn concepts in Genetic Algorithms.

A huge thanks to ai-junkie for writing an amazing tutorial on genetic algorithms, and to yati-sagade for introducing me to the ai-junkie tutorial. :)|||
