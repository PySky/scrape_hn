California regulators want to slap a $1.13 million fine on Uber for failing to investigate and/or suspend drunken drivers, according to an order filed by the state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates ride-hailing companies.  The companies must post that policy in their apps and online, provide a way for riders and others to make complaints and promptly suspend drivers for further investigation after a complaint.  Regulators “found no evidence that (Uber) followed up in any way with zero-tolerance complaints several hours or even one full day after passengers filed such complaints,” the order said.    [...] Uber’s standards for how to confirm drunken driving are problematic, the order says.  The company also says it deactivates drivers after three complaints about them driving drunk, even when those complaints are not confirmed.
