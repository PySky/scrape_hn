The digital services that utilize the platform will be used by us all, with a single identity and single sign-on. We can use them in the role of a citizen, and when representing a private or public sector organization. We can also give and receive authorizations for making transactions on behalf of another person or organization. Digital communication and interaction with public authorities will become a lot easier.

The new Suomi.fi Service Views are constantly improving, and they will gradually become the one stop shop to find services and information, and to interact with the public sector. Private sector services will also be included.

The key to success with the National Architecture of Digital Services is that organizations understand the benefits of Suomi.fi Services and take them into use as soon as possible. The services are presented shortly below, with links to service-specific pages.|||
