Inspired by Dr. Michael Burry of “The Big Short” fame, the work of Aspiritech as well as working with Auticon we wondered if it was possible to launch an investment vehicle that would rely on an anonymous network of analysts diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

We started to research and assemble such a network over several months in 2016 and started to invest a small amount of our own money at the beginning of 2017. The results to date – although only from January to April 2017 so far – are promising to say the least. Using the ETF SPDR500 to invest in the US stock market resulted in a gain of 19.4%. In commodities, notoriously difficult markets, the return was 29.8% and in foreign exchange, trading only G10 currencies, a 7.8% profit was achieved.

In all markets positions were either long only or out of the market without any leverage employed.

Our approach is not dissimilar from Quantopian’s or Numerai’s.

However, we exclusively rely on anonymous analysts diagnosed with ASD. We like to think of it as a prime example of Impact Investing. Offering new and attractive income opportunities to a highly disadvantaged group of our society, respecting their circumstances and work preferences while delivering financial returns to investors .

We will continue down this avenue and - once satisfied - potentially launch a crowd and/or crypto token funded investment management company that would create a number of products in the investment/asset/wealth management realm.

Any interest in collaboration is welcome and if suitable will be considered.|||
