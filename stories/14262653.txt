Chakri Deverapalli, a CEO, and Brett Jones, a Navy SEAL and CEO, went homeless for four days on the streets of Huntsville. Watch their journey as they experience the challenges and resources available to the homeless in Huntsville. Also witness the incredible love, support, and kindness of the Huntsville community.



Homeless in Huntsville is an exploration of the struggles faced by the city's homeless population and the organizations dedicated to helping them - It is an outgrowth of a small-team project for Leadership Huntsville/Madison County, the largest community leadership program in Alabama. We hope this video will remind you that there is a story behind the cardboard signs we see the homeless holding.
