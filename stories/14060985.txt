The mission of BibleOrQuran is to educate people about the true nature and content of the Bible and Qur'an. False statements such as "81% of the Qur'an is about killing infidels!" and "The bible teaches only peace!" are commonly thrown around with little evidence to back them up. Despite their lack of credibility, however, they still continue to polarize and cause irrational hate and fear. We hope that by showing random Bible or Qur'an passages, we show how similar the two texts are and allay many of the fears of Islam and its teachings.|||

Teaching the true nature of both texts. See a random passage from either the Bible or the Qur'an and try to choose which religious text it came from.
