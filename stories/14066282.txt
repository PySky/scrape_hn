Why spend hours designing a pixel perfect draft of the page that you later on have to implement? Why not design on the browser with HTML and CSS as your design tools?

Designing in the browser (DITB) has major advantages over designing with Sketch, Photoshop etc. Creating various design drafts for different devices is time consuming and making those designs interactive for prototyping is additional effort.

After all that time spent the final mockup most likely won’t look the same in the browser!

All you need is an editor (I would recommend Visual Studio Code! Best thing from Microsoft!) and a little bit of skills in HTML and CSS.

Tweak is a chrome extension that fits in DITB perfectly. It gives you the benefits of visual design tools on your browser while still using your HTML and CSS. With a click on the extension the page becomes editable and you can add elements and sections.

Tweak is currently in early phase, but I am planning to release it soon for beta.

If you are interested in giving it a try, apply to be a beta user and get Tweak for free!

That’s it! Looking forward to hearing from you!

Oh yeah if you are this far it won’t be much effort to click the little heart and/or follow, right? Thanks!|||
