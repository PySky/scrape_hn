Welcome to Composing Programs, a free online introduction to programming and computer science.

In the tradition of SICP, this text focuses on methods for abstraction, programming paradigms, and techniques for managing the complexity of large programs. These concepts are illustrated primarily using the Python 3 programming language.

In addition to reading the chapters below, you can apply your knowledge to the programming projects that accompany the text and visualize program execution using the Online Python Tutor.
