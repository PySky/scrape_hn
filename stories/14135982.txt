Aspose.3D for .NET is a feature-rich Gameware and Computer-Aided-Designing (CAD) API that empowers Mono and .NET applications including ASP.NET, Windows Forms and Web Services to connect with prevalent 3D document formats automatically without any 3D modeling and rendering software being installed on the server. It supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX and Google Draco file formats, allowing developers to easily create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of these 3D document formats using Aspose.3D API.

The 3D .NET API is user friendly and can be deployed with any .NET application as easy as copying it without worrying about other services and modules that are installed already.|||

Using .NET 3D API - developers can create, read, convert and modify 3D file formats (FBX, STL, Universal3D, Distreet3DS and WavefrontOBJ ) in C#, Windows Forms, Web Services and Mono applications.
