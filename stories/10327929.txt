Since qwikrazor released his bubble method it’s time for me to release our TN-V11 pboot so you can also enjoy this on your PSVita or PSTV. I know a lot of you are going to ask why not 3.51 or 3.52, well just like I said in my previous article without being able to write to the game folder it sucks. I know that there are other tricks out there to write to the game folder, but they can be a hassle to use and it’s just easier to use Ark or VHBL instead.

Some of you may have notice we already updated our guide with the files needed to use the TN-V11 bubble. So to get started on making your TN-V11 bubble for FW3.50 you can visit our guide, here.

Now the other release is called Vita bubble blower this homebrew is very neat and will do all the hard work for you when it comes to making those bubbles.

The sad thing is it only works on FW3.36 and below but if you have two PSVita’s and one is on 3.50Fw these bubbles will work once they are done on your PSVita with FW3.36. We have also included it in our guide, just visit here to start making those bubbles.|||
