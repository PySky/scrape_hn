Usersnap is your solution for collecting user feedback & bug reports. No matter if you‚Äôre creating a new website, or just need a user testing tool for your latest web app.

With the Usersnap widget, your website visitors, testers, and users can leave feedback easily by annotated screenshots with virtual pens and sticky notes directly in the browser.

If you continue with the setup of Basecamp 3 & Usersnap, all screenshots are sent to your Basecamp projects.

If you already have a Basecamp 3 account, you can skip this point and continue with part 3.
