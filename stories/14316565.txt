Low-level means, that it is not focused on fancy features used only in very limited cases. Instead it gives you the tools for quick and easy building the application you need. All the built-in tools are as generic as possible to let you use them in the vast range of situations.

Low-code, because usually you don't need to hand-code at all to build an application. But of course we know the value of hand written code and give you an option to use SQL or attach PHP and JavaScript plugins.|||
