It’s known for flat-pack wood, but Ikea’s made no secret of its digital future.

The Swedish business was quick to embed wireless charging into its furniture, and has already launched its own affordable line of smart lights you can control from your phone.

Now, the company’s Copenhagen-based innovation lab is testing out new digital waters: it’s collecting research on public perception on artificial intelligence (AI).

Launched this weekend by Space10 (the same lab responsible for Ikea’s glorious indoor Growroom), Do You Speak Human? is a global survey to inform Ikea’s future.

It poses questions that refer to how AI might find purpose in your home like “should your AI fulfil your needs before you ask?” and “should your AI prevent you from making mistakes?”

The lab also asks about contentious issues, such as if and when it’s okay to collect user data, and whether AI should be programmed to mirror your views.

Besides the “tech” bits, Ikea also wants to know what kind of bot we want.

And while Apple’s smartphone assistant Siri is automatically female in the States and male in the UK, most people Ikea surveyed (42%) want a gender neutral helper.

Other questions delve into personality traits – like whether an AI helper should be “protective” or “obedient” – or even whether people want their AI to follow their religion (nearly a third do).

Space10 has been keen to describe the survey as “playful research” rather than a study to back a formal project. But if it becomes clear that AI products are what consumers want, the company is hardly going to pass the area by.|||
