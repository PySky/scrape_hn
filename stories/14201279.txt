Alphabet is adding 500 more Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its fleet of self-driving cars, the company announced on Tuesday.

That brings the company’s total fleet of minivans to 600. That’s not including the 70 Lexus vehicles Alphabet is also testing. Fiat Chrysler originally announced that it would manufacture 100 minivans with Alphabet’s autonomous technology back in May.

Since then, what was once Google’s self-driving project — an outfit under Google X — became an official Alphabet subsidiary called Waymo. The company also announced that it is making its vehicles available for public testing in Phoenix. As part of that early-rider program, Phoenix residents can hail Waymo’s self-driving cars via a proprietary app to go to and from work, school and other destinations every day at no cost.

“We want as many people as possible to experience our technology, and we want to bring self-driving cars to more communities sooner,” Waymo CEO John Krafcik wrote.

The company has been working on its autonomous technology since 2009 and hit two million miles of autonomous driving in October 2016.|||
