"Boldly Go!" is a musical of both substance and comedy: a parody based upon the universe of Star Trek. The United Federation of Planets encounters a grave threat from an unknown source. The Starship Enterprise, with its intrepid crew – Captain Kirk, Spock, Doctor McCoy, Nurse Chapel, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov, and Sulu – is dispatched to investigate, going to the very edge of the Neutral Zone. Along the way, they encounter a mysterious alien scientist named Takya, for whom Spock finds himself emotionally susceptible. We also meet a nerdy and surprisingly human-like Klingon named Kharthak, who believes the sinister Klingon Empire could aspire to something greater. In the ensuing tale, the Enterprise faces its greatest challenge yet. Assumptions will be confronted, paradigms challenged, alliances tested, and new contacts made – whether for good or ill as yet to be seen.



While having fun with the sometimes farcical aspects of science fiction and parodying Star Trek, "Boldly Go!" also satirizes the musical theater genre, which, as any musical aficionado knows, comes with its own set of peculiarities and idiosyncrasies. At its core, "Boldly Go!" is a story about being true to oneself and one’s convictions, about friendship and love, about discovery and wonder, about the triumph of the individual over adversity, and about the joy of sharing with each other this vast and mysterious Universe.|||
