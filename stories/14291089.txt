There are times where you need to present your users with clear, quick actions. Although these links will vary depending on your specific content, they can be as simple as various "Learn More", "Purchase", or "Book" links. By providing immediate access to these popular links and actions, you better serve your users and help facilitate engagement.

A common dilemma that often arises is that you do not have enough space available to dedicate to all of your specific links. In such a situation, you can easily implement (1) a grid based container and (2) a slider to handle overflow sections. Combined, this will create a contemporary action grid slider that presents all available links to an end user.

Using Bootstrap and Slick Slider, you can customize your own action grid slider. Below is all of the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get you started.

Use Font Awesome icons (or your own custom graphics) to match the content of your links. Configure Slick Slider options so that you have total control over how the slider operates. Enjoy!|||
