Microsoft has this week unveiled more details about the development kit which is available for companies creating content for the new Xbox One Project Scorpio.

The Xbox One has been around for nearly 4 years and now Microsoft is looking to launch yet another more powerful system before the end of 2017 providing 6 TFLOPS, 326GB/s of memory bandwidth and advanced, custom silicon for gamers to enjoy.



Xbox One Project Scorpio will be competing with the likes of the PlayStation 4 Pro which was launched late last year. One of the selling points of the new Scorpio system to developers is that they need do nothing to their games which may already be supported by the Xbox One to enable them to run on the new more powerful Xbox. Xbox software engineering exec Kareem Choudhry explains more:

You can just write to the original set of [Xbox One] requirements that we have today, and then we’ll do the work to make sure that it actually runs better. But [developers] don’t have to do any custom work for Scorpio. We’re just inviting people to come in and take advantage of it. In terms of requirements if they do decide to take advantage of it, we want that content to run, at minimum the same as but ideally better than it does on the original Xbox One.

Specifications for the Project Scorpio Xbox One system include:

• Scorpio Engine: With 6 TFLOPS, 326GB/s of memory bandwidth and advanced, custom silicon, the Scorpio Engine is the most powerful console gaming processor ever created

 • Centrifugal Fan: A supercharger-style design which rapidly pulls in and compresses air, Project Scorpio’s Centrifugal Fan is crafted to deliver maximum cooling with minimum noise

 • Vapor Chamber: A first for home consoles, Project Scorpio’s Vapor Chamber uses advanced liquid cooling to help ensure the Scorpio Engine stays cool

 • Hovis Method: To maximise performance and minimise power consumption, Project Scorpio uses the Hovis Method, a cutting-edge digital power delivery system to custom tune console voltage

 • Coming holiday 2017
