There are few changes the user ISA specification, and they are primarily improvements to the document itself.  In addition, some holes in the floating-point specification were plugged, including defining the behavior of floating-point operations on mismatched types.



In the privileged architecture, we avoided incompatible changes for M-mode-only implementations of the previous version, 1.9.1.  Several improvements have been made to the supervisor ISA, which are listed in the document's preface.  Those changes are not compatible with version 1.9.1, but we strongly intend forward compatibility for v1.10 of the M-mode and S-mode architectures.



The most prominent change to the privileged architecture is the removal of the Type-1 hypervisor support in favor of a future Type-2 hypervisor extension, along the lines of what Paolo Bonzini, and later John Hauser, have proposed.  We will produce a draft specification for this virtualization scheme this summer and allow ample time for feedback. 

In preparation for these specs being maintained by the Foundation, we have changed the authorship model to distinguish the editors (Krste and me) and the contributors (who are listed in alphabetical order in the document).  Additionally, the Foundation will be the publisher of the specs, rather than UC Berkeley; and both the source and compiled documents are available in the github repo.  We've used a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.  Citation instructions are included on the second page of each document.
