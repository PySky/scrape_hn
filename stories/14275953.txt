I like to know what my credit card balance is. And I don’t want to visit all online bank accounts every day. So I automated this process. In a secure and reusable way.

Meet Kibitzr - Self-hosted web scrapper, that can login to online bank account just like you do and extract balance. Then it will check, if it changed from the last time it send notification. Finally it will send you a message via SMS, e-mail, Telegram, Slack, gitter, you-name-it.

First, it is free. It’s also open-source. And it’s written in Python.

Second, it’s self-hosted. You don’t have to trust any third-party with your bank account credentials.

Kibitzr is configured through YAML file. It means, that you can share snippets for different banks in plain text. One writes the snippet for his bank, whole community benefits.

Here is the snippet for Discover bank. Save it in :

And put your credentials in :

Note how credentials file is individual while check definition is general. There are existing check snippets for Bank of America, Discover, American Express and adding new is a matter of minutes.

If you like the idea and want to be a part of Kibitzr community, please drop a line at Gitter Lobby or join discussion on Hacker News|||
