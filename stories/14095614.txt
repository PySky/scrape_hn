Why do you Resist?

Thousands of people just like you have signed up to join Resistance School, and each has a unique story.  Do you resist to protect the environment?  To provide your children with a better future?  To ensure that everyone has the right to an education?

Tell us why you are resisting — send an email to resistanceschoolphotos@gmail.com, with a photograph of yourself holding up a sign that says why you resist.  Include a couple of sentences about what motivates you. We’ll feature it on our website or Facebook page to make sure your voice is heard.|||
