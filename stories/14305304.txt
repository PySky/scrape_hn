Here are some cool examples. The left side in the examples contains the input and the right side contains the output of Prepack.

The first example is a traditional hello world example:

As you can see, Prepack compiled the code to the smallest version.

The next example contains two functions. Here is the code:

The compiled code is generated from the first function. Function is useless and it is not contain any side effect code, so there is no compiled code associate with .

Pay attention, code that is not in an IIFE is not a fully optimized.

This example shows coding with a for loop. The loop was removed in the compiled code, but there are a lot of unused lines. With an IIFE it will be looks like:

Here you can see that there are only 5 lines of the log operation.

You can try it out by yourself in a special playground in Prepack website (see it in the references section). The playground is the better option for whom don’t want to install it or interest just in playing with Prepack.|||

In the last days, the social networks are stormy about Prepack. Probably you still haven’t heard about it. It’s reasonable! It has been an open source only a few days ago. Prepack has developed by…
