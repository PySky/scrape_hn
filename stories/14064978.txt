Hiya Patrick! I'm good at explaining technical stuff and I really like the vue.js programming language. So I'm considering doing the "blog > email list > ebook" journey that you often talk about on HN. But I have a few questions about this project: - How can I know in advance that people might be interested in new vue JS tutorials? The official documentation is already great... - Is a blog about "Learn Vue.js" enough, or should I try to find a more specific niche? - Where would you market such a blog, besides HN and Reddit? Thanks!|||
