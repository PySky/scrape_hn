Are you at a warehouse and have no access to the internet (WiFI tends to be terrible at warehouses) and urgently need to determine what is in that package you just came across and all you have access to is it’s barcode?

At a bookstore and you want to find out where is the cheapest you could buy it online and your mobile browser keeps crashing and you’ve run out of data?

With voice as the next frontier in pervasive commerce, I am very proud to announce the launch of Semantics3’s Dial-A-UPC

As always, we’ve pushed the technical frontiers in making this product happen. This product is a major milestone in the history of Semantics3, which originally started as a text API company. This signifies our entry into the contextual pervasive commerce arena, with voice as our first play. (Promise: We will not publish a hundred white papers on these buzzwords :)

Call +1–31DIAL-UPC-1 or (313) 425 8721 and enter in your barcode followed by the pound sign.

You will get information regarding the name of the product, the category of the product and where it could be purchased online at what price.

Here are some examples you can try out (we picked random stuff lying around in our office) :)

A book about Platform Growth (very important book in our opinion)!

A pack of “Emergen-C” Vitamin C drink (daily dose for maximum customer support effectiveness!)

And finally, a superb Glenmorangie 18 year whiskey (our office favorite for when we have a happy customer)|||
