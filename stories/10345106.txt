Apple has just been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office a new patent named "Camera accessory for angled camera viewing"Â and describing how an angled camera accessory might be used to develop a virtual keyboard.

As outlined in the patent, "magnetic structures and other structures may be used in coupling the electronic device to the support structures and may be used in coupling the camera accessory to the electronic device."

Given that Apple already uses magnetic coupling between various elements of their devices, a future accessory that can be attached to a Mac's camera to create a virtual keyboard is not that far-fetched.

Furthermore, Apple also explains in the patent that an angled camera accessory may also be used to record subjects that couldn't have been previously recorded using perpendicularly mounted cameras.

The new accessory would allow a Mac's camera to record at unusual angles using a reflector system designed to deflect light and, therefore, allowing the camera sensor to capture information "in an off-axis direction."

The patent also details how another component attached to the camera in one of their electronic devices might be able to project the image of a virtual keyboard on a surface, hence creating a new means of gathering user input besides the classic physical keyboard and mouse.

The "Camera accessory for angled camera viewing" patent was originally filed on September 20, 2012, by Nicholas G. L. Merz, a senior Apple product designer in the iPod/iPhone group and the owner of a Stanford Product Design degree.

Also, Nicholas G. L. Merz is listed as an inventor on more than 14 different patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.|||
