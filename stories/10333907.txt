Port of TinyWM in Go.

Add the file to the xsessions directory. This will add a new selection to the list of window managers at the login screen.

This file runs /usr/bin/tinywm-session. Create that file now.

tinwm-session preloads a terminal and then runs the go binary. Build the binary and move it to /usr/bin/.

Log out. You should now see tinywm as an option in the list. Choose it a log in. You should have a bare WM with a terminal emulator running.

Issues and PR's are welcome! :) Feel free to hit me on twitter @collinglass.|||
