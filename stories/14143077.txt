Grokbit aims to simplify common programming tasks. Imagine quickly finding a function's definition and its usages, across multiple repos or revisions, renaming it with a few clicks, and having pull requests automatically generated.

But there's more. By now code repositories store a substantial amount of human culture. Yet it remains hard to dig into a repo, whether it's jQuery, the Linux kernel, or your company's codebase. We want to make code exploration easier and more fun.

Pulling this off requires a wide mix of technologies. We've built lightning-fast parsers in the backend along with innovative data structures to power search and navigation. In the frontend we use web workers, websockets, and dynamic rendering to deliver the best possible UX.

Let's talk If this sounds interesting, maybe you should join us. We're looking for people to work remotely on the project. We don't care about your age, where you live, your gender, or which framework you've been using. We care about furious speed, discipline, and an artist's hunger for great work.|||
