This is the collection of algorithms, data structures and Interview Questions with solutions. This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in Java. I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously.

Algorithms, Data Structures and more than 200 Problems and Solutions are provided so far.

Here are questions divided by difficulty level:
