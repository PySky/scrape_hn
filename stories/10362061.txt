We continue our PASS Summit interview series, and today we talk to Carlos Bossy (Blog | Twitter) about Hadoop, Hive and the Hadoop ecosystem in general.

There are many technologies in the Hadoop zoo, and we explain what those technologies do, how they work compared to SQL Server tools, and when to use which technology.

We also compare R to T-SQL, and even talk a tiny bit about MongoDB.
