All entrepreneurs by nature are risk takers; they like to be in charge of where their business is headed.

But today’s entrepreneurs are wired differently from those who grew up with the typewriter.

Today’s entrepreneur believes technology allows him a greater measure of control. This is why he tends to be more confident in finding technology-based solutions than people-based solutions. So if you suggest hiring a virtual assistant when business starts to scale up, he may give you the “are you still living in the Dark Ages?” look.

For him, people’s emotions make them flawed and unpredictable. He would not have the same measure of control as he would with technology.

But as technology has evolved, so has the VA. Virtual assistants have embraced technology as much as the entrepreneur. (Perhaps even more because technology is the engine that runs their business.)

Can a software program identify a change in demand or market preference on the fly?

No. You need empathy and keen human observation for that.

Instead of looking at emotion as a handicap, view it as an asset that allows for adaptability and flexibility.

The foundation of virtual assistance work is administrative support because it is responsible for creating efficiency; the cornerstone of which is the ability to organize.

This is why, regardless of skill, any virtual assistant should provide above-board administrative support.

Most start-ups and small businesses fail because of poor internal control systems such as effective money management.

All businesses regardless of size should be regularly appraised on their financial position via cash flow statements, cash disbursement schedules and income statements.

These are valuable references that guide you on how to fund projects or strategies without compromising operations.

The VA for accounting can also do the following:

What exactly should you know about your financials? Read more here:

Whether you’re expanding your services or working on a project in a new-to-you industry, get valuable information about your clients’ field and competition without having to do it yourself.

Virtual assistants adept in conducting comprehensive market research can provide the following (and more):

You’ll also have the advantage an objective, third-party perspective on your market study.

With more than 3 billion daily users of the Internet, nearly a million websites and a multitude of online social networking platforms, making social media really work for you can be ridiculously time-intensive.

Instead, hire a virtual assistant with experience and expertise to implement strategy, purpose and consistency in a social media campaign.

Making time for your own business is one of the toughest tasks to follow through on. So while you may redesign or update your own site, you may never find the time to actually implement it (or find someone who can).

Also, if your website breaks down, every second that passes could potentially translate to foregone income through lost opportunities.

So stop putting it off! Hire a virtual assistant who can maintain your website.

A VA for website management can provide the following services:

Hate looking for stock photography? Got a ton of images to resize / rename?

Or maybe you just need someone to organize your project file structure (and keep it that way) so your project files are always super-easy to use.

A VA for graphic design support can do the following:

Every business needs to make and receive phone calls. Some people just prefer a more personal approach to addressing concerns and issues.

A VA tasked with phone handling can also conduct the following services:

* Never heard back from a client? It’s probably not personal. Read this post about a $5/month tool that earns one company thousands every week.

Keeping all of your clients’ information organized and updated requires work, and often good CRM (customer relations management) software. The same goes for updating project statuses and keeping clients apprised of project progress.

A VA who is entrusted CRM management duties can do the following:

Statistics have shown that businesses that blog generate 53% more traffic than businesses that don’t. But not all blogs are created equal.

In addition to blogging, a talented VA for writing can render the following services:

This is where you “put it all together,” especially if you have assembled a team of virtual assistants for specific tasks. A project manager makes sure everything is on schedule and that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.

And that leaves you with a ton of extra time to do the creative work you want and love to do!

For creative entrepreneurs, a virtual assistant is not only a viable, but valuable option to give you more time and space to handle more clients and make more money.

And more than just managing the day-to-day activities of your business, having a virtual assistant will allow you to breathe and realize there is life outside work!
