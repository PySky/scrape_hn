Dow Jones said Friday that hackers breached its system and possibly stole payment information for some former and current subscribers.

The News Corp unit, which includes The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch, said the data theft may only have involved fewer than 3,500 people. The system was breached between August 2012 and July 2015, according to the company's wire service.|||
