Ten of the brightest Information Communication Technology (ICT) university students in Uganda will be sent to China for skills transfer. This will be done in partnership with Huawei Technologies.

According to Stanley Chyn, Managing Director of Huawei Technologies Uganda, the whole project is targeted at bridging the digital divide.

The 10 successful students to be selected will be the second group from Uganda to be sent to China as part of Huawei's Seeds for the Future program.

Frank Tumwebaze, Uganda’s minister of ICT and National Guidance, said that with help from China, Uganda has been able to construct the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure, a fibre optic cable installation project by Huawei in Uganda.

"“I thank Huawei for the great contribution to the ICT sector. Seeds for the Future program helps cultivate and pool together ICT professionals and students that are crucial to industry development, thus boosting ICT industry growth, driving the development of different sectors and contributing to lower unemployment rates over the long term. To the beneficiary students, please don’t take such opportunities lightly but rather maximize them to become better by gathering useful experiences’’ said Tumwebaze.|||
