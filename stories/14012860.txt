This is a continuation of Building a start-up from scratch Pt 1 : Identifying the problem. In part two of the series I will talk on how I went about designing the solution. Make sure you follow Hackernoon and me (Febin John James), so that you won’t miss later part of the series. Recap: I decided to write about my start-up while I build it. Last week, I identified the problem of the high cost involved in product development. I decided to make a tool that can help non tech entrepreneurs launch their product with a few clicks. To begin with I am focusing on services business. I designed the solution by working backwards. I first made the prototype of the deliverable that I should give a user. Say, Joy wanted to start a laundry business called Joywash. Here’s what my tool should deliver.

So yes, I am generating an app that can help his users signup and make orders. Also a web portal where he can handle the orders. Now , here is how my solution would look like.

All the services business have the same template. They have signup, login, make orders and track orders. You can use this tool to customize the app to your needs like changing the logo, add/remove user input fields etc. I kept it minimal because the idea is to launch it fast . Later, improve the solution based on customer feedbacks. For now there is only one template. But, later there will be a store where developers can sell their templates. I will discuss more about this in the later series. By next week the product should be ready, so stay tuned. See you next week 👋🏻 You can expect the next part of the series a week from now. You can also join the mailing list here. I will use this to notify you about more stories, beta invite, etc. Here is my email jamesfebin@gmail.com for private messages.
