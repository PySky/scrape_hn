UberData inserts text and images into selected layers. You can select several layers at once, and the data puts in the correct order.

You need to select the text layer to insert text. The new text replaces the old one or it is added to the old text if you click on with the Shift key pressed.

If you want to insert an image, you must select a shape layer (vector layer with a color fill). The image covers the selected shape as a smart object. Its size changed to the shape’s size and the image overlaid as a clipping mask.

UberData can take data from *.txt files, but every element in the file must begin with a new line.

You can add a folder with images from your computer. UberData searches for all files, including subfolders.

For example, UberData already includes a free set of 100 avatars.|||
