To ensure that you can do the following:

This is a totally optional step and you should add only if you have issues when prompting for an update.

Your test needs to be a fixture test in order for the matcher to have access to an implicit and properly generate snapshots.

The output of the first run of this test will output two snapshot files under

Containing and respectively

Often on your tests one of your expectations will stop complying with the currently saved snapshot. This means that either the cod is not working as expected or the new output is the correct one.

When running your tests locally, you will be prompted to update the snapshot as soon as one of those expectations fails. Choosing you generate failed results and choosing yes you will have a good result with your updated snapshot.

You can choose how your data should be serialized byt defining an implicit

This can be a way to handle non deterministic fields like and

There is another project to give the ability to work with PlayJson. You can add like below:

To use it just extend your test with as well as

You can use it the same way as before but now the snapshot will be stored as a pretty json.

This extensions comes with another matcher to facilitate deserialization. You can do this by giving the an Id by using and then checking the deserialization with|||
