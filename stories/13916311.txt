Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said he has high hopes for the next steps at his company â€” including transforming the way people travel.

"It feels like there's a pretty big revolution coming there," Chesky said, referring to the airline industry, during an interview on Sunday TODAY .

Although Chesky said he had nothing specific planned so far for shaking up the airline industry, he said future endeavors would involve making air travel a "seamless and frictionless" experience for people.

"In my lifetime, for sure, there's going to be a completely different way to travel," he said.

In December, Airbnb introduced an initiative called Flights , a project that will help people book air travel.|||
