We started Crowdcast because we believe in the power of technology to bring people closer together in powerful new ways. We also believe that standing up for freedom and equality is not just the work of individuals. It is the duty of anyone with a voice, and this includes companies and organizations.

That’s why I am proud to announce our Activist Program.

That means that you can use our live video platform to gather your community, hold rallies, town hall meetings and more at scale. Unlike in-person events, there are no room limits on the internet or Crowdcast.

We love the diversity of events on Crowdcast and are motivated by the amazing knowledge our hosts share. We also recognize that now more than ever, we as a company are in a unique position to amplify the voices of those fighting for fairness, tolerance and unity by making our platform more accessible. Moments like Standing rock have shown that live-streaming is becoming a tool to disseminate knowledge directly and freely.

If you are interested in our program, please apply here and tell us a little about yourself and your work — and share this letter with anyone you think may be interested.

To showcase some of the inspiring activism on Crowdcast, we’re hosting a special event on April 4th on how to create a movement through live online events featuring some of our amazing hosts. Join the conversation below.
