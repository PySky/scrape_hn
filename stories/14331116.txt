The national religion of Norway—the Evangelical Lutheran Church—lost a staggering 15,000 of its flock in just four days, after a one-click-away function was added to its website allowing members to unsubscribe from the religion.

Data housekeeping seemingly backfired when a recently launched Web page prompted 10,854 people to walk away in the space of 24 hours. Within days, a further 5,000 members had left the church, according to the Local. It's not all bad news, though. Despite the hefty exodus, the church's website notes that 549 people used the online form to join its ranks.

The church's council director Jens-Petter Johnsen said the high numbers on the first day showed that many people had already decided to quit. “Although it has never been difficult to opt out of the church, many have failed to submit withdrawal forms or correct errors in the registry. This self-service solution makes it easier to withdraw,” he added.

“We will continue to be the people’s church, open and welcoming, but no one should be a member against his will and so I'm happy that this self-service option is available,” said church spokesman Kristin Gunleiksrud.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church—which claims 3.8 million souls—was Norway's official religion until 2012 and is currently disentangling itself from the state.|||
