In the world of Apple and technology in general, everything that appeals to our nostalgia is welcome.

That’s why if ColorWare takes out a limited edition iPhone 7 Plus with a retro look we’re thrilled, although it costs much more than a normal iPhone 7 Plus.

That’s why, if there is now a skin for the MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro that looks the same, we can not let it pass.

SlickWraps has just released its latest case/skin for the MacBook, and whether you like Apple or not, is right on how to recreate a Mac from the eighties.

It is a beige case that has on its sides small rectangles darkened to simulate the grids of an old Mac. In the center, we find the already more classic Apple with the six colors.

For just $ 29.95, this case allows us to change the look of our Mac as well as protect it against scratches.

The case is available for most Apple laptops, from the 12-inch MacBook to the 15-inch MacBook with Touch Bar, and yes, also for the MacBook Air.

It is not the first time that SlickWraps does something like that, a few weeks ago we saw how they launched a series of very similar cases even for iPhone.

Of course, in this case, the price rises to 36.99 dollars, although we are not before a simple sticker but before a housing itself.|||
