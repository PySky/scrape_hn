After doing Ubuntu flavours RAM consumption comparison, I decided to test other popular distros too.

Tests were performed in a virtual machine with 1GB RAM and repeated 7 times for each distro, each time VM was restarted.

In each test two RAM measurements were made:

All distros were 64-bit, and were fully upgraded after installation (except Solus, which won't work properly after upgrading).

Data was pulled from output, specifically it's sum of RAM and swap (if any) from column (more info). Raw and output for each measurement, prepare and measure scripts, etc: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-sCqfnhKgTLcktXSlBUSi1Cb3c/view?usp=sharing|||

## TL;DR: **Top 5 lightweight distros** / **flavours:** (system, Firefox, file manager and terminal emulator launched) 1. **[Debian] 9 [XFCE]**...
