I found out about the book thanks to someone who mentioned it  on Twitter. It took me several months before I decided to buy a copy, but after my first read through it, I knew that “The Customer Support Handbook” was the missing manual I’ve been looking for. It’s well-written, it’s funny, and  covers many practical scenarios.

The book is divided into three parts: Essays, Best Practices and Quick References.

Essays were written by guests who are the leaders of great customer support teams like UserVoice or Wista. You will get interesting insight into customer experience in this part. Best Practices part gives you a guide on how to handle cases of feature requests, social support, refunds and more. It’s full of practical stuff. Quick References contains snippets of do’s and don’ts. It’s a manual of exactly what you should do when a certain situation occurs.

I decided to choose 10 quotes on customer service and share them with you. I believe, that many of them will resonate with you:

Did you find these quotes on customer service inspiring as well? The Customer Support Handbook is definitely a must-read for anyone who deals with customers and CEOs who are trying to create an exceptional customer experience. If you don’t have a copy yet, go ahead and check it out here.|||
