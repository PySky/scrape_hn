Sync is hard, and conflict resolution can be even harder. In most applications, where the server is the powerhouse responsible for all data logic (read: where the server owner can read your private data), conflict resolution is manageable and transparent. In our case, where notes and tags are encrypted on the app-side, and the server can't read your data, the server can't always make its own decisions as how to handle conflicts.

In Standard Notes, a conflict occurs when you try to make changes to a note before pulling in existing changes that may exist on the server for that note. Since the server can't read your data and determine if the contents are the same, it can't automatically decide to delete one and keep the other. Instead, it automatically makes keeps a copy of both versions of the note, and sends them back to your app.

The philosophy behind Standard Notes and Standard File is that client applications should be smart, if not smarter, than the server side. That's the only way to meaningful end-to-end encryption.

In previous versions of Standard Notes, the conflicted copy of the note would just appear in your list and you'd have to fend for yourself. In the newest version (available on Web now and Desktop later this week), the Standard Notes app will decrypt both versions of the note and compare their contents. If they are similar, the conflicted copy will be automatically deleted. If they are different, then you'll see a nice "Conflicted copy" text in bold red, and you can then decide which version you'd like to keep.
