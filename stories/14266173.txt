Lyle Bickley, of the PDP-1 restoration team, gives us a tour of this amazing, early scientific interactive computer. The first machine built by DEC in 1959, it features a superb graphics screen. DEC gave one to MIT, and some very bright students went wild. Gems such as Spacewar!, Snowflake, 4-voice music programs were all developed by moonlighting MIT students, unencumbered by its measly 12kW memory and pokey 100,000 instructions per second. Along with much more serious debugging and programming languages of course. 

And if you can, come and see this machine for yourself at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California:
