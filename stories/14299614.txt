I started with Service Provider based SSO for SAML. Since the user had to enter his email before proceeding with the login, a state variable was initiated and passed on to the SSO. It comes back through the callback URL and hence was check again for the sanity purpose. It protected against CSRF attacks.

Now IdP initiated SSO doesn't allow me to set state variable at all. Login starts at Identity Provider and only an auth token is provided to the app. I do not know which user is authenticating from the beginning. If I remove the state variable check, it could trigger a CSRF attack as well.

I am also using in which makes state variable a compulsory param and SSO provider is .

What is the way to attach state variable to IdP initiated SSO solutions?|||
