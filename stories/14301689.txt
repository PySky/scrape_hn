Our weekly series What The Heck Is… exists to shed light on the strange unexplained acronyms and unfamiliar buzzwords that creep into our everyday lives.

From ‘copreneurs’ to ‘teledildonics’ we’re on a mission to explain the difficult to explain.

Now, as we start fantasising about sunshine, we’re dreaming of hot days and cool beverages.

‘Nitro coffee’ sounds like a crazy science experiment – but it’s going to give your coffee a boost this summer…

It’s easiest to think of nitro coffee as the beautiful bastard child of coffee and beer. It’s made from steeped cold brew coffee, but comes in a keg, and is poured on tap using a beer pump in cafes or bars.

You can also get tinned versions.

Nitro coffee is a little crisper and sweeter. It’s also creamier than ever – even black coffee comes out with an impressive Guinness-like head.

Chilled coffee with ‘champagne bubbles’ might sound bizarre, but it’d fast becoming a global (caffeine) hit.|||
