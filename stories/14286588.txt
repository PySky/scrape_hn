This project provides a small library for working with virtual clocks which can be used for tracking the passage of virtualized time. Clocks can be started and stopped, the rate at which time flows can be altered and even be made negative, causing time to flow backwards. Time can be limited by a minimum and maximum value, and when both a minimum and maximum are defined time may be set to loop around. Time listeners may be attached which will fire when a given (absolute) time on the clock is passed.

differs from other libraries by using high resolution time data to calculate its current clock time, independent of system clock drift (which might be adjusted manually or skewed by software like NTP). Apart from the time listeners functionality it doesn't use any form of timers, instead calculating the current clock time whenever it is requested. The library is optimized for performance, has extensive test coverage for all functionality and edge cases, and is fully compatible with both browser and Node.js environments.|||
