The Haxe Summit 2017 is a four day conference for Haxe professionals to connect with one another as well as the authors of the tools they are actively using or considering to add to their toolchain.

We are putting together a schedule with two separate tracks for game and web development. It will be packed with hands on tutorials and workshop, panel discussions covering various aspects of Haxe and of course a wide selection of talks to improve visibility of all the things going on within Haxe's busy ecosystem.|||
