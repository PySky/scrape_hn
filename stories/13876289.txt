This repository contains the text for the Tiny Python 3.6 Notebook.

Warning, this is not an introduction to Python. Rather it is a notebook containing curated examples for Python 3 as well as the new features found in Python 3.6. It is designed to accompany technical corporate training offered by the author or aid those who want a quick refresher to the Python syntax.

If you are interested in purchasing larger amounts (100+) for schools, employees or for use as giveaways/swag at a conference (much better than a tshirt!), get in touch with Matt (matt at metasnake dot com).

If you enjoy this content, consider purchasing the physical version. It is a hand laid out version that fits in the pocket and has blank pages in the back for note taking. It is available at Amazon. I'm indebted to those who support my work and write reviews. Thanks!

Feel free to share this repository on social media.

The author is human and will certainly make errors. You may file a bug and it may be resolved in a future version of the book. I love feedback and would love to hear your ideas on what is missing or could be improved.

This book covers the syntax in Python up to version 3.6.
