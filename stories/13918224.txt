There is a wide range of folding and unfolding problems, some going back several centuries and still unsolved, like unfolding convex polyhedra, while others are more recent like protein folding. In the last few years, there has been tremendous progress on many of the fundamental problems in folding and unfolding, yet some of the most important questions still remain open. This leaves the area in an exciting state.

Many results in folding and unfolding can be characterized in the following way. My favorite type of results are universality results which prove that, in a certain model of folding, everything is possible. These results are usually the most surprising. Typically they come with an efficient algorithm for finding the folding; pure existential proofs are rare. If we cannot hope to fold everything, the next best thing is to have an efficient (polynomial) algorithm, both for detecting whether an object is foldable, and if so, for finding an efficient folding. Sometimes even this is impossible: a hardness result proves that even deciding whether an object is foldable in a particular way is computationally intractable.

The basic constraints in folding a piece of paper are that the paper is folded continuously (no ripping), while preserving distances along its surface (no stretching), and not causing the paper to self-intersect (no crossing).|||
