We are launching an online suitcase business. You might be wondering what we mean by "folding suitcase" and how it could actually improve the way you travel. Here is the answer : 

Our suitcase is composed by a solid structure that can be folded (in the same way as an accordion). A prototype version is shown below.

We actually found out that many travelers face problems to fit all their purchases in their suitcase when they come home after their holidays. We want therefore to help them to dispose of extra luggage space when they need it.

Answering the questions below could help us a lot. Thanks,|||
