JavaScript has grown in popularity because of its portability, standardization, and speed. While its primary use is in client-side web applications, JavaScript is not limited to running in the browser and is truly a general-purpose language. Today, it is possible to compile other languages (including C/C++) into JavaScript, and even run an entire virtual machine emulator in the browser that can run any operating system. JavaScript is an ideal language for building complex and interactive user interfaces, and it’s particularly suitable for scientific data visualization.

This special issue will present original research on computational science applications and systems that use JavaScript as the primary programming language. We are particularly interested in papers that emphasize the advantages of JavaScript over other programming languages, as well as those that discuss novel JavaScript libraries of interest to scientists and engineers. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
