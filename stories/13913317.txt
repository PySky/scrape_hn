AUSTIN, Texasâ€”We at Ars have woken from a taco-and-barbecued induced haze and managed to survive our largest outing to date at the annual South by Southwest conference. The event wraps this weekend after 10 packed days (loosely) defined by tech, policy, film, gaming, and entertainment. If you haven't attended recently, it's a radically different event even from a few years ago.

On the conference's 30th anniversary, in fact, SXSW CPO Hugh Forrest kicked everything off by showing the event's original program from 1987. Want a microcosm of the festival's evolution? Forrest planned (and designed that pamphlet) all on his Mac+. Today, he says it now takes nine months of planning/prep so the conference can both function and add new wrinkles, like its app chatbot, Abby.

The results of all that hard work means at one moment you can demo a smart jacket and in the next you can be chatting up Bill Nye. Films about Kim Dotcom run alongside panels diving into the details of the Stranger Things soundtrack. And, despite SXSW's newly vaster reach, it still attracts top mind and figures like former Vice President Joe Biden (talking about his ongoing cancer research initiatives).

However SXSW evolves next, expect it to continue offering the weird and wonderful side-by-side. And as long as that happens, we'll happily investigate in-between debates over migas or brisket.|||

Look at the event that somehow puts Joe Biden and Stranger Things on the same schedule.
