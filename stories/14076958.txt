The rollout of Android Wear 2.0 to older devices was delayed last month after Google found a bug in the software. Now, though, it seems whatever was causing the hold-up has been fixed, with the update hitting a bunch of new devices.

LG said in a post on Google+ that the LG G Watch R and Watch Urbane will both “start” updating to Android Wear 2.0 this week, with the Watch Urbane 2nd edition following suit “in the beginning of May.” New Balance also says that its RunIQ smartwatch will get the update “no later than April 14th.”

That’s good news for owners of these smartwatches, who will soon get the benefit of Google’s latest wearable software. The 2.0 update offers a number of new features, including a simpler UI for better navigation; watchface customizations accessible on the watch itself; third-party complications; Google’s AI Assistant; and the long-overdue ability to download standalone apps. New Balance also says the update will mean better GPS acquisition and battery life.|||
