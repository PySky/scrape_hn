Creating art through augmented reality represents something that I’ve always imagined doing—but never had the tools to try. Since I was a kid, I’ve imagined marks that moved. I imagined taking colors from around the city and making marks on buildings, streets, houses, signs and fire hydrants. These marks had a rhythm and pulse. I imagined them leaping off walls and following me around—tripping over themselves to stain the sidewalk by my apartment, bouncing off my bathroom walls as I brushed my teeth—they made the entire experience of living a work of art.

Augmented reality makes this possible. It merges tech and art to create new opportunities, new possibilities. For the first time, someone in tech may be considering how to enrich a project through an artist’s work. And artists can begin to imagine how tech can take their work to another dimension—literally. This is how I want to challenge the future of art.

Taking augmented reality as a new medium, we can challenge the definition of making and experiencing art. What will a museum visit be like in the future? Or going to a gallery? What will being an artist look like? My experience with Facebook allows me to begin answering these questions. But it poses so many others.

Special thanks to the talented Facebook team I had the great privilege to work with : Kristen Spilman, Andrea Ho, John Barnett, Andreas Berner, and Joshua C Harris.
