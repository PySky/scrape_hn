Description: If your page is really long, visitors can feel like they're in a never ending tunnel as they scroll the page. Well, this compact jQuery script adds a sleek progress bar to either the top or bottom of the page to give your visitors a better sense of how far they are along the page as they scroll up and down.Â  As a bonus, clicking on the progress bar takes the user to the position on the page where the user clicked.

CSS3 3D transform is used to animate the progress bar to maximize performance. As such the script works only in modern browsers, with IE9 and below seeing nothing.

Demo: Scroll the page and look at the bottom of the window to see the progress bar.
