Twitter has over last decade become one of the most popular media for getting latest up to date information on a variety of topics. Software engineering community is also very active on Twitter. There already has been exploratory research on How developers stay updating using Twitter, What developers micro-blog about, What are the popular topics/events among software developers on Twitter which shows that Twitter is quite popular among software developers.

However in recent years with the huge volume of tweets and information that is produced on Twitter, it has become harder for people to make sense of the large amount of information that developers (or anyone in general) get exposed to. Our research group in currently interested in exploring techniques which can make more sense of the huge data related to software development that is produced on Twitter.

In one of our current project, we are interested in knowing what types of accounts do developers like to follow on Twitter in order to aid their software development activities. In order to understand what developers follow on Twitter we are currently conducting a survey Who would you like to follow on Twitter?. The goal of the survey is to understand or come up with some broad categories of accounts which developers follow on Twitter. Based on the responses we get in this survey we will qualitatively analyze the responses to develop the most popular categories that software developers are interested.

Thank you for the support!! Please also help spread the word by sharing or liking:)

P.S: The survey is completely anonymous and no personally identifiable information is collected. The survey should not take more than 10 minutes. The summarized results of the survey will be shared on Twitter account @Juggernaut9NITH.|||
