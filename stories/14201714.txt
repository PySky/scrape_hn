In this part, we will replace the existing localForage storage implementation with Firebase. This will make our application persistent between devices.

Here is what we will do:

More information about these technologies is available on the Firebase’s site.

Part 1: Setup Ionic 2 Application and Take Photos with a Native Camera

Part 3: Use Location Plugins to Add Coordinates for Every Photo Taken and Place Your Images on Google Maps

Part 4: Change the Persistence Layer with Firebase, and Make a Real-time Application (This post!)

We need to sign in to the Firebase webpage with our Google account.

When it’s done, go to the developer console.

We need to make a new project for our application. There is a nice button saying “Add project.” Click it.

A modal window will pop up and ask you to type in the name of your project. You can type in what you want, or you can import Google project to Firebase (which was created before the Maps API), so I will import this project.

To create a new project, you need to select your region. After you have chosen one, click on the “Create project” button.|||
