Passwords are inherently insecure. It’s more than likely that you use the same password for several different services. If you’re really on top of things, you might use a password manager to generate and remember passwords for you. Even then, the password manager service is at risk of being hacked and your passwords being stolen. Bugs happen that can leave you vulnerable.

What is the solution?

I present to you the Passwordless method!

There are several benefits to this method. First of all, the worst possible security breach only affects you on the service where the breach occurred. Secondly, this method forces a sort of pseudo two-factor authentication workflow—even for services that don’t support it. Finally, it’s quicker and easier to use than a password manager.|||
