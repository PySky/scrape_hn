This article is about a Ghanaian phenomenon. For the town in Japan, see Sakawa, K≈çchi

Sakawa is Ghanaian term for illegal practices which combine modern Internet-based fraud with religious rituals.[1] The rituals, which are mostly in the form of sacrifices, are intended to spiritually manipulate victims so that the scammer's fraud is successful. The term Sakawa initially referred to specific online scams but has since broadened to include all types of online frauds and scams mainly targeting foreigners. The scammers flaunt stylish clothes, luxury cars, and enormous wealth, in order to promote this act. In impoverished areas, it can be seen as a way of survival for some.[2][3][4][5][6]|||
