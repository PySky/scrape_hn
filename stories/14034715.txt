The following quote is from Alfred Korzybski's Science and Sanity. The text that introduced the field of General Semantics. The book is notoriously difficult to read due to Korzybski's dense and technical prose, so I've edited the exerpt for brevity.

Setting aside the specific problems he is referring to, related to non-aristotelian systems, I think this is an interesting characterization of what it is like to read something of which you know little about. When you read something meant for specialists of some kind, the authors are often concerned with problems that you have never encountered and have no experience to contextualize, yet it does create the feeling that such problems do exist. Perhaps it is this expanding awareness of the range of problems that leads to wisdom. When faced with the range of problems, one can't help but realize the limitations of their own mind. Perhaps it is this experience which leads to the 'discovery of ignorance' so important in the development of a sound mind.1

An exercise we would all benefit from on occasion is to generate a series of questions that we haven't the slightest idea how to answer. On a regular basis we ought to discover our ignorance. It keeps us sharp.

Think about the mechanics of something you experience everyday but seldom if ever think about.

You need not spend all day pondering such questions. Simply recognizing that such problems do exist is enough to improve the quality of your thinking.

Notes: 

 1. The "Discovery of Ignorance" is a phrase introduced by Yuval Noah Harari in his acclaimed work Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. It refers to the discovery that launched the scientific revolution, the discovery that we don't know the answers to most of our questions. Prior to this a great deal of things were explained with fake explanations.|||
