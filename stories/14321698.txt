There are so many bingo sites and online bingo games out there that, at first glance and if you’re new to online bingo, it’s impossible to work out which is the best and which is not for you. Of course all the adverts say they’re the best or the highest rated, but they are not necessarily reflecting what you want to get out of your online bingo experience.

We’ve had a look at some of the most popular and well known bingo sites across the UK and the US and come up with a list that we think is accurate in helping you choose the best site for you. We’ve included information on whether there are free to play options and whether they include a welcome bonus. This should help you decide the best online bingo games for you to try – although it’s often down to the community aspect of the site as well so you may need to try a few before you find one you’re most comfortable with interacting with other players.

This site has grown its players base since it launched in 2013 from the UK and now includes Europe, Australia and Canada. The site offers knockout bingo rooms, as well as 90 ball and 75 ball.
