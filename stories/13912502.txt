Recommender systems (or recommendation engines) are useful and interesting pieces of software. I wanted to compare recommender systems to each other but could not find a decent list, so here is the one I created. Please help me keep this post up-to-date by submitting corrections and additions via pull-request, or tweet me @grahamjenson.

SaaS Recommender systems have many challenges to their development including having to handle multi-tenancy, store and process a massive amount of data and other softer concerns like keeping a clients sensitive data safe on remote servers.

The benefits to using a SaaS recommender system is that you can pay for value with a low overhead rather than having a large upfront investment, they generally have a clear integration path for you to use, and they provide continual development and improvement while you use it.

Most of the non-SaaS recommender systems that are open-source. This may have been because recommender systems are more tailored to clients so not easily made into a product.

Not very many Non-SaaS Non-OpenSource recommender systems seem to exist. Below is a list:

Recommender systems are a very active area of research in academia, though few of the generated systems make it out of the lab. Here are a few I have found that did:

It is very difficult to benchmark recommender systems, not only because getting good datasets is hard, but different methods and algorithms have different advantages and disadvantages that are difficult to expose.

Here is a list of some benchmarking tools:

In addition to generic recommender systems, I decided to add a list of applications where recommendations are a core offering, specifically in the domain of media recommendations:|||
