At Lambda Days 2017 David will talk about some of the history of functional programming languages and how it reflects what are still live issues of language design.



Topics will include:

* the advantages and disadvantages of lazy evaluation 

* run time typing (as in Erlang) versus static typing (as in Haskell)|||
