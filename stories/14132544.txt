Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix operating systems. The current stable public release version is 1.8.2. For more information, see the following:

Though written from scratch, Mutt's initial interface was based largely on the ELM mail client. To a large extent, Mutt is still very ELM-like in presentation of information in menus (and in fact, ELM users will find it quite painless to switch as the default key bindings are identical). As development progressed, features found in other popular clients such as PINE and MUSH have been added, the result being a hybrid, or "mutt." At present, it most closely resembles the SLRN news client. Mutt was originally written by Michael Elkins but is now developed and maintained by the members of the Mutt development mailing list.
