 The Android-x86 project is glad to announce 5.1-rc1 release to public. This is the first release candidate for Android-x86 5.1 (lollipop-x86) stable release. The prebuilt images are available in the following site: 

 The 5.1-rc1 release is based on the Android 5.1.1_r24. We added many x86 specified code and fixed issues to let the system runs smoothly on x86 platforms, especially for netbooks or tablets. The key features contain Supports 64-bit kernel and userspace, as well as 32-bit system. Support booting from UEFI and installing to UEFI disk. Be able to install to ext4/ext3/ext2/ntfs/fat32 filesystems via a text based GUI installer. We create universal images for most x86 platforms. This release contains two files. One is the traditional ISO file that can be booted on devices with legacy BIOS. The other is the EFI image that can be used on more modern devices with UEFI firmware. In particular the EFI image is a 64-bit (x86_64) system. You can choose one of them depends on your devices. In doubt, try the ISO file first. Both files can be dumped into a usb drive to create a bootable usb stick like where is the device name of your usb drive. Suspend and resume doesn't work on some devices. The source code is available in the main git server,
