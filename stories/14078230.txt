SEACOM is currently experiencing a "service-affecting outage" on their marine system between Mombasa and Zafarana. The undersea cable company has said that the marine fault is located slightly west of Djibouti in the Red Sea and occurred on the 8th of April 2017 21:00 Central African Time.

"The impact of the incident is that all linear transmission traffic on the east coast of Africa to and from Europe will be affected. Customers with IP or other managed network services will remain unaffected but could experience higher latencies with possible degradation of service, as traffic will predominantly be routed over SEACOM’s WACs transmission links on the west coast of Africa, as well as on SEACOM’s network to Asia gateways." said SEACOM in a statement.

The undersea cable company also mentioned that their repair vessel is being mobilized and a tentative repair date will be confirmed soon.|||
