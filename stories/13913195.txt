A Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a â€˜search keyâ€™) and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

Below image shows order in which the nodes are expanded in BFS â€“

Below is the list of commonly asked interview questions that can be solved using BFS â€“
