High-Tech Bridge provides you with a free API to test your SSL/TLS servers. To assure high speed of service and availability for everyone, the free API allows 20 requests in 3 minutes, 250 requests in total per 24 hours, from one IP address.



 In order to prevent abuse, a protection mechanism has been set up to remove the ability to test IPs that are not related to tested domain name. As a consequence if a domain name is resolved into several IPs, a second request will be mandatory, specifying one of the IPs replied by the server along with the token issued (examples are below). However, if the tested domain name can be resolved into only one IP address, it will be immediately tested.



 License notice: The API is provided for free both for private and commercial purposes. If you use the API for publicly available service (commercial or not) a link to High-Tech Bridge's Free SSL Server Test is mandatory.

The full version of the API documentation and how-to is available here. Below you can find a brief summary of the documentation.|||
