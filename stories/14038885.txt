Apple legal battle back in 2012. As he's been working alongside Ive for many years, Stringer has had a hand in designing everything from the iPhone and iPad to the Mac over the last 20 years.Ive's industrial design team is notoriously private, so little else is known about Stringer, or where he might be going after Apple.
