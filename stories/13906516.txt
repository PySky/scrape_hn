The 13th session of the LASER summer school covers the fascinating topic of software for robotics. Robots are everywhere, with an ever-increasing potential for helping humans achieve their goals. Software is a fundamental part of modern robotics systems; LASER brings together top international experts in the field, who will share their knowledge of robotics software and insights on outstanding research challenges.

The school is intended for professionals from the industry (engineers and managers) as well as university researchers, including PhD students. The school’s focus is applied, although theory is welcome to establish solid foundations. The format of the school favors extensive interaction between participants and speakers.

Like its predecessors, the 2017 LASER summer school takes place in the idyllic setting of the Elba Island off the coast of Tuscany, easily reachable by air, car, bus or train.

The school location is the magnificent Hotel del Golfo in the Gulf of Procchio, Elba. Along with an intensive scientific program, participants will have time to enjoy the natural and cultural riches of this history-laden jewel of the Mediterranean.|||
