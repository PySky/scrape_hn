Odd Lots: Here Are the Signs That a Civilization Is About to Collapse

Every week, hosts Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway take you on a not-so-random walk through hot topics in markets, finance, and economics.

Mayan Civilization. The Roman Empire. Aztecs, Incans and Etruscans. All great civilizations eventually collapse. So what are the signs of their demise?

On the latest edition of the Odd Lots podcast, we speak with Arthur Demarest, a professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in the end of civilizations. An anthropologist and archaeologist who's most well known for his work on the Mayans, Demarest tells us about what he's learned — and what we should be watching out for.|||

The end is nigh.
