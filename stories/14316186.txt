Maybe you can help me? My gut tells me that virtual reality or even mixed reality can be useful for teaching computer science. How to do that is the question. I don’t want it to be just another device that students program. That’s not really innovative. I want to think of ways that help students learn computer science. I want them to “see” things that can not ordinarily be seen.

My first thought was a virtual tour of a computer. While I do show students mother boards and other pieces of computers wouldn’t a “walk through” of a virtual computer be better? More interesting? On one hand a video, perhaps just an animation, can do that fairly well. On the other hand virtual reality is the opportunity to take different paths through the computer to trace things the way a student would like. A mixed reality tool would label items as a student looked at a physical device. Taking the tour would be more fun though.

How about following instructions as data through the pipeline in a CPU? That could be fun and make things more real to students. In fact a general walk through a CPU could be good. The improvement over a simple video would be the ability to travel non linearly. IS that enough? I’d like to find out.

How would virtually tracing the path of code in a program work? Could we set things up so a student could follow (visually) a variable through code to see what happens to it? Perhaps watching the variables as they appear (are instantiated) and disappear (as their scope expires)? The idea of being mixed in with the code ala TRON or The Matrix has a certain appeal to me.

Do these ideas make sense to people? Would they help? Do you have other ideas?  Is this even possible with current technology? Putting this together probably requires some talent, time, and even money. Who will do it first?|||
