What is a record? A record is a row of data that is collected/scraped from a website source. It is then made downloadable as spreadsheets or API.

What is a report? Report is set of records (dataset) over time. You can run a report on specific intervals (or on demand) to extract new and fresh data from the initial source and store it as either new report or replace the previous report. There are plan level limits in place for the number of reports you can create.

What are record credits? Record credits are additional records you can purchase on top of your plan's allowed limit. If you exceed your limits on the plan, but need to collect more records, you can buy credits for those records without upgrading the plan.

How does the free plan work? Free or Lite plan does impose a few limits on the software, like the maximum number of records fetched per crawl. Otherwise, you get the full experience of the depth and breadth of the Grepsr platform, so you know exactly what you're getting when you become a paid user.

Will the tool work on all websites? Grepsr smart extractor recognizes patterns in web content (html tags) for tagging the data, therefore the target website need to be well structured for the point n' click toolkit to accurately select and extract the data you need.
