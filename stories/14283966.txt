Random (formerly Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics) is a website devoted to probability, mathematical statistics, and stochastic processes, and is intended for teachers and students of these subjects. The site consists of an integrated set of components that includes expository text, interactive web apps, data sets, biographical sketches, and an object library. Please read the Introduction for more information about the content, structure, mathematical prerequisites, technologies, and organization of the project. Random is hosted at two sites: www.math.uah.edu/stat/ and www.randomservices.org/stat/. For updates, please follow @randomservices on Twitter.

This site uses a number of advanced (but open and standard) technologies, including HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. To use this project properly, you will need a modern browser that supports these technologies. The latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari are the best choices. The Internet Explorer and Edge browsers for Windows do not fully support the technologies used in this project.

Display of mathematical notation is handled by the open source MathJax project.

This project was partially supported by a two grants from the Course and Curriculum Development Program of the National Science Foundation (award numbers DUE-9652870 and DUE-0089377). This project is also partially supported by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Please see the support and credits page for additional information.
