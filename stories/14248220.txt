One of South Africa's Internet of Things (IoT) technology companies, IoT.nxt, will be opening its first office in Europe in The Netherlands. The office will officially be up and running in July 2017.

“The company participated in large scale IoT conferences and expos in London (IoT Tech Expo in January and SMART IoT held in March) where it was evident that there is significant interest in Europe for IoT.nxt’s innovative approach to offering companies new strategic solutions to deliver efficiencies and significant cost savings through the implementation of IoT technology. The office currently being set up in The Hague will allow us easy access to the European market,” said Dr Joe Bester, IoT.nxt Marketing Director, who will lead the new office in The Netherlands.

Earlier in January 2017 the innovative South African IoT company opened what they call an "associate office" in London.

“The Netherlands has a strong technology focus and was the logical choice,” added Bester.

IoT.nxt has an "edge to cloud technology agnostic IoT platform" that enables rapid IoT implementation. The company say that their platform allows for "a top down or bottom up digital transformation approach and is an enabling technology for all of the large IoT platform and big data players, as is evidenced through the company’s many commercial applications across many industry verticals where customers were using MS, SAP, IBM or GE, to name a few."

Bester further explained that one of the main reasons for setting up the office is that The Netherlands legislation is business-friendly and especially favourable towards technology startups. “The Netherlands was by far the best choice for us as a next step after our first successful international expansion with our London office.”|||
