Just wanted to share our deployment strategy for us here at muchbetteradventures.com, to see if anyone had any better ideas, or just may be interested in how we do it here.

Right now, we have a single Git repo with our Django app, along with several frontend apps, both jQuery based simple Javascript files, LESS css, and a few Reactjs apps.

We deploy to Heroku using a multi-buildpack containing the node js buildpack and a python one.

Heroku post-deploy scripts do the npm install and build our javascript apps, and then the Python buildpack does it’s `pip install` of the Python/Django stuff.

We then use the Django collectstatic command and AWS Boto commands to push all the built static files to a new S3 bucket named after the commit hash.

We then update some ENV variables to ensure that the app looks for static assets in this new S3 bucket.

We decided to let Heroku do the building of the JS so that we didn’t have builds cluttering up our repo, it also means we can work locally using Javascript hot loader, and not concern ourselves with any build processes.

And that’s it, I don’t think this is THE best way to do things, but it works for us right now, any comments welcome!|||
