I was contacted by JRM & Associates, specifically James. I previously applied on my own with my lender and was denied all 3 times. I even paid over $3500 in retainer fees at a law firm and hired 2 more companies who didnâ€™t do anything for me. When James called and we discussed my financial position, he immediately told me there were options. James assisted me with everything, he just made it easy for me. I was approved, saved over $600/month, and received a permanent loan modification with an principle reduction incentive over the next 3 years! They kept me informed the entire time and communicated on a weekly, sometimes even daily, basis. I HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO REFER JRM & ASSOCIATES INC. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS!|||
