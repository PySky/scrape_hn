Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has announced the availability of an online Visa on Arrival (VOA) facility for those who require VISAs to enter Nigeria. The online facility will allow for VISA applications without having to visit a Nigerian mission office in any country by applying online and the VISA will be issued on arrival upon preof of payment, which the Nigerian Immigration Service stresses can only be made electronically as they will not accept cash.

According to the Comptroller-General of the NIS, Muhammad Babandede, any VOA applications from anywhere in the world will be processed and issued within 48 hours, i.e. two working days.

NIS has also assigned a dedicated e-mail address, [emailÂ protected] , which visa applicants can use to send their requests and details. Alternatively applicants can also apply online.

Babandede further explained that a Visa-On-Arrival designated desk had been allocated at all of Nigeria's international airports where visas would be issued upon the presentation of all the necessary travel documents and proof of visa payment.|||
