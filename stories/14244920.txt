Java is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language initiatedÂ by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, and Mike Sheridan in 1991 and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Java treat everything as an Object. It is based on the Object model so it is easy to extend. OOP methodology simplify the development and maintenance of software. Following are some basic concepts of object oriented programming which will be covered in next chapters.

Java is compiled into platform independent byte code unlike other programming languages which are compiled into platform dependent machine code. The byte code in interpreted by Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is running.

Java is designed to be simple. The syntax of java is based on C++ and with basic concepts of OPP java is easy to learn.

Java enables you to develop secure, virus free and temper free applications with following features.

In Java there is no implementation dependent aspects of the specification.

Java byte code is platform independent and can run on any environment.

Java has a strong memory management system and with no explicit pointers it reduce security problems. Garbage collection, Exception handling and type checking mechanism makes java robust.

Java has multi-threading feature which enables to write programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Threads are separate programs which executes concurrently.

Java has high performance because of its Just-In-Time compilers.

With RMI and EJB Java can be used to create distributed applications.|||

Java is a high-level object-oriented, fast, secure, and reliable programming language which is developed by Sun Microsystems.
