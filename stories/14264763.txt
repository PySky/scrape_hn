You’ve probably driven past wind farming fields, and seen wind turbines from afar. You may have even seen one up-close, and wondered how it all works.

How do wind turbines generate electricity? Where does the electricity go? And what exactly goes into the mechanism to make it all happen? Read on to get your answers.

Did you know that the first wind turbine that could generate electricity was built way back in 1888? At the time, it could generate only 12 KW of power.

Here are a few more interesting facts about wind turbines:

There are several elements that go into the process of wind turbines generating energy from the wind, and then powering up your home.

Let’s take a look at some of the crucial elements:

These are just some of the basics involved in the functioning of a wind turbine. There are plenty more details to cover, including the functions of each part in the turbine.
