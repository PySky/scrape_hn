This project is demonstration of how to invoke an AWS lambda function from python concurrently.

10 simultaneous invocations will run at all times, and everytime a call has resolved, a new call will be created.

Notice how the code seems synchronous and the total lack of explicit concurrency known from libs like asyncio or tornado.|||
