First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Atom and its packages, which are hosted in the Atom Organization on GitHub. If you're unsure which package is causing your problem or if you're having an issue with Atom core, please open an issue on the main atom repository. These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

This is the repository for the core Atom editor only. Atom comes bundled with many packages and themes that are stored in other repos under the Atom organization such as tabs, find-and-replace, language-javascript, and atom-light-ui.

For more information on how to work with Atom's official packages, see Contributing to Atom Packages
