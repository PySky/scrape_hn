We are expanding our team of backend developers and looking for the very best engineers to join us. We currently have 8 engineers but are looking to grow this over the coming months.

We hire for aptitude not knowledge, although we would like to see experience of solving large and complex problems, we are not looking for a list of specific programming languages on your CV.

We are looking for people with a genuine passion for problem solving, coding, and who enjoy being challenged. Most likely you will be interested in machine learning or data science as well. You will be comfortable with prioritising your own work and communicating clearly with your team.

You will joining a highly talented and motivated team building out patented database technology, as we bring it to market.

The tech stack currently comprises Go, Javascript, MySQL, NodeJS, React, Redis, Neo4J, Microservices and Full CI - but we are committed to using the best technology for the task at hand.

The team is self-organising and runs without scrum masters, project managers or formal team leads, relying on regular contact and weekly meetings with the (technical) CEO/Founder. Since we are all physically based at a single site, communication is straightforward.

We were founded in 2015 by Nick Halstead and are funded by some top tier US VCs, who are also invested in Nick’s previous company, DataSift.

We are fundamentally rebuilding how the database works for dealing with consumer information. Fixing security and privacy while allowing independent databases to be queried as if they were combined. We announced our first product, DataJoin, in November 2016. We also launched Databake.io in December 2016 as a side project.

We're based in Basingstoke, which is south west of London, right next to the railway station. Basingstoke has excellent rail links - only 45 mins to Waterloo, and commutable trains to places such as Reading, Oxford, Southampton and Salisbury - or simply drive to the office. If you're thinking of relocating, living in or near Basingstoke is significantly cheaper than London, and several of our team have a 10 minute stroll to work each morning.

Work here, and you will receive a competitive salary (no discount for being out of London), stock options, and private health care. We also have a great office environment with a fully stocked fridge, sugary and non-sugary snacks, Friday team lunches, a pool table, various games consoles including a VR kit, Lego, Nerf Guns and other assorted toys. You’ll get to know your colleagues outside of work at monthly socials and daily at lunch over card or board games if you’re keen.
