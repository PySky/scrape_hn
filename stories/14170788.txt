Well, I’m here to tell you they are! While some of these certifications look good on your resume, others will expand your skillset and vouch for your expertise.

I’ll explain by way of example — 10 of them, to be exact. Note that I’m not including in this post online courses but only instead am focusing on programs that lead to a certification. Plus, the list below does include some free marketing certifications.

Has this post changed your mind about getting a certification? Please let us know in the comments section. All of the sponsors of these certifications just so happen to be connections in DataHero, which means you’ll be able to create richer charts and dashboards here. Fortunately, you don’t need one of these credentials to make your own visualizations — please click here to get started.
