Gloom, a very good Doom clone, was commercially released in 1996 by Black Magic. Being a clone doesn’t take away the quality of the game, and to prove that, Gloom was acclaimed as the 18th best Amiga game of all time by Amiga Power magazine.

Now, 20 years later, the game source code was released on Github, for the delight of any retro programmer out there looking for a cool game to learn from. The game was coded in Assembler with some parts in Blitz Basic 2.

The Github user “earok” adds that the source code was provided “as is”, and he cannot guarantee it is complete. I guess we gonna need to wait until someone brave enough spends some time build it from the sources! Any candidates?|||
