We started Medium in 2012 to create a place for important ideas that deserve to be heard by the world.

Today, the precariousness of our media ecosystem has never been more obvious—nor has our need for depth, truth-seeking, and understanding. It’s time for thoughtfulness to prevail. Together, we can build a new model where contributors are rewarded based on value rather than clicks.

Upgrade today to become a founding member of Medium, and 100% of your contributions will fund new ideas from independent writers and publishers.|||

Together, we’re building a different kind of place on the internet: one designed for you, not for advertisers.
