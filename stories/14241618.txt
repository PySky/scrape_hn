This is the beginning of a series of blog posts on the different entities we at AppFolio use to manage logic in our server-rendered views. Now, much like the rest of the Rails community we too are moving towards more client-rendered views and a more client-server architecture but the majority of pages are still rendered server-side, and that will be the case for many years going forward. In such a setting it therefore still makes sense to discuss how we want to organize the code that renders these server-side views.

In this series we will be doing a deep dive into each of the concepts individually, but to start out I thought it would be good to give an overview of each concept and what we at AppFolio mean by them. There doesn't seem to be a consensus in the Rails community about what terms like “Presenter” mean and where the boundaries of responsibility lie.

I will by no means claim that what we’ve done will work for everyone - but it works well for us, and who knows - it may do the trick for you as well!|||
