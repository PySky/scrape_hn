“Extending our relationship enables us to continue leveraging the company’s extensive expertise in synthesis technology while allowing Microsemi’s engineering resources to focus on supporting the advanced features and capabilities [of] our FPGAs,” said Jim Davis, vice president of software engineering at Microsemi. “Synopsys’ Synplify Pro synthesis software is specifically designed for FPGAs and is well-known as the de facto industry standard for producing high performance, cost-effective designs for these devices.”

“We were pleased to support Microsemi throughout the early access program for PolarFire FPGAs and are proud to be a part of its mid-range FPGA launch,” said Andrew Dauman, vice president of engineering in Synopsys’ Verification Group.|||

Microsemi and Synopsys have signed a multi-year extension of their OEM agreement under which customised FPGA synthesis tools are made available to Microsemi’s customers.
