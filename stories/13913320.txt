I do not want to list the company name here as I am not sure if they use this reddit or not so forgive me if there is some vagueness here.

I have recently managed to secure in interview at a web development company. Their email told me to arrive early for a development related task and quiz.

Now I am panicking slightly. I was hoping that you guys could help me out.

What do you suppose a question will be that they will ask? and what in the tech world should I know about?

I figured if you could all post one Question & Answer. And also one tech tool/resource/news article this would become a great starting place for anyone else looking.|||
