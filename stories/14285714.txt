QuickLaTeX.com is a free web service aimed to help people to include mathematical formulas&graphics into the web pages easily and without sacrificing flexibility and high quality of LaTeX system.

It is based on very simple idea. User feeds QuickLaTeX.com with the piece of LaTeX code. QuickLaTeX renders it to the image stored on the server and returns URL of that image. User inserts URL into web page in place where formula should be. Next time when visitor opens that web page in the browser formula is shown.

This process can be easily automated by means of QuickLaTeX-enabled plugins for your favorite CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc.). We have WP-QuickLaTeX plugin for Wordpress. Please visit math-pages on my blog to check its capabilities.

We welcome any contribution - especially in plugin development for various CMS (blogs, forums, etc).|||
