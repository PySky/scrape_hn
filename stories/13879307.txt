“The email sent to Taylor was wrong and does not represent our team’s approach or values,” co-founder Joshua Simair said in a statement shared with BuzzFeed Canada.

“We are very disappointed in how it was handled. We do share a compensation package prior to hiring. As soon as we became aware of it on Monday, we reached out to Taylor to apologize for the email and reschedule her interview.”

Simair also said the company will provide staff with more training to avoid similar situations in the future.

SkipTheDishes was founded in Saskatoon in 2013 and is headquartered in Winnipeg. Its food ordering service is available in cities across North America. In 2016, it was bought by its larger rival Just Eat for $110 million.|||
