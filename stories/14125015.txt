Installing Anbox on a regular Linux system isn't hard when you already have the ability to install snaps. Packaging anbox within a snap makes it really easy for us to put all necessary bits together and ship it to you!

If your system doesn't support snaps, then we currently don't have an easy way for you to install Anbox. However, this might change in the near future.

Installing Anbox is pretty easy as we provide an installer which will install all necessary things on your system. Please be aware that the installer requires root privileges on your systems as it has to install things like additional kernel modules via DKMS. You can have a look at the installer script here.

WARNING: Before you go ahead and install Anbox on your system, please keep in mind that Anbox currently is ALPHA level software. Not every feature is supposed to work or work well yet. You will find bugs, you will see crashes and unexpected problems. When you do so, please report a bug here.

When you're ready to install Anbox on your system everything you need is the following command line. The installer will tell you about everything it is doing and will prompt for any further necessary input from your side:

If you need more help or want to see what happens during the installation you can have a look at the following screencast:|||
