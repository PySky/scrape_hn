The Silicon Valley security and analytics firm whose algorithms were used in the government's search for Osama bin Laden is agreeing to pay $1.7 million to resolve US Department of Labor charges that the company discriminated against Asians applying for engineering jobs.

The deal requires Palantir, which has scored US intelligence and defense contracts worth more than $340 million since 2010, to extend job offers to as many as eight people denied employment. Plantir said it was not admitting any wrongdoing in the settlement deal.

"We disagree with the allegations made by the Department of Labor. We settled this matter, without any admission of liability, in order to focus on our work. We continue to stand by our employment record and are glad to have resolved this case," Palantir said in the statement.

Last year, labor officials charged that Asian applicants were "routinely eliminated" from being hired by Palantir despite them being "as qualified as white applicants."

Had Palantir not settled or beaten the allegations, its ability to secure future government contracts could have remained in jeopardy. That's because companies that contract with the US government are prohibited from discriminating against their employees for race, skin color, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.|||
