Mike is not your average cab driver. He spent years establishing a successful taxi company in Banff ,Alberta; during which he did something that made him and his taxi company the talk of the town.

Banff is a big ski town. It features soaring mountains and shines with bars, restaurants and tourists everywhere. There are, of course, many, many taxi drivers in Banff, but Taxi Mike is the only one that built his business through content marketing.

His content marketing is much simpler than you might think. Four times per year. Taxi Mike puts together the “Taxi Mike Dining Guide: Where to Eat in Banff.” It’s a very simple, A4 sized bright yellow paper. It’s not what a marketing manager might consider to be “great” content, but it’s incredibly effective because he was being using to his loyal and potential customers.

Taxi Mike updates his guide with his latest recommendations for best sports bar, hottest nightclub, best place for cheap drinks, and more than a dozen other categories. Taxi Mike makes a few hundred copies and delivers them to every restaurant, hotel, bar, or tourist establishment in the area. You’ll see them on counters all around Banff. And the establishments love to hand them out because Mike’s information is accurate, and just about every place is listed in Taxi Mike’s guide somewhere.

Just imagine, you happen to be in Alberta this weekend and at the end of the night when you’ve been to that great sushi restaurant Taxi Mike's Guide recommended , “Wow, I really should get a cab home,” are you going to walk out on the corner and whistle for a cab or Uber? No. You’re going to reach into your pocket and see the crumpled up, bright yellow piece of paper that has the map of downtown that says, “Call --Taxi Mike ”.

He even has a blog, MikesBloggityBlog, a popular entertainment and travel blog. HILARIOUS.

Simple. Be Relevant . Be Helpful. Create a GREAT customer experience .That's how Taxi Mike grew his business.|||
