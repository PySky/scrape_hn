You can access anything through the internet which is open. If you build something , you can show that to anyone around the world.

Few people want to change this.

Because they are greedy and lazy. Net Neutrality enforces fair competition. Before Facebook there was Orkut. Facebook build a better social network and replaced Orkut.

Now , lets imagine if there was no net neutrality. Consider, you have build a social network which is better than Facebook. You will have to pay the Internet Service Providers like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Charter, CenturyLink, etc to make your services accessible to your consumers. If you don’t pay, no one can access your site. You won’t grow.

Established companies can remain lazy. They don’t have to innovate. They only have to pay your service provider. They will remain as a monopoly. This means death for start-ups.

As a consumer, you may get the basic package for free. It might include Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. Now, if you want to access medium, you will be charged an extra amount say $5, Dropbox another $5 and so on .

To install this , they will have to track you. So it’s a death for privacy. It’s dead and you are already on watch.

Most people are not even aware of the consequences. When the POTUS itself is working against it, Net Neutrality will be a history.

Facebook tried to violate net neutrality in our country (India). We didn’t allow them. We fought against them.

Now, it’s up to you. You can choose to remain silent or raise your voice. The least you can do is to spread this message.|||
