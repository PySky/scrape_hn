Cocoa.dog can only send pictures to phone numbers in the United States

Standard text messaging charges may apply. Cocoa.dog is not responsible for any charges that appear on your phone bill.

We do not store any credit card information and we never see your credit card information. All transactions are processed through Stripe.

I hope to have bitcoin as a payment method soon.

Email cocoa-dog@mail.com with any problems, questions, comments, etc. and I will respond as soon as possible.

If a phone number cannot recieve pictures (Multimedia Messaging Service, or MMS), then a SMS message containing the pictures of dogs will be sent instead.

All pictures are from Unsplash (a website with free to use pictures) or from a Google image search (labeled for reuse).|||
