The world’s quickest sedans battle it out on this episode of Tire Rack’s Head 2 Head (http://www.tirerack.com). The Audi RS7 and Tesla Model S have nearly identical silhouettes and are within 0.2 inch in length. They’re both all-wheel-drive, four-door, hatchback sedans with an eye toward luxury and supercar-taunting powertrains. The RS7 was the quickest four-door car MOTOR TREND had ever tested, but the Performance model adds 55 more horsepower for a total of 605 hp from its 4.0L twin-turbo V-8. The Tesla Model S P90D was even quicker, and now the P100D with Ludicrous Plus proves to be even more speedy. It is, in fact, the quickest-accelerating vehicle MOTOR TREND has ever tested—ever.

MOTOR TREND Senior Features Editors Jason Cammisa and Jonny Lieberman get the two über-sedans together to see which world’s quickest sedan is better. This episode includes a special appearance by the fastest gasoline-powered car you can buy today, the 2017 Porsche 911 Turbo S, and a whole lot of horse manure.|||
