Warren Buffett is famous for handshake deals and one-page contracts. He often buys multi-billion-dollar companies after a few phone calls, usually without ever meeting the management team in person or visiting their facilities. Not only that, but he typically pays below market prices and avoids dealing with investment bankers. Despite all this, he has amassed a collection of over 65 wholly owned companies, ranging from See’s Candies, to Dairy Queen, to Fruit of The Loom.

Today, his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is worth almost $500 billion.

So, if he pays below market, refuses to negotiate, and won’t even visit them in person, why do wealthy entrepreneurs and families sell to him? Because he makes it easy.

Selling your business is usually a long and frustrating experience, full of stops and starts, hard-nosed negotiation, and emotional flareups.

It typically takes 6–12 months and the process looks something like this:

Now let’s look at Warren Buffett’s process for buying a business:

Starting to understand why people like selling companies to Warren Buffett, even if it costs them a little? In addition to making the process painless, he also commits not to meddle with the core business, to keep existing management in place, and to hold the business forever.

I now own almost ten operating businesses, so there’s usually somebody trying to buy one of them. In the past, I’ve gone by the “I’ll always pick up the phone” policy, so whenever a potential buyer has been interested in one of my businesses, I’d always talk to them to see if their number made sense. Everything has a price, or so I thought…

Over the years, I’ve heard the right price many times. I’ve gotten excited and mentally decided to sell various businesses over the years, but in reality, I’ve only sold one. Instead of rolling around in my solid gold lambo making it rain, I’ve instead experienced the frustrating, distracting process that I mentioned above. In the past five years, we’ve been through five sale processes for different businesses and only had one deal go through, and on average, I’ve spent 6 to 8 months per year in a process.

In short, my life has sucked for the past five years. Collectively, I’ve spent months on the phone doing pointless calls with potential buyers. Talking to investment bankers. Negotiating deals that will never close. Forcing my accounting team to do endless diligence. All time that could have been spent growing my businesses or enjoying life. It’s been a huge waste of time and a massive distraction from running my companies.

The funny thing is, had somebody just pulled a Buffett and made it easy, I would have sold every time. I was mentally and emotionally ready to do a deal, but I’m an entrepreneur. I’m high paced. I make a decision, and I want it to happen. I couldn’t understand why buyers felt they needed to dig into accounting minutae. In one deal, we spent a month doing an audit over a .5% revenue fluctuation between two months. It didn’t need to be this complicated: all our businesses are easy to understand, asset-light, and easy to verify revenues for.

After five years of it, I’m done. The process is broken. We’re rolling up our sleeves, flipping sides, and becoming the buyer we’ve always wanted. We’re building the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. We call it Tiny.

When we started Tiny earlier this year, we set out to mirror Buffett and make it enjoyable and easy for owners to sell us their business. Our first acquisition was Dribbble, in January, and it took a little more than two months in total.

The owners, Dan and Rich, had been peppered with acquisition interest for years. When they decided to consider a sale, we were able to offer them a quick, straightforward conversation about what they wanted and how we could could make it happen. In weeks, we knew we had a deal and shook hands on the terms. There was no complex diligence process, no earnouts to haggle over, and no renegotiation once we’d shook hands. In short, we made it painless and did whatever was needed make them comfortable. We took the Buffett road.

Our process? Simple. We focused on three key things:

We spent about a week coming to terms on a fair price and key terms, shook hands on a deal, and closed in a little over two months. No fuss, no muss.

Sure, we could have spent another 3 months in diligence. We could have tried to renegotiate the terms and ground them down. We could have spent weeks picking apart their management team. But we would have lost the deal, and if we didn’t lose it, they would have been miserable and our relationship would have started off on the wrong foot.

Like Berkshire, we also agreed to leave the existing team in place and stay the hell out of their way. We’re always available to help with important hires (if the seller wants to step back, replacing them), and anything else they need (accounting, legal issues, strategy, etc), but they get as much or as little attention as they ask for. Unlike more traditional buyer we plan to leave the companies we buy to keep doing what they’re doing for the longterm. We bought them because they are awesome, and we want them to stay that way.

Since we closed the Dribbble deal in January, I’m happy to report that we’ve bought another 3 companies, with each deal taking less than a month to close.

Let’s be real, we’re a long way from being Berkshire Hathaway. We’re Tiny, both literally and figuratively. We’re just wannabes at this point. Our market cap is many billions of times smaller than Berkshire’s, but we want to use Buffett’s methodology to keep buying more and more wonderful internet businesses. While he focuses on railroads and fast food chains, we want to buy simple, profitable internet businesses with great teams.

We know that there are thousands of phenomenal entrepreneurs out there who want to sell their business but don’t want to deal with the brain damage. They don’t want to freak out their staff. They don’t want their business to be put at risk by a short-term oriented buyer who will try to pump and dump. They don’t want to answer to a micro-managey board. I know that, because I was one of them, and I talk to more and more people like me every day.

Spread the word. There’s a better way to sell your business :-)
