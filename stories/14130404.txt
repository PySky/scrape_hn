OnLeaks and Android Authority have published two 360-degree CAD render videos of the upcoming Moto C and Moto C Plus smartphones yesterday. Now we’ve got a closer view of the Lenovo’s. This is not the first leak, of these devices to show up on the web; OnLeaks have already brought-out the press renders of the products in the past week.

Anyhow, the videos gives away the best shots and a crystal-clear picture, on how the device will exactly look like. The previously leaked press renders and the new videos, mutually reveals that both the Moto C and Moto C Plus devices, looks almost alike, though there are some noticeable differences.

One of the prominent difference is the Moto C has no Camera bump, but the C Plus’s camera is somewhat protruded from its back cover. And yes, it is needless to say that both the devices will differ in their sizes, too.

Both the devices has a large rear camera modules; while the Moto C features a textured pattern, on the power button. We’ve already seen this type of texture, used in plenty of other devices too; it used to differentiate the power button from the volume rocker.

The other interesting things, we could infer from the high resolution CAD renders are: Both the smartphones feature a 3.5mm audio jack, along with a Micro USB for the charging port, instead of the regular USB Type-C. This would’ve been a decision, likely made to keep the cost of these devices, low and affordable.

Yet, the official pricing and availability details of these devices are not mentioned. All these above information, derived from the new videos are not a real deal, but is as close to it that we can get right now.|||
