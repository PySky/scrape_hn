A tool for setting up WireGuard connections from peer to peer.

It takes care of exchanging public keys, IP addresses and NAT traversal.

!!! This tool has ALPHA quality. Prepare for the worst and backup /etc/wireguard !!!

Alice creates a new WireGuard configuration file on her computer named . (Bob does the same on his machine.)

Alice publishes her public key, so Bob can find it.

Alice adds Bob's public key to her configuration file. (Bob does the same on his machine.)

The daemon mode periodically looks up Bob's latest IP address and takes care about NAT traversal automatically.

Just start the daemon on Alice's and Bob's computer like this:

Alice and Bob can determine their current IP address and setup NAT traversal (using STUN) and publish it.

This has to be done initially and from time to time when both IP addresses change or the NAT traversal expired.|||
