Keybase connects your social identities (say, your Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit account) to your public keys. Public key cryptography allows encrypted conversations, digital signatures, and other sweet, savory security. It is magical, but confusing. Keybase tries to make it easier.

Our mobile app (with chat and file sharing) is almost ready. In the meantime, you can create a web account to start connecting your social id's.

The desktop app is available on macOS, Windows, and Linux: download it here.|||
