Apple has acquired a sleep tracking hardware and software company, TechCrunch has confirmed. News of the acquisition was first reported by CNBC.

In a post on Beddit‘s privacy policy page, the company also confirmed that it has been acquired and furthermore that user information “will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.”

Terms of the acquisition were unavailable at this time, but we’ll keep sniffing.

Beddit launched its products in Apple stores in late 2015. Apple stores carrying products serve as a great physical version of an app analytics suite, allowing Apple to see with firsthand data what’s popular and the demographic attraction of its products.

The Finland-based company was founded in 2007 and has received about $3.5 million in funding. Beddit’s latest product, the Beddit 3, is a thin strip of sensors that goes across a user’s bed, analyzing sleep-related data such as “sleep time and efficiency, heart rate, respiration, temperature, movement, snoring, room temperature, and room humidity,” according to a product description. The device retails for about $150 and is still up for sale on the Apple Store page.

Don’t expect to see an Apple-branded mattress popping up any time soon; chances are the folks in Cupertino are more interested in the company’s methods of measuring sleep quality.

As of this point, we understand that the customer service experience on Beddit’s site will remain as-is. This means that current customers will be able to access its products and services support for the foreseeable future. What happens long term is unclear as Apple very rarely acquires companies that continue to operate independently indefinitely… though recent acquisition Workflow just received an update that added functionality as well as maintenance.|||
