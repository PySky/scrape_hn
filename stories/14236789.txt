As a matter of principle, we shouldn't pay with our toner or ink for someone else to put ads on tickets we've paid for.

You will need Inkscape to generate or update the PDFs, and pdftk to block ads.

For convenience, PDFs are included in the repository. (They're smaller than the source SVG files!)

Make your own blockers using Inkscape. Create a new document of the same paper size (this is sometimes surprising: EU-based EasyJet uses US Letter) with a transparent background, and a white rectangle at the appropriate location, and check that it works. Then open a PR!|||
