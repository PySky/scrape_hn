You probably read the story about “Oil and Gas International” website complaining in Firefox bug tracker about annoying “insecurity” popup.

Few hours ago that poor website was hacked with SQL injection by reddit sciptkiddies. So proud of you guys (not).

Entire tone of the tweets I saw around were shaming the company, not Firefox. I disagree.

This is the page Mozilla links to in that popup. Which later points to page “for developers” (just as useless as the first page)

This is where Chrome is taking you with less intrusive Not Secure sign next to website URL. Relevant part: “To help you stay on safe on the web, Chrome requires websites to use certificates from trusted organizations.”

None of that pages focuses on what should be users doing with this info and, more importantly, what the developer should be doing to stop that (use LetsEncrypt).

By the way: your recommendation “to not enter credentials on an insecure connection” goes out of the window just after all those “create a unique password”.

These pages must do following:

You need to entirely rewrite “Not Secure” pages. They make no sense. Make it clear why insecure connection is deprecated + they need to contact developers + tell developers how to implement LetsEncrypt.

Optional: do whatever it takes to make Nginx/Apache add it by default like Caddy did.|||
