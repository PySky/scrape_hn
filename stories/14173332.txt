Emacs 25.1 has a wide variety of new features, including:

Emacs can now load shared/dynamic libraries (modules). A dynamic Emacs module is a shared library that provides additional functionality for use in Emacs Lisp programs, just like a package written in Emacs Lisp would. Enhanced network security (TLS/SSL certificate validity and the like) via the new Network Security Manager (NSM). New minor mode 'electric-quote-mode' for using curved quotes as you type. New and improved facilities for inserting Unicode characters: now has shorthands for several chars, such as U+2010 (HYPHEN), U+2011 (NON-BREAKING HYPHEN), and U+2012 (FIGURE DASH).
