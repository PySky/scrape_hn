Lyrics:

I see what's happening here

You're face to face with greatness and it's strange

And your adoration is clear

You're adorable!

It's nice to see that children never change



It’s time for the lesson, let's begin

Yes, it's really me, it's Mommy: breathe it in!



I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod!

When you stand before a wonder broad



What can I say except you're welcome

For the heart, the home, the calm

Hey it's okay, it's okay

You're welcome

I'm just an ordinary super mom



Hey!

There at your birth we moved heaven and earth

Straight outta whose vagina?

Mine-a!



When the night gets cold

Who holds you close and won't let go

You're looking at her, yo!



Oh, also I lasso the dough

You're welcome!

To stretch our funds and buy Lego



Also, I harvested these

You're welcome!

To fill your tummy with nummies



So, what can I say except you're welcome

For the mountains I move for you

There's no need to pray, it's okay

You're welcome!

You know it's just how us mommies do

You're welcome!

You're welcome!



We'll, come to think of it

Kid, I know that it's so mysterial

That you're our genetic material

Your body, your heart, your mind

That's just mommy and daddy combined

I found a man

I fixed him up

Wedded him, bedded him, now he's your pop

Here is the moral,

Better not forget it…

I know what I want and I know how to get it.



And the stretch marks here on my skin

Remind me of the shape I was in

Look where I've been

I made everything happen

Look at you mini-mommy just a pittery-patterin', chittery-chattering, clittery-clatterin’ – hey, hey, hey!



We'll, anyway let me say you're welcome

For the wonderful world you know

Hey, it's okay, it's okay

You're welcome!

But now it's time for bed, you gotta go



We had a good day so I'll say you're welcome

Now a hug and kiss because it's time

You’re all tucked in, the lights dim

You're welcome!

Now mommy can unwind and have some wine



You're welcome!

You're welcome!

And thank you, mom.|||
