Lyrics:



Sam Adams led the Sons of Liberty

a Patriot group to stand up to the King

(cuz Britain) imposed many taxes on the colonies

Like glass, oil, tea, so on December 16th, 1773



The Boston Tea Party

Three ships loaded with English tea were docked in the Boston port

The Boston Tea Party

The Townshend Act still had a tax on tea the Patriots did not support

The Boston Tea Party

Hundreds of Patriots dressed as Indians marched to the wharf and climbed aboard

The Boston Tea Party

And they threw three hundred forty chests of tea into the Boston harbor



The damage caused Britain a few million $$

Because of taxation without representation

That means, have a say in taxes from a local representative

And not from a King on the other side of the Atlantic



The Boston Tea Party

92,000 pounds of tea were dumped into Griffinâ€™s Wharf

The Boston Tea Party

a political protest on a tax the Patriots did not support

The Boston Tea Party

Parliament responded with the Intolerable Acts and shut down the Boston port

The Boston Tea Party

An iconic event that started the American Revolutionary War
