For more than a month now, I’ve been on a cookie diet: I’ve disabled all browser cookies.

The main issue is logging into any website, as Web authentication requires a cookie to be stored on the client’s computer.

Some basic interactions, like adding items to a cart, are not possible anymore.

Some website don’t even load, because a script tries but fails to access localStorage.

I liked the Forbes one in particular.

Weirdly enough, by allowing the pattern , I can log in to GMail without being automaticlly logged in to Google, YouTube, and Blogger.

Honestly, it’s a pain to maintain. By using a whitelist strategy, every time I encounter a login form, I need to manually add the domain pattern to the list of approved websites. And when a website doesn’t load at all, I just don’t bother.

Do I feel less tracked and more secure? Of course! /s|||
