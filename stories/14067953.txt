BespON is a configuration language focused on concise syntax, superior string and number support, and lossless round-tripping.

Lossless round-tripping – Designed to be loaded by a computer, modified, and then saved while retaining exact layout, including comments.

Strings and numbers – Literal and escaped multiline strings that are ideal for storing template text. Floats and integers, in multiple bases, with Infinity and NaN to support IEEE 754.

Multi-paradigm – Do you like braces, brackets, and explicit quotation marks, with no significant whitespace? Would you rather leave out some quotation marks and use significant indentation instead of braces and brackets? Do you prefer INI-style sections, with no braces or brackets and no indentation? BespON supports all three styles.

# Line comments are allowed! They can always be round-tripped as long as data

# elements are only modified, not added or removed.

### This is a doc comment. It can always be round-tripped.###

# Only one doc comment is allowed per data element; another couldn't be here.

# Full IEEE 754 compatibility. Infinity and NaN are not excluded.

"""string containing no whitespace lines in which line breaks

are replaced with spaces, and "quotes" are possible by via delimiters"""

A literal string in which linebreaks are kept (as '

')

and leading indentation (relative to delimiters) is preserved,

with special delimiters always on lines by themselves.

The same idea as the literal string, but with backslash escapes.

# Same as "section = {subsection = {key = value}}"

# Back to root level. Can be omitted if sections never return to root.|||
