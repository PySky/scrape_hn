Whether you call them data caps or data plans, it’s clear consumers hate them.

While some companies have been getting more heat than others for their trials of “data plans” or data caps more and more consumers are factoring the presence of data caps when choosing which provider to get service with.

That said, we’ve compiled a list of every wired provider (Cable, DSL, and Fiber Optic) in the US that lists data caps on their website.

Our full time data collectors comb providers websites, collect plan details, and read the fine print in an effort to standardize different broadband plans.

While each provider has their own unique (and often confusing) way of presenting their plans and prices, we collect this data so consumers can quickly cut through the marketing jargon and look at the plan details that really matter to making an informed decision.

With all this in mind, we strive to only collect plans that are 10mbps or faster when available. Because of this the data caps shown on this page generally reflect the 10mbps speed but different data caps may be present on different plans.|||
