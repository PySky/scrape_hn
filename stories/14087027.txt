Nano Dimension develops advanced 3D printed electronics platforms and nanotechnology-based conductive and dielectric inks for their 3D printers and the company is looking at further expansion to support additional board technologies including flexible circuits and embedded components.

Humair Mandavia, Chief Strategy Officer, Zuken USA, said: “The CR-8000 Design Force retains all the detailed data needed for 3D printing and allows export direct to manufacturing or 3D printing, without losing integrity.”

Design Force allows specification of unique rules for materials, meaning no extra steps are needed when 3D printing to silver and any other future conductive material. Zuken also offers dedicated DFM solutions to support printed electronics via its DFM Inkjet module that optimises CAD data for inkjet printers.|||

Zuken and Nano Dimension are looking to improve the 3D printing user experience and prototype turnaround times. Using Zuken’s CR-800 Design Force, a native 3D, system-level design solution, Nano Dimension, a leader in electronic printing technologies, will take advantage of the support it offers for implementing electronic technologies.
