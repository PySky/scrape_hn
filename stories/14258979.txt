At Moor Interactive we continuously improve our development and deployment workflows in order to provide a very reliable process for getting our code to production as fast as possible. Over the decade we have intensively worked with Jenkins as our CI/CD platform. Travis CI and Drone are also platforms we used a lot in the years as we used to store everything in Git (the thing we missed about Jenkins and it's job configurations).

Last week we took some time to look at the first public version of the Jenkins Blue Ocean plugin (in combination with Pipelines) and decide whether it's worth using it instead of focussing more and more on platforms like Travis CI and Drone.

In this blog post we take you through the basic concepts of Blue Ocean and Pipelines and how to setup your own platform withÂ Docker Compose.
