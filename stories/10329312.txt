Gone are the days of just swiping left or right on Tinder. On Thursday, the popular dating app unveiled a new feature that allows users to swipe up if they have a higher level of interest in a person based on his or her profile.

The new option—dubbed "Super Like"—launched in Australia last month but is now available to users everywhere. If you "super like" someone on the app, a blue star will appear on your profile when the person you are interested in stumbles across your profile. Tinder users have to be selective, however, in the profiles they choose to swipe up. Users can only "super like" one profile a day, unless they pay for Tinder Plus—in which case the limit jumps to five up-swipes a day.

"Tinder is known for being fun to use, but at heart we’re about forging real connections between people,” said Sean Rad, CEO of Tinder.

The impetus behind the "super like" option is to help users weed out less serious matches and find people they will likely have a stronger connection with. With the launch Tinder is also likely trying to combat the rise of other dating apps—such as Bumble and Hinge—and shed the "hookup app" reputation for which it has been criticized in recent months.|||
