Like 10 minutes easy. And free. The key is Amazon Certificate Manager on Amazon Web Services.

A few days ago I wrote about how I was able to build and deploy a WebGL game of Flappy Bird to a live website in 35 minutes. I glossed over the fact that there was no SSL.

Who cares if my Flappy Bird is not served over HTTPS?

Do you want this giant “Not secure” icon on your page?

Google also announced in *2014* that SSL is a ranking signal. Should you risk being ranked lower in search results because you were too lazy / poor to set up SSL?

I do not want to do this again.

Gandi.net gives you free SSL for the first year, but charges about 16 bucks for subsequent years, more doubling the price of a domain for a single site. Was it really worth shelling out the extra cash for that side project?

As much as I like supporting the little domain providers like Gandi, the process of connecting a domain to SSL on AWS was dead simple and the cost is…

Here’s how I set it up. I’m assuming you’ve used AWS’s static site wizard that I explained in my last article.

That’s it. 10 minutes and zero dollars.|||
