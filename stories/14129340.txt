Soraida Salwala opened the World’s First Asian Elephant Hospital in Lampang, Thailand in 1993 to treat elephants that are ill or injured as a result of work, abuse or neglect.

When Soraida Salwala was a young girl, she and her father happened upon an elephant that had been hit by a car. She wanted to take "Uncle Elephant" to the hospital; when her father informed her that there was no hospital for elephants, she was heartbroken.

Friends of the Asian Elephant Hospital assists in medical care and help to promote a better understanding of the elephant's physiology, important in treating them for illness.

Animals are living beings thus, suffer the same trauma and depression like human beings. Every year hundreds of elephants are killed for Ivory trade. According to a study published by global experts, t he number of elephants across Africa has dropped by 111,000 in just 10 years to only 415,000 today.|||
