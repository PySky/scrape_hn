The DJI Inspire 1 Pro features the Zenmuse X5 camera which is able to capture video at up to DCI 4K 4096 x 2160 at 23.98p or UHD 4K at 29.97p . For iPad Pro, Air or Mini users, you may wish to view the 4K footage from DJI Inspire 1 Pro on the iPad model you happen to carry with. The following article will talk about the possibility of playing Inspire 1 Pro 4K on all iPad series and how to convert Inspire 4K footage to the best format, size, aspect ratio, etc for iPad playback.

This answer should be divided in two aspects: can iPad series handle 4K resolution video, if yes, what type of 4K video can iPad series handle. For the first question, we get the answer that currently only iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 have the capability to handle 4K resolution video, if you are using the previous model of iPad models such as iPad Mini 3/2, iPad 4/3/2 or iPad Air to view 4K video, your iPad will automatically downscale 4K to 1080p, the quality of the downconverted 1080p video will depends on the originals 4K video quality and also the the video player on your iPad that you use to perform the downconversion process, you may get a result that’s worse than if you play native 1080p video.

After get the first answer, then let’s come to the second question, what type of 4K videos can be played on iPad Pro/Air 2/Mini 4. From Apple’s official page, we get the information that iPad Pro/Air 2/iPad Mini 4 can playback 4K video meet the following standards:

H.264 video up to 4K, 30 frames per second, High Profile level 4.2 with AACLC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio or Dolby Audio up to 1008 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo or multichannel audio, in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats

Container format: MP4 or MOV

 Compress Codec: MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 

 Video Resolution and frame rate: 

 DCI 4K (4096 x 2160): 24p, 25p 

 UHD 4K (3840 x 2160): 25p, 30p 

 Video bit rate: up to 60Mbps 

 From above lists, we can see that although the DJI Inspire 1 Pro records iPad Pro/Air 2/Mini 4 compatible 4K container file format and compression codec.
