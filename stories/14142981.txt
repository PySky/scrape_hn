One of the greatest things about Caffe is the vibrant community of developers and researchers that share their work in the Caffe model zoo. You can use these models to quickly build demo applications and explore deep learning capabilities without doing any time-consuming and resource-intensive training. You can recreate and evaluate the results from others' projects, hack together new uses, or improve upon the previously posted models.|||
