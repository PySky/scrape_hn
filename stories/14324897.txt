We demonstrate how OSv unikernels can be deployed on Kubernetes using Virtlet.



Demo application[1] with 5 microservices is deployed using 5 OSv unikernels[2]. A Docker container connects to the application to display result.



Eventually, ease of scaling is demonstrated by scaling worker microservice from 1 instance to 2.
