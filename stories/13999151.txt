You have a blog post. It contains links. Some can be affiliate links. Some can't. 



 You can check your links and manually add your affiliate tokens. It's time consuming, boring and prone to errors. 

 Or you can use Affiliator :) 



 Affiliator will add your affiliate tokens where appropriate. Without touching anything else. Easy peasy. 



 Affiliator manages affiliate links for Amazon, iTunes, B&H, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Staples, Shopify, Etsy and many more.
