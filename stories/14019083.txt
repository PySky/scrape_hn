Softgun is a an embedded system simulator. Softgun is known to run linux blob and u-boot for the ARM-9 processors Digi NS9750, Freescale i.MX21 and Atmel AT91RM9200. Also softgun can emulate the ATMega 644 based game console "Uzebox", the Renesas Microcontrollers RX, M32C and R8C. Softgun was written because i had to port embedded Linux to boards before i had the hardware. Softgun runs on a Linux host and with some restrictions on Cygwin.Here softgun plays a "Heidi" video on a monochrome 128x64 display. The simulated board is based on the Renesas RX62N CPU and is running with 96 MHz.|||
