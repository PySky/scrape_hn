There are several physical and practical limits to the amount of computation or data storage that can be performed with a given amount of mass, volume, or energy:

Several methods have been proposed for producing computing devices or data storage devices that approach physical and practical limits:

In the field of theoretical computer science the computability and complexity of computational problems are often sought-after. Computability theory describes the degree to which problems are computable; whereas complexity theory describes the asymptotic degree of resource consumption. Computational problems are therefore confined into complexity classes. The arithmetical hierarchy and polynomial hierarchy classify the degree to which problems are respectively computable and computable in polynomial time. For instance, the level of the arithmetical hierarchy classifies computable, partial functions. Moreover, this hierarchy is strict such that at any other class in the arithmetic hierarchy classifies strictly uncomputable functions.

Many limits derived in terms of physical constants and abstract models of computation in Computer Science are loose.[10] Very few known limits directly obstruct leading-edge technologies, but many engineering obstacles currently cannot be explained by closed-form limits.|||
