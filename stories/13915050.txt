To understand the security threat to the Xen hypervisor, we systematically studied all 175 security vulnerabilities published on Xen Security Advisories (XSA), of which 131 (74.86%) are directly related to the core hypervisor. (See 'XSAs Classified by Exploiting Hypervisor or Not' to learn about those not directly attacking hypervisor)

The analysed data includes all XSAs before XSA-185. (XSA-185 is released on 2016-09-08, which is not avaliable at that time)|||
