The Bureau Local is an innovative journalism and technology team working with local reporters to dig into datasets and tell the stories that matter to communities across the UK.

We believe local journalists are crucial in holding power to account.

But their ability to do this is being threatened as newsrooms cut budgets and staff alongside the time and resources given to much-needed investigative reporting.

This has happened at the same time the digitisation of information has grown exponentially. In every area of public and private life, information that was previously found on paper now exists on computers, and there is far more of it. Having the tools to access and analyse this abundance of data is now critical for effective reporting.

There are many powerful public interest stories out there that will only be discovered if traditional investigative techniques are combined with technology. We will work with the UKâ€™s local media to develop a new approach to reporting in a digitised society.|||
