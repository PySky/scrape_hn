All the stadiums and libraries are named after brands, rich people, dead people or rich dead people. Nothing in homeless shelters is named after anybody. We set out to change that. Naming rights to the toilet ($200), all the beds ($250/ea), the spoons ($10/ea), the playground slide ($750)... were put up for sale on the site. As of this writing, people who’ve probably never so much as driven by the shelter here in Durham, NC, have spent $86k to put their name on everyday items that you and I take for granted every day.|||
