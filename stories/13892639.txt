In January 2010, Seiji Ozawa was on the brink of death.

Diagnosed with esophageal cancer, the famed Japanese conductor was rushed to the hospital. At 75 years of age, there was no guarantee he would survive.

The only choice the doctors had was to cut into Ozawa’s body and remove his esophagus. His stomach was then stretched up to his collarbone and surgically attached to his throat. To this day, he has a scar on his neck from where they sliced him.

For an ordinary person, that would be end of a career.

But not Seiji Ozawa. In less than a year, despite warnings from doctors, friends and family, Ozawa was back on stage doing what he had done for his whole life — making music.

After surgery, the man could barely stand on the best of days. Yet, on stage, he was full of life.

Another creative master, the novelist Murakami Haruki, was there to see Ozawa’s performance. Haruki describes Ozawa’s performance in Absolutely on Music:

Ozawa’s performance triggered a feeling in Haruki that, as a novelist, he understand with a fierce intimacy:

For Ozawa, music is life. For Haruki, writing is life. These are two men from different disciplines, but at the core, they are one and the same.

In Absolutely on Music, Haruki is constantly making connections between himself and Ozawa:

What does Haruki mean by this way of life? How do Haruki and Ozawa differ from ordinary people?

Haruki points out three similarities between Ozawa and himself.|||
