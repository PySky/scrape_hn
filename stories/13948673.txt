While visiting Iceland this past year, I discovered Eivør, a Faroese-Icelandic singer-songwriter, whose music seemed to seamlessly blend into Iceland's unique landscape. I began to imagine what her music might look like as a landscape itself. Using her song ' Í Tokuni ', I created an application that plots spectrogram data on a 2D plane that is then extruded along the Z-axis to create a topographic relief.

The application gives additional control over the various methods of averaging spectrogram data, 2D plotting configurations, and equalizing the mapped pixel data using various algorithms. The application generates an OBJ file that can then be imported into any 3D printing software to be prepared for printing. As each piece of music has a unique spectrogram, the resulting 3D landscape is also unique for every piece of music.|||
