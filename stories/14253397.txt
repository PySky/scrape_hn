Strava has appointed James Quarles as its new CEO. Quarles was most recently the VP of Instagram Business and previously regional director of Facebook in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Current CEO and co-founder Mark Gainey will remain at Strava as chairman of the board. Co-founder and former CEO Michael Horvath will also remain on the board.

“After a fifteen-month search, Michael and I found a partner to fully realise Strava’s potential," said Gainey. "James will add tremendous experience and energy to our team, while also providing me and Michael with more opportunities to focus on strategic initiatives that are vital to the company’s long-term success. As a single father, I am also deeply committed to my family. Bringing James on as chief executive allows me to continue to champion Strava's amazing team and community while being a more present dad to my boys.”

Quarles said: "I’m excited to join Mark, Michael and the whole Strava team to inspire this global network of athletes and unlock its tremendous potential. We’re eager to make Strava one of the great sports brands of the 21st century.”

He will leave his post at Instagram later this month and assume the role of Strava CEO on May 30th.|||
