Everyone should be able to experience VR, and WebVR is a big step in that direction. It’s open to all browsers, making it easier for developers to create something quickly and share it with everyone, no matter what device they’re on.

In February, we added WebVR to Chrome on Daydream-ready phones. Today, WebVR on Chrome now works with Google Cardboard, so that anyone with an Android phone and Cardboard can experience virtual worlds just by tapping a link.
