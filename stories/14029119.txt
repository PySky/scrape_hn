Encryption saves lives. The largest users of encryption have been military forces â€“ secret messages have helped win wars, laying the foundation for the United States today. It was the trump card of the militaryâ€¦ It was the trump card of the nationâ€¦ and, as it always was and should be, encryption is we the peoplesâ€™ trump card.

Mankind created all the technologies that have shaped our world. Mankind created weapons. Mankind created laws. Mankind created books. Mankind created computers. Mankind created cameras. Mankind created the Internet.

Mankind creates technology, and of all eras thus far, we are the technology era.

We come in peace, but we come prepared.

We are the people, and we will always be ahead of those seeking to enslave us.

Government officials can create laws, but we can create technologies.

Mankind created encryption, and it makes things unreadable. Encryption exists, and all mankind will use it ðŸ–•. They censor us, so weâ€™ll censor ourselves tooâ€¦ from them. How do you tell someone to ^%#% off? You make it so all they see is you FLICKing them the ^%#% off.

And please remember, society is big, and we are one in solidarity. Just band together. We the people are the most powerful force in the world.|||
