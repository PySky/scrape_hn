When a friend comments on a post that is very popular (I'm talking about posts with hundreds or thousands of comments), I will get an item in my news feed that says "So-And-So commented on this." but it doesn't show their specific comment. There seems to be no way to see the comment my friend made without scrolling through literally hundreds of strangers' comments. Is there??|||
