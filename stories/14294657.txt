In a recent cyber security lawsuit, an insurance company sued by a law firm due to Ransomware Attack for $700,000 in lost income.

The insurance company refused to pay $700,000 in lost billings after the Ransomware Attack.  According to the law firm, they were hit with ransomware last year after one of its lawyers opened an infected attachment.

The law firm agreed to pay the cyber criminals the $25,000 ransom to unlock its files however the process took three months. They had to negotiate terms and established a bitcoin account.  After it all failed, they had to renegotiate and pay additional money as the first decryption tools failed.

During this entire period, the firm alleges its 10 attorneys were left unproductive. They claim this resulted in a loss of $700,000 in billings to the firm. The insurance company stated it paid the maximum policy limit of $20,000 for losses sustained from computer viruses.  They also stated that the law firm’s loss in business income does not meet its policy requirements.
