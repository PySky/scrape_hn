I moved to London with my husband to pursue a PhD, and we didn’t know many of the locals. Realising that we were on our own during Christmas, my PhD supervisor invited both of us to a special Christmas Party hosted by his wife and himself. The year after, he invited us to a special party for faculty-only, so that we wouldn’t feel lonely during the holidays, and this has becoming something of a tradition.

Last June, when Brexit happened, I was devastated (I am an EU grad student). I wrote to my supervisor apologising for not doing any work a week afterwards, explaining that I was deeply depressed by this. He invited me to his office shortly thereafter, and devoted three(!) hours of his precious time - he is a very busy academic and a leader in his field - to discussing the EU referendum with me and showing me patiently, methodically, and sympathetically that it is not the end of the world.

All this on top of my supervisor being a truly stellar mentor and academic guide across four years, supervising my dissertation from its inception to the final stages, reading and re-reading its drafts with consistent freshness, sharpness, enthusiasm, generosity, intellectual rigour, and good humour.

If there is a hall of fame for extraordinary PhD supervisors, the kind that change your life for the better and restore your faith in academia and in humanity, his statue should stand proudly on the central pedestal.|||

A record of unsolicited kindness, unexpected goodwill, and excessive generosity in academia.
