Yes. SkilledTree is role based application such as HR Admin, HR Regional Manager, HR Manager, Recruiter and manager. For information of these roles check our Documents. HR Admin can view whole employee referral program of the company, HR Regional manager can view only his regional referral program, HR manager can view only his location referral program and Recruiter can view only small team of referral program. Suppose, company has four regional head office. You can split this referral program to these 4 different regionals, so each region has own referral program. If the regional head office has different branches in different location, you can again split this referral program to location level. And if your company has many offices in single location then you can again split this program to office or team level. This adds more flexible to your referral program.|||
