The idea of Trump Talk Therapy is to get Trump supporters and opponents talking to each other. We are currently seeing more and more divide within society among the issue of President Trump and an accompanying split into two sides that are both quite vocal but not necessarily talking to each other. I think, a better way forward would be to actually engage in conversations to try to first understand the other sideâ€™s po...int of view, and second find some common ground and compromises, starting at a micro level: each of you.

You just message this page and the chat bot connects you anonymously to a Trump supporter or opponent. The anonymity might make it easier to actually engage in conversation in the first place. Thereâ€™s a report function in case the conversation gets out of hand.|||
