You've probably already lost hours configuring Webpack by adding / removing babel plugins for each feature you want to control in a simple project. Reactfy promises to meet all the basic needs of a React application by simply installing.

Reactfy commits to deliver from the project bundle to the SSR layer. In addition to bringing SSR support for Electron. Everything is ready, with the promise of working from ES5 to the present.

Already behind ecosystem support for flow, object-rest-spread, class-properties ...

Not available yet, working in progress.

Why? Reactfy reads any code and parse/transpile it in runtime. It cost a lot, just imagine for every process, you will read/parse/transpile/tokenize/write.

If you're using, let me know :)|||
