Technical architects play an important role in government. They help bring together technical and non-technical parts of delivery teams. They also set the strategy for projects, making sure work aligns with technical principles and other projects.

GDS is recruiting for more technical architects and we want to attract some of the best talent out there. To do that, we’re trying to make our recruitment process as painless as possible. We’ve published a recruitment guide to provide information to candidates.

The way the government recruitment process works can be quite different to an interview process in the private sector. That’s because the process is guided by the Civil Service Commission recruitment principles.

Our new guide should help applicants prepare for an interview with us. The guide is based on questions that candidates have asked us in the past. For example, we give details on the technical architect role play exercise we use to understand how applicants interact with non-technical stakeholders or domain experts. We also explain how candidates can best answer competency interviews.

The guide provides context to candidates about why the recruitment process is structured the way it is. For example, why we can’t discuss contractual issues during the interview.

We hope that you find this guide a useful overview of what to expect during our technical architect interview process. If you have any ideas on how to make the guide more useful in the future, you can post a comment below.

We are looking for great people to come and work with us and would love to see you apply for a role. If you have more questions about working at GDS you can email our recruitment team.
