Over a month ago we have introduced Quokka.js — the Live Scratchpad for JavaScript in your editor, with access to your project’s files, inline reporting, code coverage, rich output formatting, and much more.

During these few weeks, the tool had been downloaded around 22k times and the number of active users is quickly growing. We are very excited to see people doing so many things with the help of Quokka.js:

Thanks to our users’ feedback, we know we are on the right track to our ambitious goal of creating the best ever JavaScript Scratchpad.

Today we are happy to announce Quokka.js plugin for JetBrains IDEs, such as WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, Rider, AppCode, CLion, Gogland, DataGrip, and Android Studio.

It is very easy to start, just install the plugin, create a new JavaScript/ES6/Typescript/JSX scratch file with Cmd + Shift + N / Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Insert, or use a context menu on an existing project file, and you are ready to go.

Here is a quick overview of what the tool can do for you (you may find detailed tutorial in our docs):

The tool is brought to you by Wallaby.js team and is built on top of the same technology used in our main product. So if you like Quokka.js, and you are ready to take your experiment to the next level, to start turning it into a feature and writing some tests, and would also like the same live editing features for your unit tests and all files of your project, and a lot more, then definitely check out Wallaby.js.
