ImageSharp has made excellent progress and contains many great features but is still considered by us to be still in early stages (alpha). As such, we cannot support its use on production environments until the library reaches release candidate status. Pre-release downloads are available from the MyGet package repository .

ImageSharp is a fully featured, fully managed, cross-platform, 2D graphics API designed to allow the processing of images without the use of System.Drawing. Built against .Net Standard 1.1 ImageSharp can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

Without the constraints of System.Drawing We have been able to develop something much more flexible, easier to code against, and much, much less prone to memory leaks.

Gone are system-wide process-locks; ImageSharp images are thread-safe and fully supported in web environments.

Here's an example of the code required to load an image from a file, resize it, and save it back to the filesystem as a jpeg with a quality of 75.

For advanced usage a generic class is available allowing developers to implement their own color models in the same manner as Microsoft XNA Game Studio and MonoGame.|||
