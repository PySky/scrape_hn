QuinnMillsMusic.com | LYRICS |



Tell me if you want it

Baby you can take it

Tell me if you got it

Baby imma take it 

Cause you're my baby

And lately

I've been missing you



So baby be straight up

You wanna be laid up

In the back of a nice car

With my hands wrapped around you

Because you like to feel alive so

I'll remind you

That you're mine



Baby let me in

Cause I'm not gonna quit

Baby I'll admit

You want it too

It's what I do

Let me get down with you



Tell me if you want it

Baby you can take it

Lately I've been honest

I've been meaning to say this

I'm dissipated, stimulated

Don't think this through 



Baby let me in

Cause I'm not gonna quit

Baby I'll admit

You want it too

It's what I do

Let me get down with you
