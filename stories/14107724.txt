Databazel natively connects to MongoDB and present the results in a visual dashboard reporting interface, without requiring any additional development on your end.

No ETL. We believe you should keep data where it is and use tools that are smart enough to visualize data directly from MongoDB without building ETL.

Our solution is completely web-based so all you need to get started is a web browser!

You can share the created charts with your teammates.
