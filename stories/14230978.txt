We are all becoming increasingly comfortable with, and welcome the concept of, a single cable powering a device whilst also providing network connectivity. As such, the term PoE is now commonplace, and likely prompts thoughts of security cameras or wireless access points.

Now that PoE has reached a level of maturity as a technology and standard, let’s take a closer look at one its more novel applications, PoE Lighting.

Let’s walk before we run, though, and take a look at what PoE is.

In essence, PoE (Power over Ethernet) is the use of one Ethernet cable providing data and power to a device. This generalist approach of using one cable for multiple functions across multiple manufacturers requires structure and guidelines, for which standards have been developed into its current form known as PoE+ (IEEE 802.3at), superseding regular PoE (IEEE 802.3af). The rest of this post will ignore vendor specific incarnations of these, such as the Cisco UPOE standard.

The change from PoE to PoE+ has been prompted by increasingly power hungry PoE devices and the lure of new opportunities that more power will open up.

LED technology is still progressing, continuing to become more cost effective and energy efficient overall. It is this reduction in power requirements that has enabled PoE lighting to become possible, with the average circuit power requirements being well within that of a compliant PoE port.

In addition, the growth of consumer PoE devices (WAPs, IP Cameras et al) has brought the cost of PoE switches down, providing additional possibilities in the lighting arena.

We are now at a stage where PoE is not only technologically possible but a viable alternative to traditional mains voltage lighting.|||
