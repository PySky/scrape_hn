The shell of a Volkswagen Beetle car hangs from underneath the Golden Gate Bridge on a foggy Monday morning, Feb. 5, 2001. Engineering students at the University of British Columbia said they were responsible for tethering the shell of an old Volkswagen Beetle to the railing of the Golden Gate Bridge and then tossing it over the side. The stunt backed up rush-hour traffic as gawkers slowed to look at the dangling car. less

The Golden Gate Bridge: the perfect backdrop for a powerful protest or a stupid stunt.

After writing about the exploits of Robert Niles, who parachuted from bridges in search of fame, I dug into The Chronicle’s archives for other stunts at the Greatest Bridge Ever Built. These are some of the most memorable.

In August 1977, three Cal Poly students set out to end their summer break with a bang. Around 6:40 a.m. Aug. 31, they threw on hardhats, snapped a safety line to a cable and started inching their way up toward the top of the Golden Gate Bridge’s North Tower, disappearing into the fog.

California Highway Patrol officers used a bullhorn to order the students to come down, but they finished their mission, which ended in their arrests when they touched down on the bridge’s deck. They told the officers they were experienced climbers and had planned the stunt for two months. It was “a little scarier than they expected,” The Chronicle reported, with the vehicles’ vibrations shaking the cable and the fog making their ascent slippery.

Two years later, on Oct. 9, 1979, five British citizens bungee-corded themselves to the bridge and went over the side. Then — oops! — the line snapped and yanked them back up almost to the walkway. Four of the five lowered themselves down to the bay below, but a woman remained stuck in the lines. She was helped to a Coast Guard vessel, while two of the others escaped on a speedboat, leaving their comrades to their fate, Chronicle scribe Steve Rubenstein reported.

One of the first politically motivated Golden Gate Bridge stunts came in May 1981, when Dave Aguilar climbed the South Tower to protest offshore oil drilling. He claimed to be an experienced mountain climber, but police and bridge workers had to scale the tower to bring him down. Traffic was at a near-standstill for hours.

Steve Trotter was a professional daredevil when he celebrated his 23rd birthday on Nov. 13, 1985, by lowering himself from the International Orange deck to the water with an improvised pulley-and-cable system. A few months earlier, he had successfully gone over Niagara Falls in an inner tube-wrapped barrel, escaping with only a minor cut on his arm.

His luck seemed to change during his San Francisco stunt, when one of his gloves got jammed in the pulley, and, according to Trotter, he “swung back and forth in the wind like a giant pendulum at about 70 miles an hour for several minutes.” While he was swinging, a freighter passed within 50 feet of him, “and that was frightening,” Trotter told The Chronicle. He soon became too weak to hang on and dropped to the water. To his surprise, the friends who were supposed to pick him up in a speedboat weren’t there, but, fortunately for him, the Coast Guard soon arrived and he survived, luck somewhat intact.

Political groups have grabbed most of the bridge-stunt headlines over the past three decades. Greenpeace bungeed off the bridge in 1988 and pro-Tibet demonstrators climbed the towers and flew their banners in 2008.

Of the recent Golden Gate Bridge protests, the Headwaters Forest demonstration seemed to rile people the most. On Nov. 24, 1996, the nine-person protest led by actor Woody Harrelson climbed the towers, jamming Saturday bridge traffic for five hours. According to a Chronicle article: “Their antics caused one man to miss the birth of his son, another group to miss a family funeral, and who knows how many others to miss planes or arrive late for important business or medical appointments.”

One driver filed a class-action lawsuit and state Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco authored a bill in 1997 that was signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson that increased the maximum fine for trespassing on the bridge from $1,000 to $10,000 and doubled maximum jail time from six months to a year. Since then, fewer daredevils have sought their 15 minutes of fame on the Golden Gate Bridge.
