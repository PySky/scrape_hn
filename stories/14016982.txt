In our rich-text editor (used in Firefox for designMode and 

contenteditable), when the user hits Enter, we have historically always 

inserted a <br>.  This does not match any other browsers, which use <p> or 

<div> as line separators.  In bug 1297414, I'm changing our behavior to use 

<div> as a line separator.  This matches Blink/WebKit. 

 

So if you have the text "foobar" and hit Enter in between the "foo" and the 

"bar", previously you would get "foo<br>bar", and soon you will get 

"<div>foo</div><div>bar</div>".  The defaultParagraphSeparator command can 

be used to change the separator to "p" instead (which matches Edge's 

default behavior last I checked). 

 

Pages or embedders that want to keep the old behavior can run the following 

command: document.execCommand("defaultParagraphSeparator", false, "br"). 

 

This change is not likely to affect high-profile sites that use rich-text 

editing (webmail etc.), because due to browser incompatibility, these sites 

all override this behavior anyway. 

 

Our new behavior is as specified in the essentially unmaintained editing 

specification that I wrote several years ago, and tested by the 

web-platform-tests editing suite.  (Except that the "br" value to 

defaultParagraphSeparator is unspecified, and is a Mozilla-specific 

extension for backwards compatibility.)
