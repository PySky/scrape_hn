Much like the slow parenting movement gained traction in select communities several years ago, I believe we’re going to see the rise of the slow startup movement. The slow startup movement isn’t about growing slow, as the definition of a startup is a scalable, growth-focused company. Rather, it’s about taking a simpler, more flexible approach to building a successful business.

The slow startup values freedom and flexibility over marketshare.

The slow startup favors the long-term over the short-term.

The slow startup eschews venture capital in favor of customer-funded growth.

The slow startup doesn’t read TechCrunch and the glorification of raising money.

The slow startup plans for the next 20 years, not an exit in 3-5 years.

The next time someone says you have to grow faster, have to raise money, have to win the market, know that there’s a different way with plenty of success stories: the slow startup way. Go slow and win your own way.
