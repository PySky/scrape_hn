There's no doubting that Elon Musk has a unique mind-set that drives his incredible success. Where exactly did he get it?

You might cite nature, believing he simply won the genetic lottery, or you might guess nurture, arguing he must have been brought up in an extraordinary way. Certainly, those factors influence us all. But that's not how Musk and those closest to him tell it. Ask them how Elon Musk learned to be Elon Musk and they'll usually offer the same response -- he read a lot of books.

His mother, for instance, recounted this anecdote from his childhood to The New Yorker: "Elon would accompany me to dinner parties if I didn't have a date. I'd bring him to meet some interesting adults, and he'd hide a book under the table to read if they weren't interesting enough."

"He would go through two books in one day," reports his younger brother.

Even Musk himself has often discussed his voracious reading. When asked how he learned enough about rockets to start SpaceX, for example, he responded simply, "I read a lot of books."

Which isn't to say that simply reading the same books as Musk will turn you into a super-entrepreneur and daring dreamer like him. That would be silly. But if you want to be a little more Musk-like in your thinking, then these titles, all recommended by Musk and helpfully rounded up by Quora users, probably aren't a bad place to start:|||
