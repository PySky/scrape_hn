Version 1.9 fixes a subtile bug in version 1.7 in the handling of LOOP/REP instructions that was found by user Sotek. It also adds a bunch of enhancements suggested by Christoph Groth such as: a better color coding algorithm, multiple color coding algorithms (right click to change), left click to save genome under cursor (although this doesn't work all that well unless you are quick), and some speed optimizations. Cells with generations less than 2 are also no longer shown, which removes a lot of background noise from the visualization and permits the emergence of order to be seen more clearly.

Version 1.7 adds many improvements including the Mersenne Twister random number generator (which is much faster and has a much longer period), more statistics, probabilistic permission behavior, and a slightly different instruction set. This instruction set implements the SHARE instruction developed by Christoph Groth and documented in this blog entry. It also implements KILL, which is a variation of the old EAT instruction. So, in a sense, it is a hybrid between Christoph Groth's SHARE contribution and the original EAT mechanism. This permits both symbiotic behavior and predation. Version 1.7 exhibits even more striking behaviors than version 1.0. Read the source for even more changes and more details.

Version 1.0 is the original version and is the smallest and simplest. It is kept here for historical reasons.|||
