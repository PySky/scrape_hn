Make it easy for your subscribers to forward that amazing email to their friends.

1. In your emails (not on your website) add a simple link "mailto:?subject=paste encoded subject here&body=paste encoded body here" so that your readers can easily click and it`ll make a new templated email for them to send to a friend.

2. Take the text you want for your subject and your body and separately drop them into Eric Meyer`s handy free URL Encoder.
