Anecdotally, it’s known that most startups fail. But looking at the data, we can see the hard truth in the numbers and better understand where in the funding lifecycle startups begin to lose traction.

We followed a cohort of over 1,000 startups from the moment they raised their first seed investment to see what happens to them empirically.

So, once you take your first bit of seed funding, what can startup founders expect? The data bears out the conventional wisdom: Just over 70% of startups stall at some point in the VC process and fail to exit or raise follow-on funding.

Of the 1,098 tech companies we tracked that raised seed rounds in the US in 2008-2010, less than half, or 46%, managed to raise a second round of funding. Every round sees fewer companies advance toward new infusions of capital and (hopefully) larger outcomes. Only 14% of our companies went on to raise a fourth round of funding, which typically corresponds to a Series C round.

The data below gives a more detailed look at the outcomes.
