While playing and riding rented bicycle, we never bothered to wear helmets. We played Oware, Ampe, Kwaakwaa (Hide and seek) asosor, tumatu  (Ghanaian games) and skipping rope etc, without thinking about television, video or computer games.

We were happy after our fufu, kokonte, etsew, ampesi,

They just searched for and gave only love. They were proud to see us around them. These days parents are chasing after money and riches that they ignore the presence of their kids.

We used to go to our friends' home unannounced and enjoyed food with them. We never had to call them and ask for their parents' permission to visit their home.

We might have been in Black and White photos but you find colorful memories in them.|||
