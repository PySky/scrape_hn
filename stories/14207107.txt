Antbleed is a backdoor introduced by Bitmain into the firmware of their bitcoin mining hardware Antminer.

The firmware checks-in with a central service randomly every 1 to 11 minutes. Each check-in transmits the Antminer serial number, MAC address and IP address. Bitmain can use this check-in data to cross check against customer sales and delivery records making it personally identifiable. The remote service can then return "false" which will stop the miner from mining.

The patch was introduced here (pastebin) and can be seen in the source: here (github)|||

Bitmain has installed a backdoor in many Antminer devices that illegally transmit personally identifying information (serial number + mac address) to the remote system. This allows Bitmain to identify machines according to sales and delivery records.
