In the model below, we're predicting whether one or more clandestine graves will be discovered. Known graves are necessarily a subset of all graves because there are certainly graves that are not discovered. Therefore it is possible that there are graves with different perpetrators or different causes that would not be predicted by this model. This means, for example, that if only predictions like these were used to drive future searches for graves, then itâ€™s possible (even likely) to miss graves that are unlike those that have been found before but are probably still out there.

This is an epistemological challenge. The interesting question is "where are the hidden graves?" But what the model answers is "in which counties will we discover graves that are like the graves we have found in the past?"

In this context, similarity --- graves like the ones we have found in the past --- means that the social production of knowledge about the graves found in the past will be similar to graves found in the future. The question of "findability" should therefore be central to thinking about these results. How were these graves found? Is there something about these counties, or these graves, which makes them findable, while other graves remain unfindable? Do these graves hold the victims of perpetrators who share some methods, while other perpetrators are more successful at hiding graves? We do not address those questions here.

The very high precision in the prediction may mean that counties in which graves become known are wildly different values on many variables relative to the counties which are thought to have very low probabilities of graves. This provides a direction for future research; more on this below.|||
