In September 2011, in response to the Office of Management and Budget releasing a list of all federal executive domains, I built a small tool called Site Inspector and created a quick analysis of the technology and capabilities that power each federal domain.

Nearly three years later, I resurrected that tool, albiet a bit smarter, and, using the latest list, thought I’d take a look at how things have changed in the time since. Efforts like the Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy have surely moved the needle, right? RIGHT?!

Math’s never been my strong point, so I highly encourage you to check my work. You can browse the full results at dotgov-browser.herokuapp.com or check an individual site (.gov or otherwise) at gov-inspector.herokuapp.com.

A quick analysis of the technology and capabilities that power each federal domain such as non-www, SSL, and IPv6 support, or what server/cms they use
