Use the advice from industry experts to get some traction

While working on the beta version of Standuply, we faced many challenges in attracting early adopters. We reached out to bot experts and ran our own research to answer this question. Today I’d like to share some of the data we gathered and insights of other Slack bot builders.

Prior any marketing activity, your main goal should be understanding your target audience in order to serve them better. It is a well covered topic in many articles and books, but I will highlight the key points from domain experts:

In addition to establishing contact with your target audience you may want to reach out to the influencers and talk with them about getting their feedback, help or just to get to know the community better. There is a great article by Robert Hopman (@roberthopman) covering this topic which also covers other aspects of attracting customers to your Slack bot: http://puuush.com/funnel/the-beginning-of-slack-bot-marketing/.

While working on your bot, don’t just develop and deploy, but be proactive and communicate your bot’s value with your target audience and Slack community. I found it is useful and exciting — while looking for insights to share you may find something really valuable to your product. Once you prepare material and share it with others not only do you start promoting your brand but you build a community tied to your product.

In order to help you with creating content here are several useful links to use:

Once you have your landing page it’s time to add it to startups catalogs to get traction. I believe in the 80/20 rule, and I suppose 80% will come from Betalist and Producthunt (Crunchbase, Angellist and https://news.ycombinator.com are must-haves as well) but in order to get as much attention as possible, here is the list of other catalogs as well.

Also we’re listing catalogs related to bots only, most of them have low traffic but they’ve very relevant and could certainly grow into a more substantial ‘bot store’:

Producthunt is one of top drivers of customers to your Slack bot. According to Matty Mariansky (@mmatty) post https://medium.com/building-the-robot-assistant/our-first-week-on-the-slack-platform-8d5a996f6bb6#.aeqt1j4ld we can see that the amount of traffic from Producthunt is almost the same comparing to Slack directory (at the peak).

For the details of launch on Producthunt you can read post by Marwaan Al Saadi (@marwannas) of his experience publishing Birdly: https://medium.com/inside-birdly/600-upvotes-later-the-story-of-our-product-hunt-launch-6c088d7ec584#.3u1viqskb

As we can see the first impression on Producthunt is very important so polish the website having a clear message what do you do, run product tests with the help of early adopters and make sure everything is brilliant. Notify your community, but instead of sending a direct link to your page on Producthunt, send a link to the main page. Otherwise you`ll be dragged down, here is the the information on the Producthunt algorithm: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/36hu8f/product_hunts_secret_algorithm_trick_xpost_from/

V. Strive to be listed in the Slack directory

Of course it should be a goal for every Slack bot creator to be listed in the Slack directory and we’re on our way towards it, so I will share our own experience later but here’s what other have to say:

Here are couple of great guides how to prepare your bot for Slack directory submission:
