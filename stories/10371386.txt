I have a Lumia 950 and Microsoft wireless display adapter. Continuum is very, very buggy and has very few apps (less than 10) that work on it. I'd recommend folks wait until the software and apps mature.|||

Microsoft recently announced the new Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL handsets. These new powerful phones also come with support for Continuum bringing the PC experience to the phone, and today we get to know how the feature works.
