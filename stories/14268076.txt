If you’re running web applications on the Internet, then you’re almost certainly seeing probes for the Struts 2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638).

Contrast Security is just like you, and we are seeing these attacks against our servers too.  Since the announcement last month, we have been blocking attacks numerous times, every day, from places like Hong Kong, Shandong, Bangalore, and many other places around the world.

As I sit and watch these attacks happening, I can’t help but feel all warm and cozy inside. Contrast automatically detects and blocks attacks like Struts 2 and other vulnerabilities in open source components. Contrast also blocks bots, manual attacks, even attacks against totally unknown vulnerabilities in your applications.

I want to help you with your application security program. You don’t have to live with ‘solutions’ cobbled together from a variety of tools that are more work than they’re worth. There is no reason why you shouldn’t be able to instantly:
