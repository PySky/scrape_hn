Several families exist, but some major ones are rubber dome switches, membrane switches and mechanical switches. Some switches can be hybrids merging technologies from different families. On rubber dome switches, each key is place above a rubber dome that, when the key is pressed, deforms and touches the board below, closing the circuit and registering the signal. Membrane switch keyboards typically have two membrane sheets placed over each other and the signals are sent when they come in contact wich each other on certain points: this contact is caused by the pressed key’s pressure. Mechanical switches are individually composed by a housing that lodges a stem, a spring and contact points. When the keys are pressed, the stem comes down and allows the contact points to contact each other, sending the signal. Note that this mechanism means that the key doesn’t need to be pressed all the way down to register. This allows typing to be less tiresome and more agile, fast and reliable. For this reason, many people prefer mechanical switches over the alternatives.|||
