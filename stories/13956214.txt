Given an undirected graph, print all Hamiltonian paths present in it. Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once.



 For example, below graph shows a Hamiltonian Path marked in red.

The idea is to use backtracking. We check if every edge starting from an unvisited vertex leads to a solution or not. As Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once, we take help of visited[] array in proposed solution to process only unvisited vertices. Also we use path[] array to stores vertices covered in current path. If all the vertices are visited, then Hamiltonian path exists in the graph and we print the complete path stored in path[] array.
