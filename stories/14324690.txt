Embeddinator-4000 is a tool to turn existing .NET libraries into libraries that can be consumed by other languages.

It is a tool that takes a .NET assembly and generates the necessary glue to surface the .NET API as a native API. The goal is to surface .NET libraries to all ecosystems where Mono/Xamarin run, and for each platform we provide an interface that is native to that platform as well as the tools needed to turn a .NET library into something that can be consumed on that platform.

This is a work in progress, the initial goals for this project are to surface .NET to C, C++, Objective-C (across the various Apple platforms) and Java (Android and regular Java).

Clone this repository and initialize/update submodules as well as solution depends on them.

Open the solution in with Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio and press F7.

To generate bindings for a managed library you invoke the command line tool.

Important: please follow the instructions in 's README to use the new and improved Objective-C generator (will eventually fusion with .

If you do not pass any arguments, you will get a list of the tool options:

To generate C bindings for a assembly you would call the tool like:|||
