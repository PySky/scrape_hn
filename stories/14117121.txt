Mark your calendars for Snap, Inc.’s first-ever Q1 2017 earnings call on Wednesday, May 10, at 1.30pm Pacific time / 4.30pm Eastern time after the public market closes.

The camera company that went public on March 2, 2017 (we wrote about behind-the-scenes Snapchat IPO story by Evan Spiegel’s fiancee Miranda Kerr before) will report its earnings and provide major updates to its investors. Snap, Inc. will host a live broadcast of the earnings call on  at 4:30 PM Eastern time.

Even before the company went public, investors expressed concerns about the company’s slowdown in user growth in the second half of 2016 when Facebook started rolling out more Snapchat-like features. The highly anticipated call is likely to provide details on the company’s user growth and engagement, its offering for advertisers and major product feature updates.

Snap, Inc.’s stock opened at NYSE at $24 per share on March 2, 2016.
