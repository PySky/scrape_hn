NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES (APRIL 10, 2017) (NEW YORK GOVERNOR’S OFFICE) – New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill in New York City on Monday (April 10) that ends imprisoning people younger than 18 with adults.

A $163 billion state budget passed on Sunday (April 9) that includes raising the age of criminal responsibility and free tuition for students from families earning less than $120,000 a year – were pushed by Cuomo and led to the longest budget delay since the Democrat took office in 2011.

To be phased in through October 2019, people under the age of 18 will no longer be housed in adult jails and prisons.

The measure, strongly embraced by Assembly Democrats, will leave North Carolina as the only state to automatically prosecute and imprison 16 and 17-year-olds as adults regardless of the crime.

State residents with household incomes under $100,000 will be able to enroll in state public colleges tuition-free. The income limit rises to $125,000 in three years.|||
