We've seen that a complex exponential is not distorted when being transmitted over the channel. Hence, we can encode information in the amplitude of a complex exponential and look at the received amplitude, to recover the information: Let $A$ be the information we want to transmit, we could send $x(t)=A\exp(j2\pi ft)$ over the channel. At the receiver, we have $$y(t)=A\cdot H(f)\cdot\exp(j2\pi ft).$$ When we know $H(f)$, i.e. the channel frequency response at frequency $f$, we can calculate the information $A$.

Even more, different frequencies do not interfer with each other. So let's transmit two different pieces of information $X_1,X_2$ using two different frequencies $f_1,f_2$:

Even more, let's transmit not only two different pieces of information, but many. For each information, we use a different frequency, and denote the information on frequency $f$ by $X(f)$. Since we can transmit on any frequency, the transmit signal can be written as

For each frequency $f$, we transmit the information $X(f)$ on the complex exponential $\exp(j2\pi ft)$. You see, this is exactly the inverse Fourier Transform.

At the receiver side, the received signal becomes

from which we actually want to obtain the amplitudes of the different frequency components $X(f)H(f)$. What do you do to obtain the information about the frequency components of a signal? Right, you perform Fourier Transform, which leads to

because $X(f)H(f)$ is the amplitude of the frequency component with frequency $f$. We have essentially derived the convolution theorem.

What's the problem with this approach? Well, the involved signals are infinitely long. So, in order to demodulate the signal, you'd need to wait infitinely long. Clearly, that's not a practical solution.|||
