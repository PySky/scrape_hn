The High-Performance Computing Module (HPC Module) for SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) is now available for 64-bit ARM (AArch64) systems.

My colleague, Kai Dupke, stated in his blog Making HPC Adoption Easier that the goal of providing a select set of packages in the HPC Module instead of in the base SLES operating system is to more quickly respond to the rapidly evolving packages in the upstream community.

The HPC community is undergoing a rapid transformation to faster innovation and easier to install tools because of the open collaboration provided by the OpenHPC project. SUSE is a founding member of the OpenHPC community and has worked with OpenHPC and our partners to support OpenHPC for X86-64 and ARM-processor based systems.

In addition to traditional, scientific computing workloads, we are seeing many companies creating HPC environments for data analytics and other business-focused workloads. These companies do not have an extensive team to maintain those environments and have a need for commercial support for their HPC software.

This is where SUSE Linux Enterprise High Performance Computing Module can help. The packages included in the HPC Module are fully supported by SUSE under the base SUSE Linux Enterprise subscription.

Currently, the SLES 12 HPC Module includes these packages:

The HPC Module is delivered as an add-on product to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. To install the HPC Module for SLES 12 SP2, follow these steps:

We are still quite early in the history of the SLES HPC Module. Now that we have completed the initial mechanics of delivering the HPC Module for both X86-64 and 64-bit ARM architectures, we expect to be able to deliver additional packages and updated packages more rapidly than. was previously possible.|||
