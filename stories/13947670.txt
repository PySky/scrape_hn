If your account has two-factor authentication enabled, you will be prompted for a code when you run the script.

Two-factor authentication will expire after an interval set by Apple, at which point you will have to re-authenticate. This interval is currently two months.

NOTE: Using the system keyring to store your iCloud password is not supported, because this is an automated script. Just provide your iCloud password by using the option.

The first time you run the script, you will probably see an error message like this:

This error usually means that Apple's servers are getting ready to send you data about your photos. This process can take around 5-10 minutes, so please wait a few minutes, then try again.|||
