Amazon has closed my account (Prime member since 2012) without any warning or reason. All I have been told is "We took these actions to comply with US export laws and regulations. This will be the final communication in this matter." I am an Amazon consumer (not seller) and I do not re-sell or export anything I purchase on Amazon... Since Amazon has removed my account, I've lost all access to my account on all devices: 1) All photos uploaded to my "Unlimited Prime Photos" storage 2) Order history is entirely inaccessible. I cannot access receipts for warranties or reimbursement. 3) I've lost all my digital Kindle content 4) My dash buttons don't work 5) My Amazon store credit card is useless|||
