Generate mazes of different shapes and arbitrary sizes

Maze generator can create rectangular, hexagonal, honeycomb and circular mazes. Maze generation can be done using Kruskal's algorithm, depth-first search or breadth-first search. Mazes can be rendered in svg or png format (using gnuplot as intermediate in the latter case).

Maze generator uses gnuplot (with a system call ) to render png mazes. So make sure that is installed with terminal support and is in the path if you wish to use png.

The code is written in C++ 11, you will need a not-too-ancient C++ compiler to build it.

The arcs in the circular mazes are plotted as parametric curves in gnuplot, and png can take quite long to render for large mazes.|||
