It is my pleasure to announce that a feature-complete Spring Framework 5.0 release candidate is available now! We are expecting a further release candidate at the end of May and a final release in late June at this point.

As a major revision of the core framework, 5.0 RC1 comes with a Java 8+ baseline and many infrastructure refinements: e.g. our own Commons Logging bridge autodetecting Log4j 2, SLF4J, JUL by default; streamlined use of Servlet 3.1+; and early support for JUnit 5.0 M4.

Once again, here are the major Spring Framework 5 feature themes:

P.S.:

For some background on Spring 5’s reactive programming story with Project Reactor and its Reactive Streams foundation, I highly recommend Rossen’s recent InfoQ podcast.

Also, stay tuned for the first Spring Boot 2.0 milestone, due early next week, building on Spring Framework 5.0 RC1 and a couple of portfolio releases to happen in the meantime…|||
