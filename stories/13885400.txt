Metabase is a brilliant visualization layer for your databases that lets your team learn from data by creating beautiful dashboards, sharing insights and easily answering questions in just a few clicks (oh, and it also supports integrations with Google Analytics, Vertica and a million other sources). With the option to use SQL for tricky questions and the various visualizations supported, we absolutely love this open-source tool.

Hasura is the easiest way to deploy Metabase using its Docker image. Let’s see how to do that in two steps.

Every Hasura project comes bundled with a ready-to-use PostgreSQL instance with a JSON HTTP API based data service built on it. To create a project, head to beta.hasura.io (you can check out our 7-day free-trial or install Hasura on your own infrastructure).

Any docker image can be deployed as a service on a Kubernetes cluster using the Hasura project console.

Create a new custom service in the project console. Configure the service with a name (the service is also deployed under a subdomain with the same name) and the Docker image details (port no. 3000). That’s it, just hit ‘Create’, and voilà, Metabase is up and running! Hit the service’s external endpoint and see for yourself.|||
