We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Yahoo! Inc., which we refer to as Yahoo or the Company, which will be held at the Santa Clara Marriott, located at 2700 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California, on June 8, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time.

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to authorize the proposed sale, which we refer to as the sale transaction, of Yahoos operating business to Verizon Communications Inc., which we refer to as Verizon, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2016, as amended as of February 20, 2017, between Verizon and Yahoo, which we refer to as the Stock Purchase Agreement. Specifically, under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to sell to Verizon all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo, which we refer to as Yahoo Holdings, and prior to the sale of Yahoo Holdings to cause Yahoo Holdings to sell to a foreign subsidiary of Verizon all of the equity interests in a newly formed foreign subsidiary of Yahoo Holdings that will hold certain foreign subsidiaries relating to Yahoos operating business, following the transfer to Yahoo Holdings of all of the assets and liabilities relating to our operating business, other than specified excluded assets and retained liabilities, as set forth in the Reorganization Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2016, as amended as of February 20, 2017, between Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, which, together with the Stock Purchase Agreement, we refer to as the sale transaction agreements. The purchase price that Verizon will pay or cause to be paid in the sale transaction is $4,475,800,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments.

Upon completion of the sale transaction, our remaining assets will consist solely of the excluded assets, which include cash and marketable debt securities, our shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited, our shares in Yahoo Japan Corporation, certain other minority equity investments, and Excalibur IP, LLC (a subsidiary of ours that owns a portfolio of non-core patent assets), and our remaining liabilities will consist solely of the retained liabilities, which include our 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, securityholder litigation, 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by the Company, and certain director and officer indemnification obligations. Following the closing, the Company will continue to be a Delaware corporation publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, but will be renamed Altaba Inc. and trade under the ticker symbol AABA. Because our assets will then consist primarily of our equity investments, short-term debt investments, and cash, upon the closing we will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Importantly, the completion of the proposed sale transaction will not affect your shares of Yahoo common stock, which will continue to represent shares of common stock of the Company after it has registered as an investment company.

Based upon, among other considerations, a recommendation by an independent committee of our Board of Directors called the Strategic Review Committee, our Board of Directors has (i) determined that the sale transaction agreements and the sale transaction are expedient and for the best interests of Yahoo and its stockholders, (ii) approved the sale transaction agreements and the sale transaction, and (iii) directed that the sale transaction be submitted for consideration by the stockholders at the special meeting. Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the sale transaction.

Following the completion of the sale transaction, the Company will amend the indemnification and exculpation provisions of its certificate of incorporation in order to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940. Approval of the proposal to authorize the sale transaction will also constitute stockholder approval of this amendment.

The enclosed proxy statement additionally requests stockholder approval of (i) on a non-binding, advisory basis, executive compensation described in the enclosed proxy statement that may be paid or become payable as

a result of the proposed sale transaction and (ii) the grant of authority to our Board of Directors to postpone or adjourn the special meeting for up to 10 business days to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of the sale transaction, if our Board of Directors determines in good faith that such postponement or adjournment is necessary or advisable to obtain stockholder approval of the sale transaction or to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which our Board of Directors has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders prior to the special meeting. Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR these additional proposals.

We encourage you to read the enclosed proxy statement and the annexes and exhibits to the proxy statement, including Annex 1, which contains information about the Company after it registers as an investment company, carefully in their entirety.

Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares you own. We cannot complete the sale transaction unless it is approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote thereon. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, you are urged to submit your proxy as soon as possible electronically over the Internet, by telephone, or, if you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, by marking, signing, and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the envelope provided today. No postage need be affixed if the proxy card is mailed in the United States. Submitting a proxy will not limit your right to attend the special meeting.

Thank you for your continued support.

Very truly yours,

Chairman of the Board of Directors

The attached proxy statement is dated April 24, 2017 and is first being mailed on or about April 28, 2017 to Yahoo stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2017.

To Be Held on June 8, 2017

The proxy statement accompanying this notice, including its annexes and exhibits, contains additional information with respect to the business to be transacted at the special meeting of Yahoo stockholders, which we

refer to as the special meeting. We urge you to read the proxy statement, including the documents incorporated by reference, and its annexes and exhibits carefully and in their entirety.

Based upon, among other considerations, a recommendation by a special committee of the Board called the Strategic Review Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, the Board has (i) determined that the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction are expedient and for the best interests of Yahoo and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction and (iii) directed that the Sale Transaction be submitted for consideration by the stockholders at the special meeting.

The Board recommends that Yahoo stockholders vote FOR each of the Sale Proposal, the Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal.

Stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2017, which we refer to as the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 958,131,387 shares of Yahoo common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. We have no other class of stock outstanding.

Your vote is very important. We cannot complete the Sale Transaction without the approval of the Sale Proposal. Approval of the Sale Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote thereon. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote at the special meeting. However, the stockholder vote regarding the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote, and therefore is not binding on us, the Board, our compensation committee, or Verizon. Since the compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided in connection with the Sale Transaction are based on the terms of the Sale Transaction Agreements or contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments and these payments may still be made even if our stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the Compensation Proposal.

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please submit your voting instructions by calling the toll-free telephone number or by using the Internet as described on the enclosed proxy card (or, if you received the proxy statement by electronic mail, as described in that email). If you received this proxy statement by physical mail, you may also vote by completing, signing, and dating the accompanying proxy card and returning it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If your shares are held in street name through a broker, bank, or other nominee, please follow the instructions furnished by your broker, bank, or other nominee.

By Order of the Board of Directors,

This proxy statement constitutes a proxy statement under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

You should rely only on the information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement. No one has been authorized to provide you with information that is different from the information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement. This proxy statement is dated April 24, 2017. You should not assume that the information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement is accurate as of any date other than that date (or, in the case of incorporated documents, their respective dates). Our mailing of this proxy statement to Yahoo stockholders will not create any implication to the contrary.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE SALE TRANSACTION

The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Yahoo, may have regarding the Sale Transaction and the other matters being considered at the special meeting as well as answers to those questions. Yahoo urges you to read carefully the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the Sale Transaction and the other matters being considered at the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes and exhibits to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Where You Can Find Additional Information.

Approval of the Compensation Proposal and approval of the Adjournment Proposal each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Companys stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

Note, however, that the vote on the Compensation Proposal will be advisory only and will not be binding. Since the compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided in connection with the Sale Transaction are based on the terms of the Sale Transaction Agreements or contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect our obligation to make these payments.

As discussed in What effect do abstentions and failures to vote have on the proposals? below, failure to instruct your broker or nominee to vote will have the same effect as votes AGAINST the Sale Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

Failures to Vote. If you are a stockholder of record and you fail to vote, it will have the same effect as voting AGAINST the Sale Proposal, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

If you hold your shares in street name, it is critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote if you want your vote to be counted at the special meeting. Brokers are not permitted to exercise discretionary authority regarding any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of Yahoo stock and you fail to instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee how to vote, it will have the same effect as votes AGAINST the Sale Proposal, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

Yahoo does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. A broker non-vote occurs on an item when (i) a broker, bank, or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on at least one routine proposal at a meeting, but under stock exchange rules is not permitted to vote on other non-routine proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) that beneficial owner fails to provide such instructions. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at our special meeting are routine matters, Yahoo does not expect any broker non-votes at this special meeting.

All attendees will be asked to present a government-issued photo identification, such as a drivers license or passport, and must meet the following requirements for admission:

If you do not provide a government-issued photo ID and comply with the other procedures outlined above, you will not be admitted to the special meeting. Note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment, smartphones or other similar equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases, or packages may not be allowed (or their use may be restricted) in the special meeting room.

Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, Yahoo will effect the Charter Amendment and will change its name to Altaba Inc. and be a publicly traded, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. After the closing, the Fund will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol AABA. Importantly, however, the completion of the Sale Transaction will not affect your shares of Yahoo common stock, which will continue to represent shares of common stock of the Fund after it has registered as an investment company. Yahoo stockholders will not receive any shares of Verizon common stock and will not retain any continuing interest in the Business following completion of the Sale Transaction, other than in connection with the RSU Substitution. Following completion of the Sale Transaction, the Funds remaining assets will consist solely of the assets excluded from the Sale Transaction, including its cash and marketable debt securities, its shares in Alibaba (held directly and indirectly), its shares in Yahoo Japan, certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity in Excalibur (which owns the Excalibur IP Assets), and the Funds remaining liabilities will consist solely of the liabilities retained in the Sale Transaction, including the Convertible Notes, securityholder litigation, 50 percent of certain cash liabilities related to the Data Breaches, and certain director and officer indemnification obligations. Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Business will be owned and operated by Verizon, and the Fund will have no interest in, and will receive no income from, the Business.

Though the Company will become an investment company following the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will differ from most investment companies, including in the following ways:

This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements concerning the Sale Transaction, Yahoos expected financial performance, Yahoos strategic and operational plans, and the Fund. These statements can, in some cases, be identified by the use of terms such as may, will, should, could, would, intend, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, project, potential, or continue, the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology. Risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. There is no assurance that the Sale Transaction will be completed in a timely manner or at all. In addition, the anticipated benefits of the Sale Transaction may not be realized. Potential risks and uncertainties related to the Sale Transaction include, among others:

All of these risks and uncertainties could potentially have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance, and could cause our stock price to decline.

Forward-looking statements concerning the Fund may include information such as the Funds plans, strategies, and goals and the Funds beliefs and assumptions concerning future economic and other conditions and the outlook for the Fund, based on currently available information and the fact that, following the closing of the Sale Transaction, the Company will be required to register and be regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act, which will result in, among other things, the Company having to comply with the regulations

thereunder, certain stockholders potentially being prohibited from holding or acquiring shares of the Company, and the Company likely being removed from the Standard and Poors 500 Index and other indices which could have an adverse impact the Companys share price following the Sale Transaction.

More information about other potential factors that could affect Yahoos business and financial results is included under the captions Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Yahoos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is on file with the SEC and available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

This section contains information about the special meeting of stockholders of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo, the Company, we, or us) that has been called to consider and vote on the Sale Proposal, the Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal (each as defined in Purpose below), which we refer to as the special meeting. This proxy statement is being furnished to Yahoo stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Yahoo for use at the special meeting and for any postponements or adjournments of the special meeting. This proxy statement provides Yahoo stockholders with information about the special meeting and should be read carefully in its entirety.

The special meeting will be held at the Santa Clara Marriott, located at 2700 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California, on June 8, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time.

At the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

Throughout this proxy statement, we refer to the Original Stock Purchase Agreement and the Original Reorganization Agreement, together, as the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, we refer to the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment and the Reorganization Agreement Amendment, together, as the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments, and we refer to the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement, together, as the Sale Transaction Agreements.

Business may be conducted at the special meeting only if a quorum is present or represented by proxy at the meeting, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote must be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. Abstentions are counted to determine whether a quorum is present. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Questions and Answers About the Special Meeting and the Sale TransactionThe Special MeetingWhat effect do abstentions and failures to vote have on the proposals? for more information.

If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the special meeting, the chairperson of the special meeting is authorized by our bylaws to adjourn the meeting without the vote of the stockholders.

Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo is required to obtain approval of the Sale Transaction by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting, and such stockholder approval is a condition to the completion of the Sale Transaction. In addition, Yahoo entered into a settlement agreement with Starboard Value LP (Starboard) and certain of its affiliates, dated April 26, 2016 (the Starboard Settlement Agreement), pursuant to which Yahoo is required to submit the Sale Proposal to Yahoo stockholders for approval. Additionally, pursuant to Delaware law, Yahoo is required to obtain approval of the Charter Amendment by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve the Compensation Proposal. The stockholder vote regarding the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote, and therefore is not binding on us, the Board, our compensation committee, or Verizon. Since the compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided in connection with the Sale Transaction generally are based on the terms of the Sale Transaction Agreements or contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments, and these payments may still be made even if our stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the Compensation Proposal.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.

You are urged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting. The Board recommends that Yahoo stockholders vote FOR each of the Sale Proposal, the Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal.

As of the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 8.9 percent of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock.

Stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2017, which we refer to as the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 958,131,387 shares of Yahoo common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. We have no other class of stock outstanding.

At the special meeting, you will have one vote for each share of our common stock you own as of the close of business on April 20, 2017.

As of the record date, there were approximately 8,533 record holders of our common stock (which amount does not include the number of stockholders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, or other nominees, but instead includes all such institutions as one holder).

There are four ways to vote:

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. It is recommended that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting. You may change your vote at the special meeting. If a proxy is signed and returned by a record holder without indicating any voting instructions, the shares of Yahoo common stock represented by the proxy will be voted FOR the approval of the Sale Proposal, the approval of the Compensation Proposal, and the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

If you submit a proxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the aforementioned proposals.

If you fail to respond, your shares will not be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum, and your failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the Sale Proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

The granting of proxies electronically is allowed by Section 212(c)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

If you are a beneficial owner holding shares in street name, you should follow the directions your broker provides you regarding how to vote your shares or when granting or revoking a proxy.

A broker is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on routine matters without instructions from the beneficial owner of those shares. On the other hand, a broker is not entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on non-routine items absent instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. Each of the proposals to be considered and voted on at the special meeting (namely, the Sale Proposal, the Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal) are considered non-routine items. Consequently, if you hold shares in street name and you do not submit any voting instructions to your broker, your broker will not vote your shares on any of the proposals. If this occurs, it will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the Sale Proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

If your shares are held in street name, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote those shares at the meeting using the ballot provided at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the special meeting.

You may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:

For shares you hold in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee or by obtaining a legal proxy from your broker, bank, or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

The Board has appointed Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to serve as the inspector of election for the special meeting. The inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the number of shares of Yahoo common stock represented at the special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum, determine the validity of all proxies and ballots, and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to Yahoo stockholders.

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Yahoo. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (Innisfree), a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related services, for a fee estimated to be approximately $25,000 plus an amount to cover expenses. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Innisfree against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement. In addition to the mailed proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. Our directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We will also reimburse brokerage firms, banks, and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.

Before deciding whether to vote for the proposals discussed in this proxy statement, you should carefully read and consider the following risk factors associated with the Sale Transaction and ownership of the Companys common stock following the Sale Transaction. You should also carefully read and consider the other information included and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the matters addressed in the section of this proxy statement entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, as well as the information set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Yahoos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is available on the United States Securities and Exchange Commissions (the SEC) website at www.sec.gov.

The amount of net proceeds that Yahoo will receive is subject to uncertainties.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the amount of net proceeds that Yahoo will receive from Verizon is subject to uncertainties by virtue of the purchase price adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Verizon will pay or cause to be paid to Yahoo, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings and the shares of Foreign SaleCo transferred in the Foreign Sale Transaction, an aggregate base cash purchase price equal to $4,475,800,000, less any applicable withholding taxes. This base purchase price will be subject to an adjustment based on the net working capital, cash, and debt of Yahoo Holdings and the other subsidiaries of Yahoo (subject to exceptions) as of the opening of business on the date of the closing, certain transaction expenses, and certain changes in the aggregate value of outstanding unvested Yahoo restricted stock unit awards (each, a Yahoo RSU award) between the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement and the closing. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementPurchase Price.

The implementation of the Sale Transaction will require significant time, attention, and resources of our senior management and others within Yahoo, potentially diverting their attention from the conduct of Yahoos business.

Yahoo will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Sale Transaction.

Yahoo has incurred, and expects to incur, significant non-recurring costs associated with the Sale Transaction. These costs and expenses include financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting, and other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, severance and employee benefits-related expenses, public company filing fees and other regulatory expenses, printing expenses, and other related charges. Through the date of this proxy statement, Yahoo has incurred aggregate transaction costs of approximately $51.5 million in connection with the Sale Transaction. Based on information available as of the date of this proxy statement, Yahoo anticipates incurring additional transaction costs of approximately $46.8 million in connection with the Sale Transaction, most of which are contingent upon the completion of the Sale Transaction. Some of these costs are payable by Yahoo regardless of whether the Sale Transaction is completed.

Yahoo will be subject to business uncertainties while the Sale Transaction is pending.

Uncertainties about the completion or effect of the Sale Transaction may affect the relationships between Yahoo and its existing and potential advertisers, suppliers, customers, vendors, distributors, landlords, licensors, licensees, joint venture partners, and other business partners, and may have an adverse effect on Yahoo. These uncertainties may cause Yahoos advertisers, suppliers, customers, vendors, distributors, landlords, licensors, licensees, joint venture partners, and other business partners to seek to change existing business relationships with Yahoo, to forego new relationships, or to enter into alternative agreements with Yahoos competitors because business partners may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable. If Yahoo fails to complete the Sale Transaction, the failure to maintain existing business relationships, including pursuant to a

termination or modification of such relationship, or to enter into new business relationships could adversely affect Yahoos business, revenues, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the market price of its common stock. Additionally, Yahoo may be required to obtain consent from certain of these business partners in connection with the Sale Transaction. There is no assurance that such consents will be obtained, and the pursuit of such consents may disrupt Yahoos ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Sale Transaction.

In addition, Yahoo is dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of its key management personnel and other key employees to operate its business and execute its business plans. Current and prospective employees of Yahoo may experience uncertainty about their roles within Yahoo prior to and following the completion of the Sale Transaction, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of Yahoo to attract or retain key management personnel or other key employees. If key employees depart because of issues related to this uncertainty or a desire not to remain with Yahoo, Yahoos business could be negatively impacted. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Yahoo will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees to the same extent that Yahoo has previously been able to attract or retain key management personnel or other key employees.

Yahoo cannot participate in a superior proposal for the Business unless Yahoo pays the termination fee to Verizon.

The Stock Purchase Agreement requires Yahoo to pay Verizon a termination fee equal to $134,274,000 (the Termination Fee), if, subject to certain requirements set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated prior to the closing by Verizon as a result of the Board changing its recommendation with respect to the Sale Transaction or by Yahoo in order to accept an unsolicited acquisition proposal that the Board determines to be a superior proposal. These provisions may discourage a third party from submitting a strategic proposal to Yahoo during the pendency of the proposed Sale Transaction as well as afterward, should the Sale Transaction not be completed, that might result in greater value to Yahoo than the Sale Transaction. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementNo Solicitation; Superior Proposal; Termination Fee.

Yahoo will be subject to certain other contractual restrictions while the Sale Transaction is pending.

The Stock Purchase Agreement restricts Yahoo from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, and taking other specified actions until the earlier of the completion of the Sale Transaction or the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement. These restrictions may prevent Yahoo from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Sale Transaction and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementConduct of Business by Yahoo and the Business Subsidiaries Prior to the Closing.

Yahoo could suffer adverse effects that could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Sale Transaction.

Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the Sale Transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Sale Transaction or termination of the Sale Transaction Agreements.

Yahoos directors and executive officers may have interests in the Sale Transaction that are different from or in addition to those of Yahoo stockholders generally.

Our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the Sale Transaction Agreements. A special committee of the Board consisting entirely of independent directors (which was authorized by the Board to consider and evaluate possible strategic transactions involving a sale, merger, investment, or other similar transactions related to the Business, which we refer to as the Strategic Review Committee), and the Board

recommended that Yahoo stockholders vote in favor of the proposals set forth in this proxy statement. These directors and executive officers may have interests in the Sale Transaction that are different from or in addition to those of Yahoo stockholders generally. These interests include, among others, the fact that, upon the closing of the Sale Transaction, Yahoo RSU awards held as of immediately prior to the closing by employees of Yahoo Holdings (or a subsidiary thereof), who will automatically become employees of Verizon (or a subsidiary thereof) immediately following the closing, generally will be replaced with cash-settled Verizon restricted stock unit awards (each, a Verizon RSU award). Yahoo RSU awards held by Yahoo non-employee directors and individuals who are employees of the Fund as of immediately following the closing will not be replaced with Verizon RSU awards and will instead vest in full in accordance with the terms of the applicable Yahoo equity plan governing such awards. In addition, all Yahoo stock options outstanding immediately prior to the closing will, if not already vested, become fully vested, effective as of the closing, and all Yahoo stock options will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. The Fund, following the closing, will retain all liabilities and obligations with respect to all Yahoo stock options and all Yahoo RSU awards held by non-employee directors and individuals who are employees of the Fund immediately following the closing. In addition, executive officers may become entitled to severance payments and benefits in the event their employment with Verizon terminates for certain qualifying reasons following the closing. On March 10, 2017, Thomas J. McInerney, the Chairman of the Strategic Review Committee, entered into an offer letter with the Company, effective upon the closing of the Sale Transaction, pursuant to which Mr. McInerney will become the Chief Executive Officer of the Fund upon the closing of the Sale Transaction and, in such capacity, will receive compensation from the Fund. See the section of Annex 1 of this proxy statement entitled Management of the FundCompensation of Officers and Directors. The Strategic Review Committee and the Board were aware of these interests when they determined that the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction are expedient and for the best interests of Yahoo stockholders and recommended that Yahoo stockholders approve the Sale Proposal. Yahoo stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider the recommendations of the Board that they vote in favor of the Sale Proposal. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Sale Transaction.

Certain litigation has been initiated related to the Sale Transaction, and Yahoo may be exposed to additional litigation related to the Sale Transaction from our securityholders or from third parties.

Transactions such as the Sale Transaction are often subject to lawsuits by securityholders. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Legal Proceedings for a description of certain pending litigation related to the Sale Transaction. Yahoo may become subject to additional litigation related to entering into or failing to complete the Sale Transaction, including direct actions by Yahoo securityholders against the directors and/or officers of Yahoo for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty or derivative actions brought by Yahoo stockholders in the name of Yahoo. Notwithstanding completion of the Sale Transaction, any liabilities arising out of actions by Yahoo securityholders will be retained by Yahoo. Additionally, Yahoo may become subject to additional litigation by third parties related to the Sale Transaction, including actions brought by persons with other business relationships with Yahoo. Lawsuits by securityholders and/or third parties could result in substantial costs and divert our Boards and our managements attention from other business concerns.

The opinions of the Strategic Review Committees financial advisors will not be updated to reflect changes in circumstances between the date such opinions were delivered and the completion of the Sale Transaction.

Yahoo has not obtained updated opinions from the financial advisors to the Strategic Review Committee as of the date of this proxy statement, and Yahoo does not anticipate asking the Strategic Review Committees financial advisors to update their opinions. Changes in the operations and prospects of Yahoo, general market and economic conditions, and other factors that may be beyond Yahoos control, and on which the Strategic Review Committees financial advisors opinions were, in part, based, may significantly alter the information contained in such opinions by the time the Sale Transaction is completed. The opinions do not speak as of the time the Sale Transaction will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. The Boards recommendation, however, is as of the date of this proxy statement. For a description of the opinions that the Strategic Review Committee received from its financial advisors, see the sections of this proxy statement entitled

Proposal 1The Sale TransactionOpinions of the Financial AdvisorsOpinion of Goldman Sachs, Proposal 1The Sale TransactionOpinions of the Financial AdvisorsOpinion of J.P. Morgan, and Proposal 1The Sale TransactionOpinions of the Financial AdvisorsOpinion of PJT Partners.

Holders of Yahoo common stock will not have appraisal or dissenters rights in connection with the Sale Transaction.

Neither Delaware law nor the Existing Charter provides Yahoo stockholders with appraisal or dissenters rights in connection with the Sale Transaction.

Risks Related to Failure to Complete the Sale Transaction

The Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Sale Transaction may not be completed.

The completion of the Sale Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementConditions to the Completion of the Sale Transaction. These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Sale Transaction may not be completed. In addition, if the Sale Transaction is not completed by July 24, 2017, either Yahoo or Verizon may choose not to proceed with the Sale Transaction, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the completion of the Sale Transaction, before or after the required Yahoo stockholder approval. In addition, each of Yahoo and Verizon may elect to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement in certain other circumstances. If the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated, Yahoo may incur substantial fees in connection with termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement (including, in certain circumstances, the payment of the Termination Fee) and will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the Sale Transaction. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementTermination of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

Termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement could negatively impact Yahoo.

If the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Sale Transaction is not completed, the ongoing business of Yahoo may be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Yahoos business may be impacted by having foregone other strategic opportunities during the pendency of the Sale Transaction, the failure to obtain the anticipated benefits of completing the Sale Transaction, changes to existing business relationships caused by uncertainties pending the Sale Transaction, payment of certain costs relating to the Sale Transaction, and the attention, time, and resources of our senior management and other employees devoted to the Sale Transaction, diverting their attention from the conduct of our business. In addition, if the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Yahoo may be required to pay the Termination Fee or up to $15,000,000 in expense reimbursements to Verizon (which is creditable toward the Termination Fee), depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementNo Solicitation; Superior Proposal; Termination Fee. Yahoo may also be negatively impacted if the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated and the Board is unable to execute an alternative strategic transaction, including, for example, a reverse spin-off transaction, offering equivalent or more attractive benefits than the benefits to be provided in the Sale Transaction.

Prior to the completion of the Sale Transaction, Yahoo may dispose of assets that are currently contemplated to be held by the Fund immediately after the closing.

Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo is generally permitted to seek to sell, and to sell, any of the assets that are excluded from the Sale Transaction without the consent of Verizon and without paying any termination fee or other amount to Verizon. Although Yahoo has no current intention of selling, prior to the

closing of the Sale Transaction, any of the assets that are not included in the Sale Transaction, Yahoo reserves the right to sell any such assets prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction. There is no assurance that the Funds assets held immediately after the completion of the Sale Transaction (the Initial Assets) will consist of all of the assets described above. For additional information about the Funds Initial Assets, please refer to the section in Annex 1 to this proxy statement entitled Pro Forma Schedule of Investments. There is also no assurance as to the value of the consideration Yahoo might receive in the event of any such disposition. Additionally, Yahoo and the Board reserve the right to distribute any of its cash to investors prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction through repurchases of its common stock or outstanding debt securities or distributions.

Failure to complete the Sale Transaction could cause Yahoos stock price to decline.

The failure to complete the Sale Transaction may create doubt as to the value of the Business and about Yahoos ability to effectively implement its current business strategies and/or a strategic transaction, which may result in a decline in Yahoos stock price.

Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, Yahoos remaining assets will consist solely of the assets excluded from the Sale Transaction, including, among others, Yahoos cash and marketable debt securities, Yahoos shares in Alibaba (held directly and indirectly), Yahoos shares in Yahoo Japan, certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity in Excalibur IP, LLC (Excalibur), which owns a portfolio of patent assets that are not core to Yahoos operating business (the Excalibur IP Assets), and Yahoos remaining liabilities will consist solely of the liabilities retained in the Sale Transaction, including, among others, Yahoos 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 (the Convertible Notes), securityholder litigation, 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to the Data Breaches (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1Sale Transaction OverviewThe Sale Transaction), and certain director and officer indemnification obligations. Because Yahoos assets will then consist primarily of Yahoos equity investments, short-term debt investments, and cash, Yahoo, which will change its name upon the closing to Altaba Inc., will be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Throughout this proxy statement, we refer to Yahoo after its registration as an investment company as the Fund.

Following the closing of the Sale Transaction, the Funds share price will be materially impacted by the value of the Funds investment assets.

Following the closing of the Sale Transaction, the market price of the Funds shares will be materially impacted by the value of the Funds investment assets. It is anticipated that, as of the closing, these investment assets would include its shares in Alibaba (held directly and indirectly), its shares in Yahoo Japan, certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity in Excalibur (which owns the Excalibur IP Assets). These investment assets may decline in value.

Following the Sale Transaction, the Fund will be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act.

Following completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will register, and be regulated, as an investment company under the 1940 Act. For information regarding the regulation of the Fund under the 1940 Act, see the section in Annex 1 to this proxy statement entitled Regulation under the 1940 Act. Annex 1 includes a description of the Fund, including its investment objective and policies, anticipated operating expenses, regulation, risks, pro forma financials, and other relevant information. You should read Annex 1 carefully so that you understand the risks relating to your investment in the Fund following the completion of the Sale Transaction.

Certain stockholders may be prohibited from holding or acquiring shares of a registered investment company.

The Fund will operate as a registered investment company regulated under the 1940 Act following the completion of the Sale Transaction. A stockholder may be prohibited from holding or acquiring shares of a

registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act, other laws and regulations, or other investment policies that may be applicable to the stockholder. You should consult with your own professional advisors as to the legal, tax, financial, or other matters relevant to the suitability of an investment in the Fund following the Sale Transaction.

The 1940 Act generally prohibits any investment company and any company controlled by an investment company from acquiring in the aggregate more than three percent of the total outstanding voting stock of a registered investment company. In addition, a registered investment company and any company controlled by an investment company may not, in the aggregate, invest more than five percent of its total assets in the securities issued by any one registered investment company or more than 10 percent of its total assets in all other investment companies. In addition, the investment objectives and policies of some investment companies may prohibit them from owning securities in the Fund. For example, an index fund that invests in Yahoo common stock because it is included on an index tracked by the index fund may not be permitted to own shares of the Fund following the Sale Transaction. As a result, the Fund may be more likely to trade at a discount to its net asset value and its market price may be more volatile shortly after the Sale Transaction is completed.

It is likely that the Fund will be removed from the S&P 500 stock index and other indices following the completion of the Sale Transaction, which could have an adverse impact on the Funds share price.

Our shares currently are a component of the Standard & Poors 500 Index (S&P 500) and other indices. We believe it is likely that the S&P 500 would remove the Funds shares as a component of the S&P 500 following the completion of the Sale Transaction because, pursuant to the S&P 500 eligibility requirements, closed-end funds are ineligible to be included on the S&P 500. Although we cannot be certain as to when the S&P 500 would take this action, it may be effective immediately following the completion of the Sale Transaction. If the Funds common stock is not included as a component of the S&P 500 or other indices or no longer meets the investment criteria of such index funds, institutional investors that are required to track the performance of the S&P 500 or such other indices or index funds that track those indices would be required to sell their Fund common stock immediately, which could adversely affect the price of the Funds common stock.

The Fund will have discretion in the use of the net proceeds from the Sale Transaction.

If the Sale Transaction is completed, the purchase price will be paid directly to the Company. The Fund currently intends to return substantially all of its cash to stockholders over time through stock repurchases and distributions, although the Fund will retain sufficient cash to satisfy its obligations to creditors and for working capital. The timing and method of any return of capital will be determined by the Board. Stock repurchases may take place in the open market, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans or in a tender offer, or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured and derivative transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions. The Fund currently anticipates that the amount of cash to be retained by the Fund will be at least $1.4 billion, which is the minimum amount necessary to satisfy the Funds obligations under the Convertible Notes. However, the Funds obligations to creditors and working capital requirements may vary over time and may be materially greater than such amount, depending upon, among other factors, the cost of cash-settling any conversion obligations under the Convertible Notes, the Funds potential obligations with respect to other Retained Liabilities (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled The Sale Transaction Agreements  The Reorganization Agreement  Retained Liabilities), and whether the income from the Funds investments is sufficient to cover its expenses.

For additional risks relating to the Fund following the closing, see the section in Annex 1 to this proxy statement entitled Risk Factors.

The following chronology summarizes certain key events and contacts that led to the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement. It does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, the Strategic Review Committee, members of Yahoos management or their respective representatives, and other parties.

In April 1996, Yahoo signed a joint venture agreement with SoftBank Group Corp. (SoftBank), as amended in September 1997 and June 2015, pursuant to which Yahoo Japan was formed. Yahoo Japan, which is incorporated in Japan, provides a wide range of online services to Internet users in Japan, from search and information listing to community and e-commerce. As of June 30, 2016, Yahoo owned approximately 36 percent of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Japan, which are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

On October 23, 2005, Yahoo acquired approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alibaba, which represented approximately 40 percent on a fully diluted basis, in exchange for $1.0 billion in cash, the contribution of Yahoos China-based businesses, and direct transaction costs of $8 million. Alibaba, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is an online and mobile commerce company. Alibabas businesses are comprised of core commerce, cloud computing, mobile media and entertainment, and other innovation initiatives. Alibabas core commerce business is comprised of marketplaces operating in three areas: retail commerce in the Peoples Republic of China; wholesale commerce in the Peoples Republic of China; and international and cross-border commerce. On September 18, 2012, pursuant to the terms of a repurchase agreement between Alibaba and Yahoo, Alibaba repurchased 523 million of the 1,047 million ordinary shares of Alibaba owned by Yahoo for approximately $7.1 billion in total consideration. Approximately $6.3 billion of the consideration was received in cash and $800 million was received in Alibaba Preference Shares, which Alibaba redeemed for cash on May 16, 2013. On September 24, 2014, Alibaba closed its initial public offering of American Depositary Shares, each of which represents one ordinary share of Alibaba (Alibaba ADS and, together with ordinary shares of Alibaba, Alibaba Shares). Pursuant to the terms of the repurchase agreement, Yahoo sold 140 million Alibaba Shares in the initial public offering and Yahoo received approximately $9.4 billion in cash (net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and fees of approximately $115 million). Following completion of the sale in Alibabas initial public offering, Yahoo retained 383,565,416 Alibaba ordinary shares, representing approximately 15 percent of Alibabas outstanding ordinary shares.

For a number of years prior to the execution of the Sale Transaction Agreements, in furtherance of its continuing efforts to maximize stockholder value, the Board explored, together with Yahoos management and assistance from a number of internationally recognized investment banks, law firms, and accounting firms, various alternatives with respect its equity stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, including both tax-efficient and taxable options for monetizing such equity interests. Based on the relative market prices of Alibaba, Yahoo Japan, and Yahoo, as well as Yahoos net cash balance, the Board believed that the market was significantly undervaluing Yahoo. The Board believed at that time that separating Yahoos equity stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan from its core operating business would create value by, among other things: providing the investor community with greater clarity and focus with respect to the value of Yahoos operating business; enabling the management of Yahoo to focus exclusively on its operating business; enhancing Yahoos ability to attract, retain, and incentivize management and employees by creating equity-based compensation that more accurately and efficiently reflects the performance of Yahoos operating business; and enhancing Yahoos ability to pursue strategic acquisitions by creating a more efficient equity currency.

As part of Yahoos exploration of ways to efficiently separate its equity interests in Alibaba from its operating business, on January 27, 2015, Yahoo announced a plan for a spin-off, which we sometimes refer to as the Aabaco spin-off, of all of Yahoos remaining holdings in Alibaba into a newly formed independent registered investment company called Aabaco Holdings, Inc. (Aabaco). Under the Aabaco spin-off, the stock of Aabaco was to be distributed pro rata to Yahoo stockholders, resulting in Aabaco becoming a separate publicly traded registered investment company. Upon completion of the transaction, Aabaco would have owned, directly or indirectly, all of Yahoos remaining 384 million Alibaba Shares and a 100 percent ownership interest in Aabaco Small Business, LLC, a newly formed entity which would own Yahoo Small Business, an existing operating business of Yahoo that would also have been transferred to Aabaco as part of the transaction. The transaction was initially to be subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Board, receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) regarding certain aspects of the transaction, and a legal opinion from Yahoos legal counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (Skadden), with respect to the tax-free treatment of the transaction under U.S. federal tax laws and regulations.

In September 2015, the IRS notified a representative of Skadden that it had determined, in the exercise of its discretion, not to grant the ruling requested with respect to certain aspects of the transaction, although the IRS also did not rule adversely on the request. Later that month, the IRS issued a formal no-rule policy (i.e., a

policy of generally not granting a private letter ruling) with respect to certain transactions similar to the Aabaco spin-off and, in a notice released on the same day, indicated that the IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury were studying the possibility of promulgating new guidance with respect to similar transactions in the future.

The Board, which had met and discussed the progress of the Aabaco spin-off numerous times following the initial announcement of the plan, held a meeting on December 2 and 3, 2015 at Yahoos Sunnyvale headquarters to consider recent developments with respect to the Aabaco spin-off and whether to proceed with the transaction. At the meeting, a representative of Skadden confirmed that Skadden expected to be able to deliver a legal opinion as to the tax-free nature of the transaction. Representatives of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (J.P. Morgan), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (BofA Merrill Lynch), which were acting as financial advisors to Yahoo with respect to the Aabaco spin-off, discussed with the Board the markets perception of the tax risk of the Aabaco spin-off, which would likely have impaired the trading price of Aabaco shares until resolved. The financial advisors and Skadden also reviewed potential alternatives to the Aabaco spin-off for separating the Alibaba stake and possibly the Yahoo Japan stake from Yahoos operating business, including a reverse spin-off by Yahoo of its operating business, whereby the operating business would be spun off in a new company and the existing entity would retain its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which would be more complicated to execute than the Aabaco spin-off but would result in significantly lower tax liability than the Aabaco spin-off if both transactions were treated as taxable. After discussion, the Board determined to suspend work on the Aabaco spin-off and to evaluate alternative transaction structures to separate the Alibaba stake, focusing specifically on a spin-off of Yahoos core operating business, which we sometimes refer to as the reverse spin-off.

On December 9, 2015, Yahoo issued a press release announcing the Boards decision to suspend work on the Aabaco spin-off and to evaluate alternative transaction structures to separate the Alibaba stake, focusing specifically on the reverse spin-off.

Following the December 9, 2015 announcement, Yahoos management and advisors continued to evaluate alternative transactions that would separate Yahoos stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan from its operating business.

On January 15, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting with members of management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (Wilson Sonsini), legal counsel to the Board, participating for portions of the meeting. Prior to these advisors joining the meeting, members of management presented and the Board approved a strategic operating plan, an earlier version of which had been discussed at the Boards December 2, 3, and 17, 2015 meetings, designed to simplify Yahoos operating business, narrowing its focus on areas of strength to better fuel growth, drive revenue, and increase efficiency. In addition, representatives of Yahoos financial advisors and Skadden presented the Board with potential strategic alternatives intended to achieve Yahoos objectives of maximizing stockholder value and execution certainty while minimizing time to execution and transaction complexity. The Board and Yahoos advisors discussed, among other factors, the feasibility, potential tax implications, and likely timing of these potential alternatives, focusing primarily on a reverse spin-off of Yahoos operating business and a sale of that business to a third party, including certain variations of these primary alternatives.

Following the January 15 Board meeting and prior to the engagement of the Financial Advisors by the Strategic Review Committee, BofA Merrill Lynch was not requested to, and did not, provide any further financial advice to Yahoo or the Board and its engagement by Yahoo subsequently expired. BofA Merrill Lynch was engaged by Verizon in March 2016 in connection with Verizons participation in the strategic alternatives process described below.

On January 31, 2016, the Board met telephonically, with members of management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini participating. At the meeting, the Board, members of

management and the advisors present at the meeting discussed the strategic alternatives of the reverse spin-off and a sale of Yahoos operating business. The Board also authorized the formation of a special committee of the Board, named the Strategic Review Committee, to be composed of certain independent members of the Board, to

consider and evaluate possible strategic transactions involving Yahoos operating business and all matters pertaining thereto on Yahoos behalf. The Strategic Review Committee was initially composed of Maynard G. Webb, Jr., who served as Chairman, H. Lee Scott, Jr., and Thomas J. McInerney. The Board resolved that it would not approve or recommend to Yahoos stockholders for approval any strategic transaction related to Yahoos operating business without a prior favorable recommendation of such transaction by the Strategic Review Committee. The Strategic Review Committee was further authorized to retain, at Yahoos expense, such outside counsel, financial advisors, and other outside advisors as the Strategic Review Committee deemed appropriate to assist in its prescribed duties.

Following the Board meeting, the Strategic Review Committee retained Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (Cravath) as its legal counsel.

On February 2, 2016, concurrently with its announcement of its quarterly and annual financial results for the periods ended December 31, 2015, Yahoo issued a press release announcing its strategic operating plan, which included exploring certain non-strategic asset divestitures. In that press release, Yahoo also indicated that, in addition to continuing to work on a reverse spin-off transaction, the Board would also explore other strategic alternatives for separating Yahoos operating business from its Alibaba Shares.

In the days following the February 2, 2016 announcement, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, as well as members of the Board and Yahoos management team, received general indications of interest in investments in or acquisitions of all or part of Yahoos operating business from numerous parties, including a senior executive of Verizon approaching Mr. Webb to express Verizons interest in a potential transaction with Yahoo. In addition, after Marissa A. Mayer, Yahoos Chief Executive Officer and President, acting with approval of the Strategic Review Committee, had contacted representatives of both Yahoo Japan and SoftBank, the controlling shareholder of Yahoo Japan, to inform them that Yahoo was exploring strategic alternatives, a senior executive of SoftBank approached Ms. Mayer to request a meeting to discuss a potential transaction involving Yahoo and Yahoo Japan, subject to Yahoo committing to a 30-day exclusivity period. The Strategic Review Committee was kept informed of each of these indications of interest.

On February 4, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Strategic Review Committee their fiduciary duties and other relevant legal considerations, as well as the scope of the authority delegated to the Strategic Review Committee by the Board. The Strategic Review Committee identified a number of investment banks as potential financial advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. Because the parties potentially interested in acquiring Yahoos operating business included financial sponsors, the Strategic Review Committee also advised members of management not to engage in any discussions with interested parties about terms of employment, co-investment, or rollover of equity unless first discussed and authorized by the Strategic Review Committee.

On February 10, February 11, February 12, and February 15, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings, with representatives of Cravath participating, during which the Strategic Review Committee considered whether to engage one or more of the investment banks (including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan) that the Strategic Review Committee had identified as potential financial advisors at its February 4, 2016 meeting and subsequently interviewed. The Strategic Review Committee considered the capabilities and experience of the various candidates that it met and reviewed the disclosures provided by the investment banks regarding certain relationships they had with potential bidders for Yahoo or its assets, Yahoo and other parties with whom Yahoo had significant relationships. After considering the information provided by the investment banks in their disclosures and during their interviews, the Strategic Review Committee decided to engage Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, each of which was familiar with Yahoo based on its prior work for Yahoo, including with respect to the suspended Aabaco spin-off and the potential reverse spin-off, and PJT Partners LP (PJT Partners), which

had not previously worked with Yahoo, as its financial advisors. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and PJT Partners are referred to as the Financial Advisors.

On February 12, 2016, the Board met and discussed the progress of the Strategic Review Committee, including its selection of financial and legal advisors.

After engaging each of the Financial Advisors, the Strategic Review Committee directed the Financial Advisors to begin reaching out to potential interested parties, including those parties that had contacted representatives of Yahoo, Goldman Sachs, and J.P. Morgan about a potential transaction following the February 2, 2016 earnings announcement, to evaluate their interest in a potential transaction involving Yahoo or its assets.

On February 19, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee updated the Board on its progress. Mr. Webb informed the Board that the Strategic Review Committee had met numerous times and explained its recent activities, including the engagement of, and commencement of work with, the Financial Advisors. He also outlined the outreach process, including work underway by management to prepare a management presentation and potential timing for meetings with interested parties.

Also on February 19, 2016, Yahoo issued a press release announcing the formation of the Strategic Review Committee and that the Strategic Review Committee had engaged the Financial Advisors and Cravath as the Strategic Review Committees financial advisors and legal counsel, respectively.

Over the next several weeks, the Financial Advisors communicated with a total of 51 parties to evaluate their interest in a potential transaction. Between February 19 and April 6, 2016, a total of 32 parties signed confidentiality agreements with Yahoo, including 10 strategic parties and 22 financial sponsors. All of these potential bidders received access to a virtual data room, which initially included a management presentation (which included three years of forecasted financial information for Yahoo which had previously been reviewed by the Board) and publicly available documents but was later updated with customary due diligence materials and was further updated regularly throughout the strategic alternatives process in response to due diligence questions and requests from potential bidders.

The Strategic Review Committee discussed the ongoing outreach process with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath at telephonic meetings held on February 25 and March 3, 2016.

On February 25, 2016, Mr. Webb and Ms. Mayer met with representatives of SoftBank. At the February 25 meeting, Mr. Webb and Ms. Mayer received a letter from Yahoo Japan to the Board, dated February 25, 2016, setting forth the material terms of a non-binding proposal for a merger of equals transaction between Yahoo and Yahoo Japan. Yahoo Japans proposal, which was subject to due diligence, negotiation of final documentation, and approval by Yahoo Japans board of directors, contemplated that Yahoos existing stockholders would receive a 50 percent stake in the combined entity and approximately $14.0 billion in cash, reflecting an equity value for Yahoo of $29.05 per fully diluted Yahoo share. Yahoo Japans proposal also contemplated a commitment by Alibaba to purchase approximately 50 percent of Yahoos stake in Alibaba in six equal annual installments over a six-year period commencing one year after the closing of the transaction. The letter was not signed or acknowledged in writing by Alibaba. The letter conditioned further discussions regarding the proposal on Yahoos entry into a 30-day exclusivity agreement on or before March 1, 2016.

On February 26 and February 29, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings, with representatives of Cravath and, for certain portions, certain representatives of one of the Financial Advisors and Ms. Mayer participating, to discuss the non-binding proposal set forth in Yahoo Japans letter. The Strategic Review Committee subsequently received advice with respect to the Yahoo Japan proposal from each of the Financial Advisors. The Strategic Review Committee considered, among other things, the fact that Yahoo

Japans proposal offered no premium for Yahoos shares and that the contemplated repurchase by Alibaba of a portion of its shares would be fully taxable. Members of the Strategic Review Committee also discussed Yahoo Japans proposal, and the Strategic Review Committees views with respect to such proposal, with each other member of the Board. After careful consideration, the Strategic Review Committee concluded that the terms described in Yahoo Japans letter were not compelling and that Yahoo should not enter into the proposed exclusivity agreement, but the Strategic Review Committee would be open to continuing a dialogue with SoftBank and Yahoo Japan about a potential transaction on more attractive terms. After the Strategic Review Committees position was communicated orally to SoftBank by a representative of one of the Financial Advisors, SoftBank and Yahoo Japan each declined to enter into a confidentiality agreement in connection with the strategic alternatives process and did not thereafter participate in such process.

On March 8, 2016, Mr. Scott resigned from the Strategic Review Committee given his other responsibilities, including as Chairman of Yahoos Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. At a Board meeting on the same day, Catherine J. Friedman and Eric K. Brandt were appointed as independent directors of Yahoo to fill vacancies created by the recent resignations of two independent directors. The Board also appointed Mr. Brandt to replace Mr. Scott on the Strategic Review Committee.

On March 9 and March 14, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings and discussed with its advisors the status of the strategic alternatives process. At the March 14 meeting, the Strategic Review Committee also discussed potential approaches to the Excalibur IP Assets in relation to the strategic alternatives process with a view to most effectively monetizing those assets. The Strategic Review Committee subsequently decided to pursue a separate sale process for the Excalibur IP Assets and to permit bidders for Yahoos operating business to participate in the Excalibur IP Assets process as well.

On March 14, 2016, the Board met telephonically, with members of management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Cravath participating, to discuss with members of the Strategic Review Committee the proposed management presentation and forecasted financial information to be included in the presentation.

Between March 18 and April 1, 2016, seven potential interested parties, including Verizon, each attended separate half-day in-person management presentations at Skaddens Palo Alto offices. These potential interested parties were previously selected by the Strategic Review Committee and its advisors as the initial group to receive management presentations based on, among other things, the level of interest they had shown in the process and their perceived viability as potential buyers. The presentations were given by Yahoos management team, including, among others, Ms. Mayer, Ken Goldman (Chief Financial Officer), Ronald S. Bell (then General Counsel and Secretary), and Ian Weingarten (Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Partnerships).

On March 22, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting and reviewed with representatives of Cravath drafts of the engagement letters negotiated with each of the Financial Advisors. Each of the Financial Advisors executed engagement letters with Yahoo, dated March 23, 2016, with respect to its role as a financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee.

On March 22, 2016, the Board met telephonically, with members of management and a representative of Wilson Sonsini participating, to discuss with members of the Strategic Review Committee the management presentations that were recently made to potential bidders.

During the period from March 23 through April 6, 2016, at the direction of the Strategic Review Committee, the Financial Advisors sent process letters to potential bidders that had executed confidentiality agreements. These process letters set forth guidelines for the submission of a preliminary non-binding indication of interest in the acquisition of or strategic investment in one or more of Yahoos assets and established April 11, 2016 as the deadline to submit such preliminary non-binding indications of interest. The process letters noted, among other things, that Yahoo was open to considering proposals for Yahoos operating business or its principal non-operating assets, as well as for the whole company.

On March 24 and March 31, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to discuss, among other things, the in-person management presentations to date and the response of the initial group of potential bidders that attended such presentations. The Strategic Review Committee subsequently decided, in consultation with Yahoos management, that, given the number of additional interested parties and taking into account managements time, an audio recording of the management presentation would be made available to the interested parties that were not invited to attend in-person management presentations.

On March 24, 2016, Yahoo received notice from Starboard of its intention to nominate nine persons, including Tor R. Braham, Eddy W. Hartenstein, Richard S. Hill, and Jeffrey C. Smith, for election to Yahoos Board at its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders and to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of its nominees.

From April 1 through April 8, 2016, a total of 19 interested parties that had signed confidentiality agreements with Yahoo attended audio recorded management presentations at the offices of Cravath, in New York, Skadden, in New York or Palo Alto, or certain of the Financial Advisors offices. All potential bidders who attended either an in-person or audio recorded management presentation were invited to participate in individualized follow-up question-and-answer sessions with Yahoos management team, including Ms. Mayer and Mr. Goldman.

Beginning on April 4, 2016, and on most weekdays thereafter until Yahoo and Verizon entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Strategic Review Committee held a standing daily call with members of Yahoos management team, including Ms. Mayer, Mr. Goldman, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Weingarten, and with representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini.

On April 5 and April 7, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath, and, for the April 7 meeting, Skadden participating, and discussed, among other things, feedback from potential bidders and the process for the Strategic Review Committees review of the initial indications of interest. The Strategic Review Committee decided to extend the due date for preliminary indications of interest to April 18, 2016. At the April 7 meeting, a representative of Skadden also presented potential structures for separating Yahoos operating business from its other assets in connection with a potential transaction. Although the Strategic Review Committee was primarily focusing on the auction process at this time, it was noted that much of the work relating to the potential separation structures would also apply to a reverse spin-off if the Board chose to pursue such a transaction.

Throughout April until April 18, 2016, the potential bidders continued to engage in extensive due diligence discussions with Yahoos management team, with the assistance of the Financial Advisors, and to request and receive due diligence updates to the virtual data room.

On April 11, 2016, a strategic party referred to as Strategic Party A submitted a preliminary non-binding proposal providing for a $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion strategic investment in Yahoo, after which Yahoos operating business would be spun off. After consideration of the proposal and discussion with its advisors, the Strategic Review Committee determined not to pursue it at that time, pending completion of the sale process.

At a Board meeting held at Yahoos Sunnyvale headquarters on April 13 and April 14, 2016, members of the Strategic Review Committee and representatives of the Financial Advisors updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives process. The Board also discussed with Skadden and Cravath the proposed transaction structure of a sale of Yahoos operating business.

On April 18, 2016, 14 parties (in addition to Strategic Party A), including three strategic bidders and 11 financial sponsor bidders, submitted preliminary non-binding indications of interest with respect to a transaction

with Yahoo. Ten of these proposals contemplated an acquisition of Yahoos operating business on a cash-free, debt-free basis (alone or in conjunction with certain of Yahoos other assets) for enterprise values as follows:

The remaining four indications of interest included:

None of the initial indications of interest received in the process contemplated an acquisition of Yahoo in its entirety.

Between April 18 and April 21, 2016, at the direction of the Strategic Review Committee, representatives of the Financial Advisors contacted the potential bidders, including Verizon, that had submitted proposals contemplating an acquisition of Yahoos operating business on a cash-free, debt-free basis to clarify the terms of, and to obtain additional information with respect to, their proposals.

Between April 19 and April 21, 2016, each of the Financial Advisors provided the Strategic Review Committee with updated disclosures regarding certain of its relationships with the potential bidders.

On April 20 and April 21, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to review and evaluate the first-round proposals and to discuss which bidders would be invited to the next round of the strategic alternatives process. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with members of the Strategic Review Committee their fiduciary duties and other relevant legal considerations. Representatives of the Financial Advisors presented to the Strategic Review Committee their preliminary financial analyses of the initial indications of interest and described their discussions with each potential bidder, including their views on each bidders financial capacity to close a transaction, industry experience, level of engagement in the process, and other factors affecting whether to invite such bidder into the next round of the process. The Strategic Review Committee also determined not to pursue

any of the initial indications of interest contemplating alternative transaction structures, which involved additional complexities and contingencies, concluding that pursuing a sale of Yahoos entire operating business through a competitive auction process offered a better chance of maximizing value for Yahoo stockholders and noting the potential to revisit such proposed alternative structures in the future.

Following the Strategic Review Committee meeting on April 20, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee and representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participated in a call with members of Yahoos management team to discuss the first-round proposals and the Strategic Review Committees analysis of these proposals and to obtain managements input.

On April 21, 2016, Yahoo entered into a purchase agreement to sell the Excluded Real Estate. Yahoo completed the sale of the Excluded Real Estate for total proceeds of $246 million, net of closing costs of $4 million, on June 16, 2016.

On April 22, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management and representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini participating, during which members of the Strategic Review Committee and representatives of its advisors discussed with the other directors the first-round proposals and the Financial Advisors presented preliminary financial analyses of Yahoo and its assets.

Later on April 22, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee had a meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, and Skadden participating. The Strategic Review Committee decided to invite into the next round of the process nine bidders that had submitted initial indications of interest: Verizon, Strategic Party B, the Sponsor C / Sponsor D bidding group, Sponsor A, Sponsor B, a bidding group consisting of Sponsor E and Sponsor F, which, at the recommendation of the Strategic Review Committee to enable them to submit a more competitive bid, were working together, Sponsor G, Sponsor H, and Sponsor I. On behalf of the Strategic Review Committee, the Financial Advisors invited these bidders into the next round of the strategic alternatives process.

From April 23 until July 18, 2016, numerous due diligence meetings and calls were held among representatives of Yahoo and its advisors, the potential bidders, including Verizon, and their advisors, and the Strategic Review Committees advisors. During this period, additional documents were posted to the virtual data room, including in response to potential bidders due diligence requests.

On April 26, 2016, Yahoo entered into the Starboard Settlement Agreement with Starboard and certain of Starboards affiliates to settle the proxy contest pertaining to the election of directors at Yahoos 2016 annual meeting. Pursuant to the Starboard Settlement Agreement, the Board appointed Messrs. Braham, Hartenstein, Hill, and Smith to the Board effective April 26, 2016, and Yahoo agreed to nominate the Starboard designees for election to the Board at the 2016 annual meeting. Also pursuant to the Starboard Settlement Agreement, Mr. Smith was appointed to the Strategic Review Committee in place of Mr. Webb, and Mr. McInerney became chair of the Strategic Review Committee. However, as provided by the Starboard Settlement Agreement, Mr. Webb was invited to continue to attend, and participate in, all Strategic Review Committee meetings. Thereafter, Mr. Webb attended most meetings of the Strategic Review Committee. The Starboard Settlement Agreement also required Yahoo to submit to a stockholder vote any decision recommended by the Strategic Review Committee and approved by the Board to sell Yahoos operating business or any similar transaction.

Between April 28 and May 17, 2016, representatives of each of the remaining potential bidders, including Verizon, and their advisors participated in meetings with Yahoos management, including Ms. Mayer, Mr. Goldman, Mr. Bell, Lisa Utzschneider (Chief Revenue Officer), and Mr. Weingarten, at its Sunnyvale headquarters as part of their due diligence. Also during this period, certain bidders, including Verizon, requested and subsequently participated in calls and meetings with representatives of Yahoo, Skadden, and Cravath to discuss issues related to legal and financial considerations with respect to the transaction, including considerations relating to Yahoos capitalization structure.

On May 2, 2016, at Verizons request, Mr. Webb met with Lowell McAdam, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Verizon. During the meeting Mr. McAdam discussed Verizons interest in a potential transaction involving Yahoos operating business. Mr. Webb suggested that Verizon raise any specific issues with the Strategic Review Committee and its advisors.

On May 5, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, and Skadden participating, during which the representatives of Skadden and Cravath reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee the key proposed terms of the initial drafts of the purchase agreement and reorganization agreement prepared by Skadden in consultation with Cravath.

On May 11, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, during which the representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee revised drafts of the purchase agreement and reorganization agreement prepared by Skadden, and the Strategic Review Committee discussed the timeline for the next round of the process, including a potential interim bid date of June 6, 2016.

On May 12, 2016, after the Strategic Review Committee interviewed several prospective intellectual property advisors and discussed them with members of Yahoos intellectual property team and Mr. Bell. Yahoo, on behalf of the Strategic Review Committee, entered into an engagement letter with Black Stone IP, LLC as an advisor in connection with a possible transaction to monetize the Excalibur IP Assets, either with a buyer of Yahoos operating business or another third party.

Also on May 12, 2016, initial drafts of the purchase agreement and the reorganization agreement were made available to potential bidders through the virtual data room. To minimize the liabilities that would be retained by Yahoo post-closing, the initial draft purchase agreement was structured similar to a typical purchase agreement in a public company acquisition, with no post-closing indemnity by Yahoo and limited closing conditions. In addition, the initial draft purchase agreement provided, in the case of a strategic buyer, that Yahoos unvested employee equity awards would be assumed or substituted for comparable buyer equity awards, and, in the case of a financial sponsor buyer, that these awards would be accelerated at closing. The draft purchase agreement also provided that Yahoo would be required to pay the buyer a termination fee equal to 2.5 percent of the base purchase price if, among other reasons, the purchase agreement was terminated by the purchaser after the Board changed its recommendation for the transaction or by Yahoo to accept a superior proposal (the Yahoo termination fee), and, in the case of a financial sponsor buyer, that Yahoo would be entitled to a reverse termination fee equal to 7.5 percent of the base purchase price if the buyer did not consummate the transaction as a result of its debt financing not being available (the reverse termination fee), and to specific performance if the buyers debt financing was available.

On May 13, 2016, the Financial Advisors provided each of the nine remaining bidders with a process letter setting forth the process and guidelines for the submission of interim non-binding proposals for the acquisition of Yahoos operating business and establishing June 6, 2016 as the due date for interim proposals. The process letter instructed bidders to submit as part of their interim proposals a list of the key issues they had identified in the draft transaction agreements. Bidders were instructed to assume that the transaction would exclude the Excalibur IP Assets and that any sale of the Excalibur IP Assets would be subject to a royalty-free license to the Excalibur IP Assets solely for the benefit of Yahoos operating business.

On May 19, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to discuss the feedback received from bidders and to receive an update on the ongoing due diligence process.

Between May 20 and May 30, 2016, representatives of Cravath, Skadden, and the Financial Advisors participated in calls with representatives of certain of the remaining bidders, including Verizon, and their

respective legal counsel, to discuss their approach to the ongoing strategic alternatives process and the transaction agreements. The representatives of the Strategic Review Committees advisors and Skadden stressed that, in addition to focusing on value, the Strategic Review Committee was seeking proposals that would provide high certainty of closing and leave the post-closing entity with limited liabilities unrelated to the assets retained by Yahoo.

During the week of May 23, 2016, with the approval of the Strategic Review Committee, representatives of each of Verizon and Strategic Party B met separately with Yahoos management team, including Ms. Mayer, Mr. Goldman, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Weingarten, at its Sunnyvale headquarters to discuss potential revenue and cost synergies as part of their due diligence investigation.

On May 24, May 26, and May 27, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held telephonic meetings, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to discuss the progress of the strategic alternatives process and feedback received from the bidders.

On May 31, 2016, the Board held a meeting, with members of management and representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini participating, at which the Board received an update on the strategic alternatives process, including the key terms of the initial drafts of the purchase agreement and reorganization agreement, the status of the bidders due diligence, and the proposed schedule for the remainder of the strategic alternatives process. They also described the status of a process to potentially sell the Excalibur IP Assets.

Also on May 31, 2016, Yahoo and Excalibur entered into a patent assignment, pursuant to which, among other things, Yahoo assigned to Excalibur all right, title, and interest to the Excalibur IP Assets. Concurrently, Yahoo and Excalibur entered into a patent license agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Excalibur granted to Yahoo and certain affiliates a non-exclusive license under the Excalibur IP Assets solely for the Yahoo operating business.

Between May 23, 2016 and June 2, 2016, representatives of Sponsor G, Sponsor H, and Sponsor I communicated to representatives of the Financial Advisors that they were withdrawing from the process.

On June 2, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to discuss the process for review of the second-round bids due on June 6, 2016.

On June 3, at Sponsor Bs request, Mr. Webb met with representatives of Sponsor B. During the meeting the representatives of Sponsor B discussed Sponsor Bs interest in a potential transaction involving Yahoos operating business. Mr. Webb suggested that Sponsor B raise any specific issues with the Strategic Review Committee and its advisors.

On June 6, 2016, Yahoo received non-binding interim proposals to acquire Yahoos operating business, including lists of the key issues identified in the draft transaction agreements, from each of Verizon, Strategic Party B, the Sponsor C / Sponsor D bidding group, Sponsor A, Sponsor B, and the Sponsor E / Sponsor F bidding group. The six interim proposals included the following base purchase prices and key terms, among others:

Between June 6 and June 8, 2016, representatives of the Financial Advisors had numerous discussions with the six bidders who submitted second-round proposals to clarify the terms of and obtain additional information with respect to their proposals, including the reasons for any significant changes from the valuations they had provided in their initial indications of interest.

On June 8, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee met, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to review the interim proposals, including the bidders issues lists and the additional feedback received from the bidders, and to discuss next steps. Representatives of the Financial Advisors provided an overview of the second round of the strategic alternatives process and provided their preliminary financial analyses of the interim proposals. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee the transaction agreement issues lists submitted by the bidders. The Strategic Review Committee preliminarily decided that, because the price offered by the Sponsor C / Sponsor D bidding group was significantly lower than the prices indicated in the other bidders proposals, and representatives of the Sponsor C / Sponsor D bidding group had indicated that they did not expect further due diligence or partnering opportunities would meaningfully change their valuation, the Sponsor C / Sponsor D bidding group would not be invited to the next round of the strategic alternatives process.

On June 9, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee and representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participated in a conference call with Mr. Webb, certain members of Yahoo management, including Ms. Mayer and Mr. Bell, and representatives of Skadden and Wilson Sonsini to review the interim proposals.

On June 10, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting, including certain members of management, to discuss the interim proposals and other matters discussed at the Strategic Review Committees June 8, 2016 meeting. Representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, and Skadden provided the Board with an overview of the interim proposals and the Financial Advisors presented their analyses of each of the bids. Following the Board meeting, and taking into account the Boards discussion and direction, the Strategic Review Committee decided to invite to the next round of the strategic alternatives process each of the remaining five bidders: Verizon, Strategic Party B, Sponsor A, Sponsor B, and the Sponsor E / Sponsor F bidding group. At the Strategic Review Committees direction, the Financial Advisors communicated the Strategic Review Committees decision to the bidders and began to arrange calls to provide the bidders and their advisors with feedback on their transaction agreements issues lists.

On June 12 and 13, 2016, Yahoo uploaded revised transaction agreements and draft disclosure schedules, respectively, to the virtual data room, reflecting the corporate structure of Yahoo Holdings.

On June 13, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, to discuss the bidders ongoing due diligence requests and discuss certain issues relating to the transaction agreements.

Between June 13 and June 19, 2016, representatives of Skadden and Cravath held conference calls with representatives of each of the remaining bidders, including their legal advisors, during which the representatives of Skadden and Cravath provided feedback to each of the bidders on the transaction agreement issues lists they had submitted with their interim bids. The Strategic Review Committees advisors also advised the bidders that mark-ups of the transaction agreements would be due on June 20, 2016, and, for financial bidders, near-final drafts of debt commitment letters would be due on June 30, 2016.

On June 16, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors and Cravath participating, at which the Financial Advisors updated the Strategic Review Committee on, among other things, the feedback received from each of the bidders regarding remaining due diligence items and their expected timing for completion of their due diligence review. The Strategic Review Committee expressed a desire for bidders to be guided to submit final mark-ups of the transaction agreements that would enable Yahoo to be in a position to enter into definitive transaction agreements with the winning bidder as soon as possible after final bids were received.

Between June 20 and June 24, 2016, each of the remaining five bidders submitted initial mark-ups of the transaction agreements. Verizons mark-up of the purchase agreement improved certain of the terms previously indicated in the issues list it submitted on June 6, 2016. In particular, Verizons mark-ups did not contemplate indemnification for breaches of representations, warranties, and pre-closing covenants under the purchase agreement (although it did include indemnification for pre-closing taxes) and provided that Verizon would assume the full cost of unvested Yahoo RSU awards. The mark-ups submitted by Strategic Party B, Sponsor A, Sponsor B, and Sponsor F were generally consistent with the key issues lists previously submitted by those bidders.

On June 24, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, and Skadden participating, to discuss issues raised by the transaction agreement mark-ups the bidders had submitted. The Strategic Review Committee also discussed the timeline for the remainder of the sale process.

On June 21, 2016, principals of Sponsor E and Sponsor F informed Mr. McInerney and representatives of one of the Financial Advisors that Sponsor E intended to withdraw from the auction process, but that Sponsor F continued to be interested in acquiring Yahoos operating business and wished to remain in the process. In the following days, members of the Strategic Review Committee and representatives of the Financial Advisors had numerous discussions with principals of Sponsor F to discuss whether it was feasible for Sponsor F to obtain equity financing without Sponsor Es participation. Based on these discussions, the Strategic Review Committee ultimately determined to permit Sponsor F to remain in the process.

Between June 26 and July 1, 2016, representatives of Skadden, Cravath, and the Financial Advisors participated in conference calls with representatives of each of the five remaining bidders to provide them with initial feedback on their mark-ups of the transaction agreements submitted the previous week, as well as to obtain clarification from the bidders with respect to certain of their changes to the initial drafts.

On June 27, 2016, at the direction of the Strategic Review Committee, representatives of the Financial Advisors distributed to the five remaining bidders a process letter setting out the process and guidelines for the submission of final acquisition proposals and establishing July 18, 2016 as the final bid deadline. The process letter provided for submission of interim mark-ups of the transaction agreements on July 6, 2016, and, based on feedback to be provided by Skadden and Cravath on such interim mark-ups, the submission of final mark-ups of the transaction agreements on July 14, 2016. The process letter further requested that the bidders submit executed debt and equity financing commitment letters (if applicable) with their final proposals, and noted that the Strategic Review Committee would attach considerable importance to the certainty of the financing commitments in its evaluation of the final proposals.

On June 27, 2016, at Verizons request, members of the Strategic Review Committee, together with a representative of one of the Financial Advisors, met with Mr. McAdam and other members of Verizons management team to discuss Verizons participation in the sale process and Verizons interest in a potential transaction involving Yahoos operating business.

On June 29, 2016, the Board held a meeting at Yahoos Sunnyvale headquarters, with members of management and representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini present, to discuss, among other things, the strategic alternatives process. At the meeting, members of the Strategic Review Committee reviewed the interim proposals received from the five continuing bidders, and the Financial Advisors presented the Board with a comparison of the financial aspects of the bids, as well as their preliminary financial analysis with respect to Yahoos operating business, including the relative advantages and disadvantages, as well as the expected timing, of a reverse spin-off compared to a sale of Yahoos operating business. The representatives of Cravath and Skadden reviewed with the Board potential issues raised by the bidders mark-ups of the transaction agreements. A representative of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the Boards fiduciary duties and other legal considerations. The Board also expanded the Strategic Review Committees authority, by authorizing it to consider, evaluate, and make recommendations to the Board regarding the potential monetization of the Excalibur IP Assets, consideration of a reverse spin-off, capitalization and initial investment objectives of Yahoo following a sale of its operating business or a reverse spin-off, the disposition of the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares, and the repatriation of cash to Yahoos stockholders.

Yahoo held its annual stockholders meeting on June 30, 2016. At the annual meeting, Yahoos stockholders elected each of Yahoos director nominees to the Board.

On July 1, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of its advisors and Skadden participating, to review the discussions held with the bidders regarding their initial transaction agreement mark-ups, as well as the status of the bidders due diligence review and the financial sponsor bidders progress in securing equity and debt financing commitments.

On July 6, 2016, Yahoo received interim mark-ups of the transaction agreements from Verizon, Strategic Party B, Sponsor A, and Sponsor F. In its interim transaction agreement mark-ups, Verizon further improved the terms of its bid by, among other things, eliminating the pre-closing tax indemnity (with certain exceptions) and lowering the Yahoo termination fee from 4.0 percent to 3.5 percent. The transaction agreement mark-ups from Strategic Party B, Sponsor A, and Sponsor F that submitted interim mark-ups at that time were generally less favorable to Yahoo than Verizons mark-ups on non-price terms, including indemnification, closing conditions, the Yahoo termination fee, and, where applicable, the reverse termination fee.

On July 7 and July 11, 2016, representatives of Skadden and Cravath held telephonic meetings with representatives of each of the four bidders that had submitted interim mark-ups on July 6, 2016 to clarify certain terms of, and provide feedback on, their interim mark-ups, consistent with the guidance provided by the Strategic Review Committee.

On July 7, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of its advisors participating, to discuss the status of the sale process and the discussions with each of the five remaining bidders and to receive an update from Cravath on the most significant issues raised by the interim mark-ups of the transaction agreements received so far. At the meeting, the Strategic Review Committee discussed Sponsor Fs request to have discussions with David Filo, a director and co-founder of Yahoo, its Chief Yahoo, and its largest individual stockholder, regarding the possibility of Mr. Filo providing equity financing in a bid by Sponsor F. Following discussion, in order to enable Sponsor F to present the best possible bid, the Strategic Review Committee decided that it would permit the bidder to have discussions with Mr. Filo regarding his potential participation in a bid by Sponsor F, so long as Mr. Filo was willing to enter into such discussion and, if so, that he recuse himself from all further Board discussions regarding the sale process and not receive any further information about the bidding process for as long as Mr. Filo contemplated such participation. On behalf of the Strategic Review Committee, a representative of Wilson Sonsini discussed with Mr. Filo whether he would be willing to have discussions with Sponsor F on these terms. Mr. Filo indicated that he would be willing to discuss a potential equity participation in a bid by Sponsor F or, if requested, by another financial sponsor bidder if it would help to facilitate maximizing stockholder value in the strategic alternatives process. The Strategic Review Committee also determined that if any other bidders requested to have discussions with Mr. Filo going forward, the Strategic Review Committee would evaluate those requests on a case-by-case basis. Throughout the week of July 11, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee had numerous discussions with representatives of Cravath, Wilson Sonsini, and the Financial Advisors regarding Mr. Filos potential equity participation in a bid by Sponsor F. Mr. Filo agreed to the restrictions on his access to discussions and information proposed by the Strategic Review Committee.

On July 10, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee had a conference call with representatives of the Financial Advisors, Cravath, and Skadden to review issues raised by the interim mark-ups of the transaction agreements submitted by the bidders. At the meeting, the Strategic Review Committee provided Skadden and Cravath with guidance with respect to the feedback they would deliver to the bidders in accordance with the process outlined in the process letter.

On July 11, 2016, Sponsor B submitted its interim mark-ups of the transaction agreements, which did not contain significant improvements compared to Sponsor Bs prior mark-ups. The next day, principals of Sponsor B met with Mr. Webb to discuss its interest in pursuing a potential acquisition of Yahoos operating business.

On July 14, 2016, representatives of Skadden and Cravath held a conference call with representatives of Sponsor B to provide them with feedback on their interim mark-ups of the transaction agreements.

Also on July 14, 2016, Verizon, Strategic Party B, Sponsor A, and Sponsor F submitted revised, final mark-ups of the transaction agreements.

On July 18 and 19, 2016, all five bidders submitted to the Strategic Review Committee their final acquisition proposals, and Sponsor B also provided revised mark-ups of the transaction agreements and executed

equity and debt financing commitment letters. Sponsor A and Sponsor F did not submit executed financing commitments. The final proposals included the following terms, among others:

On July 18 and July 19, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee had multiple conference calls with its advisors to discuss the final proposals. The Strategic Review Committee considered that (i) Verizons bid offered the highest base purchase price, (ii) Verizon had submitted the transaction agreement mark-ups that were most responsive to the Strategic Review Committees concerns regarding value, certainty of closing, and leaving the

post-closing entity with limited liabilities unrelated to the assets retained by Yahoo, (iii) Verizon had sufficient funds to finance the transaction, whereas the financing of the financial sponsor bidders was less certain, and (iv) Verizon had substantially completed its due diligence review, whereas the financial sponsors needed additional time to complete their due diligence review. In light of these and other factors, the Strategic Review Committee recommended that Yahoo should proceed to negotiate definitive transaction agreements with Verizon on an expedited basis. The Strategic Review Committee also determined, after reviewing proposals received to date for the Excalibur IP Assets, to recommend to the Board that Yahoo should retain the Excalibur IP Assets at that time.

Also on July 18 and July 19, 2016, the Financial Advisors contacted each of the other four bidders to obtain additional information with respect to their proposals, and to discuss whether they could enhance their prices for Yahoos operating business.

Later in the evening on July 19, 2016, the Board, with members of management, representatives of the Strategic Review Committees advisors, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini present, convened to discuss the final proposals received by the Strategic Review Committee. As previously arranged, Mr. Filo did not participate in this Board meeting or any other subsequent Board meetings relating to the proposed transaction and was not given access to materials for the meeting, including the final proposals. At the meeting, representatives of the Financial Advisors reviewed with the Board each of the final proposals. Representatives of Skadden and Cravath then reviewed with the Board the key issues raised by the final mark-ups of the transaction agreements submitted by the bidders. After discussion, considering the factors differentiating Verizons bid described above, the Board determined that Yahoo should proceed to negotiate definitive transaction agreements with Verizon on an expedited basis.

Skadden distributed revised versions of the transaction agreements to Verizon and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (Wachtell), Verizons legal counsel, early on the morning of July 20, 2016. Yahoo Holdings was also formed on July 20, 2016. Beginning later on July 20, 2016, and through the evening of July 22, 2016, Skadden and Wachtell exchanged revised drafts of the transaction agreements, and representatives of Skadden, in consultation with representatives of Cravath, and representatives of Wachtell negotiated the terms of the transaction agreements. Also during this time, the parties negotiated the terms of the Excalibur License Agreement.

In the evening of July 20, 2016, members of the Board, with members of management and representatives of the Strategic Review Committees advisors, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini present, received a telephonic update on the status of the negotiations with Verizon and its advisors.

Also on July 21, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of the Strategic Review Committees advisors participating, to discuss the status of discussions with Verizon. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee the material open items in the transaction agreements and the Strategic Review Committee provided feedback on certain of those matters.

In the afternoon on July 22, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee, together with representatives of its advisors, held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee its fiduciary duties and other relevant legal considerations in connection with recommending a potential transaction to the Board. The representatives of Cravath also reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee the terms of the proposed transaction agreements to be entered into with Verizon and provided the Strategic Review Committee with an update on the status of negotiations. Representatives of the Financial Advisors then each reviewed with the Strategic Review Committee their financial analyses of Yahoo and its operating business. The Strategic Review Committee also discussed with its advisors a communication received by Mr. Webb from the principal of Sponsor B reiterating Sponsor Bs interest in an acquisition.

After the Strategic Review Committees meeting, on July 22, 2016, members of the Strategic Review Committee had a call with a principal of Sponsor B, during which the principal indicated that the Strategic

Review Committee should expect to receive the revised proposal within the next few hours, but did not disclose any specific monetary terms of the revised proposal. Later that evening, just prior to the scheduled start of a Board meeting, the Strategic Review Committee received from Sponsor B a revised proposal to acquire Yahoos operating business for an enterprise value of $4.8 billion contingent on, among other things, Yahoo retaining the cost of its equity awards and Yahoo and Sponsor B agreeing on a key employee reduction plan to be executed prior to closing, on the allocation between Yahoo and Sponsor B of the severance costs related to the reduction plan, as well as several other contract concessions.

In the evening of July 22, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management and representatives of the Strategic Review Committees advisors, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini participating. All of the members of the Board were in attendance, except for Mr. Filo. A representative of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties, as well as the scope of the authority delegated by the Board to the Strategic Review Committee. A representative of Skadden then reviewed with the Board the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction with Verizon contained in the purchase agreement and related transaction agreements. Representatives of Skadden and Cravath also updated the Board on the status of the negotiations. The Board then discussed with the Strategic Review Committees advisors, Skadden, and Wilson Sonsini Sponsor Bs revised proposal. The Board considered, among other things, that the price offered in Sponsor Bs revised proposal was lower than the price offered by Verizon and that Sponsor Bs proposal did not assume the Yahoo RSU awards, the certainty of the Verizon bid, the risk of losing the Verizon bid if Yahoo were to delay signing and pursue further discussions with Sponsor B, and the fact that Sponsor Bs offer was subject to confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation of definitive transaction agreements. The Board concluded that the risks of delaying signing a transaction with Verizon for an inferior offer from Sponsor B outweighed any potential benefit of pursuing further negotiations and noted that, in the proposed transaction with Verizon, the Board retained a customary fiduciary out to pursue an unsolicited potentially superior proposal that emerged after signing the transaction agreements. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs then described certain hedge and warrant transactions relating to the Convertible Notes, with respect to which J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are counterparties to the Company, noting that these interests had been disclosed to, discussed with, and considered by the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in connection with their respective engagements as financial advisors to the Strategic Review Committee. They also discussed with the Board the potential impact of the proposed Sale Transaction on the hedge and warrant transactions, including the value that Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan could potentially receive under various assumptions as a result of their interest in the hedge and warrant transactions, based on theoretical models. Representatives of the Financial Advisors then jointly reviewed with the Board their joint financial analysis of the purchase price to be paid by Verizon to Yahoo in connection with the Sale Transaction (the Original Cash Consideration), which is $4,825,800,000 in cash, subject to adjustments as provided for in the purchase agreement, together with the general substitution of cash-settled Verizon RSU awards for unvested Yahoo RSU awards held by employees of Yahoo Holdings immediately prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction (the RSU Substitution). At this meeting, each of the Financial Advisors then rendered its oral opinion to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board, each of which were subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such Financial Advisors written opinion, the Original Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the purchase agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo.

The Board meeting was then recessed and the Strategic Review Committee held an executive session, during which the Strategic Review Committee unanimously recommended to the Board that the Board approve the purchase agreement and the reorganization agreement negotiated with Verizon and the transactions contemplated by those agreements. The Board meeting was reconvened immediately thereafter and, after receiving the recommendation of the Strategic Review Committee, the Board, by unanimous vote of all directors present at the meeting (which excluded Mr. Filo), (i) determined that the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction are expedient and for the best interests of Yahoo and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction, (iii) recommended, subject to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, that the Yahoo stockholders adopt a resolution authorizing the Sale Transaction, and (iv) directed that the Sale Transaction be submitted for consideration by the stockholders at the special meeting.

Following the meeting, until early morning on July 23, 2016, representatives of Skadden, in consultation with Cravath, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (which acted as intellectual property counsel to Yahoo), and Wachtell finalized the terms of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, and on the morning of July 23, 2016, Yahoo and Verizon executed the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings executed the Original Reorganization Agreement, and Yahoo and Excalibur executed the Excalibur License Agreement.

On July 25, 2016, Yahoo and Verizon issued a joint press release announcing the transaction and the execution of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo publicly disclosed that a copy of certain user account information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoos network in late 2014 (the 2014 Security Incident), and that it believed the user account information was stolen by a state-sponsored actor. Yahoo disclosed that the account information included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. Yahoos forensic investigation indicated that the stolen information did not include unprotected passwords, payment card data, or bank account information. In a statement issued on the same day, Verizon stated that it had limited information and understanding of the impact of the 2014 Security Incident and would evaluate it as the investigation continued through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities.

The Board formed an independent committee (the Independent Committee) to investigate the 2014 Security Incident and related matters, including the scope of knowledge within the Company in 2014 of access to Yahoos network by the state-sponsored actor responsible for the theft and related incidents, and Yahoos internal and external reporting processes and remediation efforts related to the 2014 Security Incident and related incidents.

On October 5, 2016, the Board met at Yahoos Sunnyvale headquarters, with members of management and representatives of Skadden and Wilson Sonsini present, to discuss, among other things, the 2014 Security Incident and related matters. A representative of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. The Board also reviewed with Skadden the implications of the 2014 Security Incident under the Original Sale Transaction Agreements. Also at the October 5 Board meeting, the Board increased the size of the Strategic Review Committee to five directors and appointed Mr. Braham and Ms. Friedman as additional members of the committee.

Throughout October and November 2016, each of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board met periodically to discuss the pending sale of the Business to Verizon in light of the 2014 Security Incident and related matters, and the Independent Committee, with the assistance of independent legal counsel and a forensic expert, continued to investigate the 2014 Security Incident and related matters.

On October 24, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management and representatives of Cravath, Skadden and Wilson Sonsini participating for relevant portions of the meeting, to discuss potential implications of the 2014 Security Incident for the pending sale of the Business to Verizon and potential claims Verizon could assert in connection with the 2014 Security Incident, including under the Original Sale Transaction Agreements. The Board also discussed potential legal risks and claims and related costs that might result from the 2014 Security Incident, including, among other things, the possibility of user class-action lawsuits and regulatory actions. In response to the risks to the pending Sale Transaction posed by the 2014 Security Incident, the Board authorized the Strategic Review Committee to engage in discussions with Verizon regarding a possible agreement under which Yahoo would retain liability for a portion of certain costs and expenses arising from the 2014 Security Incident.

On November 1, 2016, Messrs. McInerney and Smith, accompanied by a representative of Cravath, met with Mr. McAdam, Marni Walden, Verizons Executive Vice President and President of Product Innovation and New Businesses, and Craig Silliman, Verizons General Counsel and Executive Vice President  Public Policy, to discuss potential resolutions of possible claims including under the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, in connection with the 2014 Security Incident and related matters.

On November 3, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting at which, among other things, the directors discussed the 2014 Security Incident. Messrs. McInerney and Smith briefed the Board on their meeting with representatives of Verizon and possible next steps were discussed.

On November 5, 2016, Mr. McInerney had a further conversation with Mr. McAdam and later that day briefed the Strategic Review Committee on his discussion with Mr. McAdam. On November 7, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting and received a briefing on communications with representatives of Verizon.

On November 8, 2016, Mr. McInerney and Mr. McAdam spoke by telephone regarding possible modifications to the Sale Transaction and reached a preliminary understanding, subject to negotiation of mutually acceptable documentation and approval by the Board and Verizons board of directors, on the key elements of a potential resolution of issues relating to the 2014 Security Incident. Under the terms discussed, Yahoo and Verizon would split evenly certain liabilities arising out of the 2014 Security Incident and potentially other data breaches in consideration for Verizons waiver and release of certain possible claims, including, among other things, rights to refuse to close the Sale Transaction or to terminate the Original Stock Purchase Agreement as a result of the 2014 Security Incident and related matters.

On November 9, 2016, Yahoo disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that its outside forensic experts were investigating the creation of forged cookies that could allow an intruder to access users accounts without a password (the Cookie Forging Activity). Yahoo also disclosed in such Quarterly Report that it was investigating with the assistance of outside forensic experts certain data files provided to Yahoo by law enforcement which a third party claimed contained Yahoo user account data.

Between November 9 and November 13, 2016, representatives of Cravath had multiple conversations with representatives of Verizon and Wachtell regarding the terms of potential amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and a settlement of potential claims.

On November 14, 2016, representatives of Wachtell sent to representatives of Cravath drafts of amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements. On November 18, 2016, representatives of Cravath sent comments on the documents provided by Wachtell, as well as a draft settlement and release agreement to be entered into between Yahoo and Verizon. Between November 14 and December 2, 2016, representatives of the Strategic Review Committee, Yahoo management, Verizon, Cravath and Wachtell had multiple conference calls regarding, and exchanged multiple revised drafts of, these documents. Also during this period, the Board met periodically and received updates from the Strategic Review Committee regarding the status of ongoing negotiations with Verizon regarding the draft amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and settlement and release agreement.

On December 2, 2016, representatives of Yahoo updated representatives of Verizon on Yahoos investigation of the data files provided by law enforcement. Shortly thereafter, the representatives of Verizon advised the representatives of Yahoo that Verizon would defer reaching any conclusions regarding a potential settlement with Yahoo until Yahoo had made further progress in the investigation and had completed any necessary user notification requirements.

On December 6 and 7, 2016, the Board met at Yahoos Sunnyvale headquarters, with representatives of management, Cravath, Skadden and Wilson Sonsini present for relevant portions of the meeting. At the meeting, among other things, the Board received an update on the status of the Independent Committees investigation and discussed Verizons decision to defer reaching any conclusions regarding a potential settlement with Yahoo.

On December 14, 2016, Yahoo publicly disclosed that, based on its outside forensic experts analysis of data files provided to it in November 2016 by law enforcement, Yahoo believed an unauthorized third party had stolen data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August 2013 (the 2013 Security Incident and, collectively with the 2014 Security Incident and the Cookie Forging Activity, the Security Incidents). Yahoo disclosed that it had not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft, and that Yahoo believed this incident was likely distinct from the 2014 Security Incident. Yahoo also disclosed that the stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. In a public statement made on the same day, Verizon stated that it would evaluate the situation as Yahoo continued its investigation and would review the impact of the new development before reaching any final conclusions.

Throughout the months of December 2016 and January 2017, the Independent Committee, with the assistance of independent counsel and a forensic expert, continued its investigation. In addition, the Strategic Review Committee continued to meet periodically to, among other things, receive updates from Yahoos management regarding the impact of the Security Incidents and related matters. The Board also continued to meet periodically to discuss, among other things, the status of communications with Verizon, the Security Incidents and the findings of the Independent Committees investigation.

Also during this period, Yahoos management analyzed the impact of the Security Incidents and related matters on the Business and provided the Board and the Strategic Review Committee with periodic updates with respect to the results thereof. Verizon was provided with periodic updates with respect to these matters in January and February 2017.

On January 9, 2017, Yahoo announced that immediately following the closing, the size of the Board will be reduced to five directors, that Mr. Braham, Mr. Brandt, Ms. Friedman, Mr. McInerney and Mr. Smith will continue to serve as directors of the Fund following the Closing, with Mr. Brandt serving as Chairman of the Board, and that each of Mr. Filo, Mr. Hartenstein, Mr. Hill, Ms. Mayer, Jane E. Shaw and Mr. Webb had indicated that he or she intends to resign from the Board effective upon the closing of the Sale Transaction. (Mr. Smith subsequently also indicated that he intends to resign from the Board effective upon the closing of the Sale Transaction.) Also on that date, to facilitate the transition of Yahoo to an investment company following the closing of the Sale Transaction, Mr. Brandt became Chairman of the Board and Mr. Webb became Chairman Emeritus of the Board.

On February 1, 2017, Mr. McInerney and a representative of Cravath participated in a conference call with Mr. McAdam and other representatives of Verizon to discuss the status of Verizons evaluation of the impact of the Security Incidents on the Business. During the call, the representatives of Verizon indicated that Verizon needed to review additional information in order to complete its assessment and that it could take several months for Verizon to finalize such review. Mr. McAdam proposed that the parties could proceed in one of three ways: Verizon could complete its evaluation of the impact of the Security Incidents on the Business over the next several months, after which Verizon would decide how to proceed and whether to assert any legal rights against Yahoo; Yahoo could agree to, among other things, a purchase price reduction in return for Verizons release of potential rights and claims in respect of the data security incidents; or the parties could mutually agree to terminate the Sale Transaction. Mr. McInerney asked Mr. McAdam the magnitude of the purchase price reduction being requested and Mr. McAdam noted that Verizon was still formulating a view but that a purchase price reduction as high as $925 million could be appropriate.

Later in the day on February 1, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of Cravath participating, to discuss Verizons proposal. The Board held a telephonic meeting on February 2, 2017, with members of management and representatives of Cravath, Skadden and Wilson Sonsini present, at which Mr. McInerney reviewed with the Board the alternatives proposed by Verizon.

The Strategic Review Committee met again telephonically on February 3, 2017, with representatives of Cravath and the Financial Advisors participating. The Strategic Review Committee discussed, among other things: the alternatives raised by Verizon, including the proposed reduction in the purchase price; the parties

rights and obligations under the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and potential legal bases on which Verizon could seek to refuse to close the Sale Transaction and the merits of such potential claims; the expected timeline of potential litigation in the event Verizon refused to close the Sale Transaction and the costs, risks and uncertainties associated with such litigation; and Yahoos potential alternatives to the Sale Transaction if the Original Sale Transaction Agreements were to be terminated, including, among other things, a spin-off of the Business. The Strategic Review Committee also discussed, with input from the Financial Advisors, the prospect that proposals received in the original sale process would continue to be available in the event the Sale Transaction were to be terminated.

On February 6, 2017, the Board held a meeting at Wilson Sonsinis Palo Alto offices, with the Financial Advisors, Cravath, Skadden, Wilson Sonsini and the Independent Committees independent legal counsel participating in person or telephonically in the relevant portions of the meeting, to discuss, among other things, the Security Incidents, potential claims that could be raised by Verizon and the merits of such potential claims, the timing, costs and risks associated with any litigation with Verizon regarding such potential claims, the status of the negotiations with Verizon, including the purchase price reduction proposed by Verizon, and potential options available to Yahoo and the risks and uncertainties inherent in each. The representatives of the Financial Advisors presented certain preliminary financial analyses, and the Board discussed, among other things, with input from the Financial Advisors and legal counsel, whether it was feasible for Yahoo to pursue alternative transactions, including a reverse spin-off of the Business, in the event that the Original Sale Transaction Agreements were to be terminated. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Strategic Review Committee to continue discussions with Verizon regarding a potential resolution relating to the Security Incidents and related matters and to seek to negotiate more favorable terms.

On February 9, 2017, Mr. McInerney and Mr. McAdam met at Verizons offices in New York City. At such meeting, Mr. McInerney informed Mr. McAdam that the Board was unwilling to agree to a purchase price reduction at the high end of the range previously discussed. After further discussion, Mr. McAdam and Mr. McInerney each agreed to review with their respective boards of directors a proposal that included a purchase price reduction in the amount of $350 million.

Later in the afternoon on February 9, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting at which Mr. McInerney briefed the other members of the Strategic Review Committee on his conversation with Mr. McAdam. In the evening of February 9, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of Cravath, Skadden and Wilson Sonsini participating, to, among other things, receive an update from Mr. McInerney regarding his discussions with Verizon. Following discussion of, among other things, the Security Incidents, alternatives proposed by Verizon, including the proposed purchase price reduction, and potential options available to Yahoo and the risks and uncertainties inherent in each, including the risk of an adverse outcome and the potential delay associated with a litigation process, the Board determined that Yahoo should seek to finalize a potential resolution with Verizon on the basis of Verizons revised proposal.

Also in the evening of February 9, 2017, following the Board meeting, representatives of Yahoo indicated to representatives of Verizon that Yahoo was prepared to proceed on the basis of the proposal discussed by Mr. McInerney and Mr. McAdam. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell sent representatives of Cravath revised drafts of the proposed amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and the settlement and release agreement, reflecting, among other things, a reduction in the cash consideration to be paid by Verizon in connection with the Sale Transaction to $4,475,800,000, subject to adjustment as provided in the Original Stock Purchase Agreement (the Cash Consideration). Between February 9, 2017 and the execution of the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments on February 20, 2017, representatives of Yahoo, Verizon, Cravath and Wachtell had multiple telephone conferences to negotiate the terms, and exchanged additional revised drafts, of the amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and the settlement and release agreement.

On February 13, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of management, Cravath, Skadden and Wilson Sonsini participating. At the meeting, the Board, among other things, reviewed updated forecasted financial information for the years 2017 and 2018 and forecasted financial information for the year

2019, in each case prepared by Yahoos management for purposes of the Financial Advisors financial analyses and fairness opinions. The Board approved the forecasted financial information for use by the Financial Advisors in performing their financial analyses in connection with their rendering of fairness opinions with respect to the Sale Transaction.

The Strategic Review Committee met telephonically, with representatives of Cravath participating, on February 14, 2017, to discuss the status of the negotiations with Verizon, including the open issues in the amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and the settlement and release agreement, and related matters. On February 15, 2017, Mr. McInerney and Mr. Silliman further discussed the terms of the draft documents.

On February 19, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management and representatives of Cravath, Skadden, Wilson Sonsini and the Financial Advisors participating in the relevant portions of the meeting. At the meeting, among other things, a representative of Cravath reviewed with the Board the terms and conditions of the proposed amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and the settlement and release agreement and updated the Board on the status of the negotiations. Representatives of the Financial Advisors reviewed with the Board their financial analyses of the revised consideration proposed to be paid by Verizon to Yahoo. The Board deferred taking any action with respect to the amendments and agreement pending resolution of all remaining open issues.

In the morning of February 20, 2017, Mr. McInerney and Mr. Silliman discussed the remaining open issues in the drafts of the amendments to the Original Sale Transaction Agreements and the settlement and release agreement and, over the course of the day, representatives of the Strategic Review Committee, Verizon, Cravath and Wachtell finalized the terms of the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments and the Settlement and Release Agreement.

Later on February 20, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management and representatives of Cravath, Skadden, Wilson Sonsini and the Financial Advisors participating in the relevant portions of the meeting. A representative of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. Each of the Financial Advisors then rendered its oral opinion to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board, each of which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such Financial Advisors written opinion, the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo. The Strategic Review Committee then recommended to the Board that the Board approve the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments and the Settlement and Release Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. After receiving the recommendation of the Strategic Review Committee, the Board, by unanimous vote of all directors voting (with Mr. Filo abstaining), (i) determined that the Sale Transaction Agreements, as amended by the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments, and the Sale Transaction are expedient and for the best interests of Yahoo and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments, the Settlement and Release Agreement, and the Sale Transaction, (iii) recommended, subject to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended by the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments, that the Yahoo stockholders adopt a resolution authorizing the Sale Transaction, and (iv) directed that the Sale Transaction be submitted for consideration by the stockholders.

Following the meeting, Yahoo and Verizon executed the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments. On February 21, 2017, Yahoo and Verizon issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments and the Settlement and Release Agreement.

The Strategic Review Committee recommended to the Board that the Board approve the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction. In arriving at its recommendation, the Strategic Review Committee

consulted with its outside legal and financial advisors and the Companys senior management team, reviewed a significant amount of information, and considered a number of factors.

After careful consideration, the Board, based upon, among other considerations, the recommendation of the Strategic Review Committee, (i) determined that the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction are expedient and for the best interests of Yahoo and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Sale Transaction, (iii) recommended, subject to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, that the stockholders of Yahoo approve the Sale Transaction, and (iv) directed that the Sale Transaction be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Yahoo at the special meeting. In arriving at its determination, the Board consulted with the Companys senior management team, as well as with outside legal and financial advisors to the Board, the Strategic Review Committee, and the Company, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, the following factors which each of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board viewed as supporting its respective determination:

The Strategic Review Committee and the Board also considered potential uncertainties, drawbacks, and risks relating to the Sale Transaction, including the following potential risks and potentially negative factors, but determined that these potential risks and potentially negative factors were outweighed by the expected benefits of the Sale Transaction:

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Strategic Review Committee and the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes material factors considered by the Strategic Review Committee and the Board. The Strategic Review Committee also considered other factors in deciding to recommend the Sale Transaction for approval to the Board, and the Board also considered other factors in deciding to approve and recommend that Yahoo stockholders authorize the Sale Transaction. In reaching its decision and recommendation to the Board the Strategic Review Committee did not, and in reaching its decision and recommendation to Yahoo stockholders the Board did not, quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.

This explanation of the Strategic Review Committees and the Boards reasons for the Sale Transaction and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the section of this proxy statement entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.

The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the Sale Proposal.

This proxy statement highlights selected information related to the Sale Transaction. This proxy statement therefore may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the Sale Transaction more fully and for a complete description of the legal terms of the Sale Transaction, you should read this entire proxy statement, the annexes and exhibits to this proxy statement, and the documents we incorporate by reference into this proxy statement carefully before voting. You may obtain the documents and information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the section of this proxy statement entitled Where You Can Find Additional Information.

Yahoo and Verizon have entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo has agreed to sell, and Verizon has agreed to purchase, all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings and pursuant to which Yahoo and Verizon will effect the Foreign Sale Transaction. Immediately prior to the completion of the Sale Transaction, Yahoo Holdings will own the Business, other than specified excluded assets and retained liabilities as described more fully in the following paragraph. The purchase price that Verizon will pay or cause to be paid in connection with the Sale Transaction is $4,475,800,000 in cash, subject to adjustments as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

In connection with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings have entered into the Reorganization Agreement pursuant to which Yahoo will transfer to Yahoo Holdings prior to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement all of the assets and liabilities of the Business, other than specified excluded assets, which include its cash and marketable debt securities as of the closing, its shares in Alibaba (held directly and indirectly), its shares in Yahoo Japan, certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity of Excalibur (which owns the Excalibur IP Assets), and specified retained liabilities, which include the Convertible Notes, securityholder litigation, 50 percent of certain cash liabilities related to the Data Breaches, and certain director and officer indemnification obligations.

As used in this proxy statement, Data Breaches means (a) the Security Incidents and certain other matters related to Yahoos data security disclosed by Yahoo to Verizon prior to February 20, 2017, in each case including any related matters that may arise from Yahoos ongoing investigations thereof and any use or transfer of data obtained as a result of any of the foregoing matters (the matters described in this clause (a), the User Security Matters) and (b) any other security breaches sustained by or perpetrated against Yahoo (whether known or unknown) through February 20, 2017 that, in the case of this clause (b), involve any actor that sponsored or perpetrated any User Security Matter.

On February 20, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment and the Reorganization Agreement Amendment, Yahoo, Yahoo Holdings and Verizon entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the Settlement and Release Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, Verizon released certain claims, subject to certain exceptions, it (and its affiliates and representatives) may have against Yahoo (or its affiliates and representatives) related to the Data Breaches.

Upon completion of the Sale Transaction, Verizon will also receive, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement between Yahoo and Excalibur, which will be assigned by Yahoo to Yahoo Holdings in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement (the Excalibur License Agreement), dated the date of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, for its benefit and that of its current and certain of its future affiliates, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to the Excalibur IP Assets, which are not being transferred to Yahoo Holdings with the Business.

The Company After the Completion of the Sale Transaction

Upon the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Companys remaining assets will consist solely of the assets excluded from the Sale Transaction, which include, among others, its cash and marketable debt securities

as of the closing, its shares in Alibaba (held directly and indirectly), its shares in Yahoo Japan, certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity in Excalibur (which owns the Excalibur IP Assets), and the Companys remaining liabilities will consist solely of the liabilities retained in the Sale Transaction, which include, among others, the Convertible Notes, securityholder litigation, 50 percent of certain cash liabilities related to the Data Breaches, and certain director and officer indemnification obligations. Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Business will be owned and operated by Verizon, and the Company will have no interest in, and receive no income from, the Business.

Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Company will continue to be a Delaware corporation publicly traded on Nasdaq but will be renamed Altaba Inc. and trade under the ticker symbol AABA. Because the Companys assets will then consist primarily of its equity investments, short-term debt investments, and cash, the Company will be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act.

Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, in order to comply with the 1940 Act, the Company will amend the Existing Charter to provide that the exculpation and indemnification provisions of Articles XI and XII of the Existing Charter are subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act with respect to actions taken while the Company is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsAmendment to Yahoos Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation for additional information.

The completion of the Sale Transaction will not affect your shares of Yahoo common stock, which will continue to represent shares of common stock of the Fund after it has registered as an investment company. Yahoo stockholders will not receive any shares of Verizon common stock and will not retain any continuing interest in the Business following completion of the Sale Transaction, other than in connection with the RSU Substitution. See the section of this proxy statement entitled The Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Stock Purchase AgreementTreatment of Certain Yahoo Equity.

Although Yahoo has no current intention of selling, prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction, any of the assets that are not included in the Sale Transaction, Yahoo reserves the right to sell any such assets prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction. There is no assurance that the Funds Initial Assets will consist of all of the assets described above. There is also no assurance as to the value of the consideration Yahoo might receive in the event of any such disposition. Additionally, Yahoo and the Board reserve the right to distribute any of its cash to investors prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction through repurchases of its common stock or outstanding debt securities or distributions.

The Fund currently intends to return substantially all of its cash to stockholders over time through stock repurchases and distributions, although the Fund will retain sufficient cash to satisfy its obligations to creditors and for working capital. The timing and method of any return of capital will be determined by the Board. Stock repurchases may take place in the open market, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans or in a tender offer, or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured and derivative transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions. The Fund currently anticipates that the amount of cash to be retained by the Fund will be at least $1.4 billion, which is the minimum amount necessary to satisfy the Funds obligations under the Convertible Notes. However, the Funds obligations to creditors and working capital requirements may vary over time and may be materially greater than such amount, depending upon, among other factors, the cost of cash-settling any conversion obligations under the Convertible Notes, the Funds potential obligations with respect to other Retained Liabilities (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled The Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Reorganization AgreementRetained Liabilities), and whether the income from the Funds investments is sufficient to cover its expenses.

We have included disclosures relating to the Fund in Annex 1 to this proxy statement, entitled Description of the Fund Following the Sale Transaction. Annex 1 includes a description of the Fund, including its manner of operation and anticipated operating expenses, regulation, risks, pro forma financials, and other relevant information. You should read Annex 1 carefully as it contains important information about your interest in the Fund following the completion of the Sale Transaction.

The structure of the Company currently and immediately after the Sale Transaction is illustrated below:

The Stock Purchase Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement are attached as exhibits to this proxy statement to provide stockholders with information regarding their terms. The Sale Transaction Agreements

contain representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Sale Transaction Agreements. These representations and warranties (i) are not intended to be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate, (ii) may have been qualified in the Sale Transaction Agreements by confidential disclosure schedules that were delivered to the other party thereto in connection with the signing of the Sale Transaction Agreements, such disclosure schedules containing information that modifies, qualifies, and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties, and covenants set forth in the Sale Transaction Agreements, (iii) may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, and (iv) were made only as of the date of the applicable Original Sale Transaction Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in such Sale Transaction Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties, and covenants may change after the date of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, and may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by Yahoo or Verizon. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Yahoo or Verizon.

The summaries of the Sale Transaction Agreements and the Settlement and Release Agreement contained in this proxy statement do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the full text of the Sale Transaction Agreements. Copies of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment are attached as Exhibits A-1 and A-2, respectively, to this proxy statement. Copies of the Original Reorganization Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement Amendment are attached as Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively, to this proxy statement. A copy of the Settlement and Release Agreement is attached as Exhibit C to this proxy statement.

This section is not intended to provide you with any other factual information about Yahoo. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings Yahoo makes with the SEC, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled Where You Can Find Additional Information.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Verizon will pay or cause to be paid to Yahoo, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings and the shares of Foreign SaleCo transferred in the Foreign Sale Transaction, an aggregate cash purchase price equal to $4,475,800,000, less any applicable withholding taxes and subject to the following adjustments:

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement (see the section of this proxy statement entitled Conditions to Completion of the Sale Transaction), the closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement (other than conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). We currently expect the closing to occur in the second quarter of 2017.

Conditions to Completion of the Sale Transaction

Yahoos and Verizons obligations to complete the Sale Transaction are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

Yahoos obligations to complete the Sale Transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

Verizons obligations to complete the Sale Transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

For purposes of the Stock Purchase Agreement and as used in this proxy statement, Business Material Adverse Effect means any circumstance, event, development, effect, change, or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate:

Pursuant to the RSU Substitution, each Yahoo RSU award that is held as of immediately prior to the closing by an employee of Yahoo Holdings (or a subsidiary thereof), who will automatically become an employee of Verizon (or a subsidiary thereof) immediately following the closing, and that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the closing, will be replaced with a cash-settled Verizon RSU award, with the number of shares of Verizon common stock subject to the Verizon RSU award equal to the number of shares of Yahoo common stock subject to the corresponding Yahoo RSU award immediately prior to the closing multiplied by the ratio of the average trading price of Yahoo common stock during the three-day period preceding the day before the closing date over the average trading price of Verizon common stock during the three-day period immediately following the closing date; however, Verizon may determine to settle Verizon RSU awards held by non-U.S. employees in shares of Verizon common stock in limited circumstances. Yahoo RSU awards subject to performance-based vesting will similarly be replaced with performance-based cash-settled Verizon RSU awards, with both the annual target number of shares and the annual maximum number of shares adjusted according to the above ratio; however, shares allocated to the performance year in which the closing occurs will be replaced based on target performance only (and the replacement Verizon RSU awards for that year will not be performance-based) and shares allocated to future performance years will be subject to such performance-based vesting criteria as may be established by Verizon. The Verizon RSU awards will otherwise be subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding Yahoo RSU Awards.

Yahoo RSU awards held by Yahoo non-employee directors and individuals who are employees of the Fund as of immediately following the closing will not be replaced with Verizon RSU awards and will instead vest in full in accordance with the terms of the applicable Yahoo equity plan governing such awards. The Fund will retain all liabilities and obligations with respect to Yahoo RSU awards held by non-employee directors and individuals who are employees of the Fund immediately following the closing.

Each Yahoo stock option outstanding immediately prior to the closing will, if not already vested, become fully vested and exercisable, effective as of the closing, and all Yahoo stock options will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. The Fund will retain all liabilities and obligations with respect to all Yahoo stock options.

Following the closing, Yahoo will remain responsible for delivering Yahoo common stock to settle holdback arrangements in connection with certain historic acquisitions by Yahoo (such shares of Yahoo, the Acquisition Holdback Stock).

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo has agreed that, from the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo will (and will cause its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, and

employees to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other representatives to), except as otherwise permitted by the Stock Purchase Agreement:

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo has agreed that, from the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement until the earlier of the closing or the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo will not (and will cause its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, and employees not to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other representatives not to), directly or indirectly, except as otherwise permitted by the Stock Purchase Agreement:

In the event that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law, Yahoo is permitted to grant a waiver of or terminate any stand-still obligation of a third party to allow such third party to submit a Competing Proposal (and must also waive or terminate any standstill obligation applicable to Verizon and its affiliates pursuant to its confidentiality agreement with Yahoo).

For purposes of the Stock Purchase Agreement and as used in this proxy statement, a Competing Proposal means any bona fide proposal or offer made by any third party to purchase, directly or indirectly, (i) beneficial ownership of more than 25 percent of any class of equity of Yahoo (other than a Permitted Whole-Co Transaction) or (ii) assets or businesses of Yahoo and the Business Subsidiaries constituting more than 25 percent of the consolidated assets of Yahoo (excluding in both the numerator and denominator for purposes of calculating such percentage of consolidated assets any Excluded Assets). Any proposal solely with respect to Excluded Assets will not constitute a Competing Proposal so long as such proposal does not, and would not reasonably be expected to, conflict with, impede, delay, or prohibit the completion of the Sale Transaction.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo has agreed that, from the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement and prior to the date the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if Yahoo receives a written Competing Proposal that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement, (i) Yahoo may contact such third party to obtain clarification of the terms thereof and (ii) Yahoo and the Board (including any duly authorized committee) and its representatives may engage in negotiations with, or furnish any information or access to, such third party and its representatives, affiliates, and prospective financing sources if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Additionally, unless otherwise provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Board is not permitted to (i) withdraw, modify, or qualify (or propose publicly to withdraw, modify, or qualify), in a manner adverse to Verizon, the Seller Recommendation (as defined below); (ii) endorse, recommend, declare advisable, or approve or propose publicly to endorse, recommend, declare advisable, or approve, any Competing Proposal; (iii) fail to include in this proxy statement the Seller Recommendation; or (iv) fail to recommend against any Competing Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within 10 business days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) above, an Adverse Recommendation Change).

Yahoo is required to notify Verizon within 48 hours of the receipt of any Competing Proposal, and disclose to Verizon the identity of the third party making the Competing Proposal and the material terms thereof (including by providing unredacted copies of any written materials). Yahoo is also required to notify Verizon within 48 hours of any material developments regarding such Competing Proposal (including by providing unredacted copies of any written materials).

Yahoo is required to provide Verizon with four business days notice of its intention to (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Competing Proposal or a material intervening event (other than a Competing Proposal) that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board at the time of the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement (an Intervening Event) or (ii) terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal. During such four business day period (plus two additional business days for each material change to the facts or circumstances relating to the Intervening Event or material modification to a Competing Proposal), Yahoo is required to negotiate with Verizon to revise the terms of the Sale Transaction so that the Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or to remedy the effects of an Intervening Event (Verizons matching right).

Following the conclusion of Verizons matching right, after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and/or the Sale Transaction to which Verizon would agree, the Board may (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Competing Proposal that the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal in circumstances not involving a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement or in response to an Intervening Event or (ii) terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in circumstances not involving a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement, but in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii) only if the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law. Verizon may also terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement in response to an Adverse Recommendation Change. In the event of any such termination, Yahoo must pay the Termination Fee to Verizon.

For purposes of the Stock Purchase Agreement and as used in this proxy statement, a Superior Proposal means a Competing Proposal (with all references to 25 percent in the definition of Competing Proposal being replaced with 65 percent) made by a third party on terms that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Yahoos financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors the Board deems appropriate, are more favorable from a financial point of view to Yahoo and its stockholders than the Sale Transaction (including any revisions to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Sale Transaction committed to by Verizon to Yahoo in writing in response to such Competing Proposal) and that the Board determines is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed.

Yahoo is required to pay Verizon the Termination Fee in the event that:

As discussed more fully in No Solicitation above, subject to certain other restrictions applicable to Yahoo and the Business prior to the closing (including those described under the section of this proxy statement entitled Conduct of Business by Yahoo and the Business Subsidiaries Prior to the Closing), Yahoo is not restricted from soliciting or taking any action or other activity with respect to, and will not be obligated to pay the Termination Fee to Verizon for, any third party proposal (i) to acquire 25 percent or less of Yahoos stock or consolidated assets (excluding in both the numerator and denominator for purposes of calculating such percentage of consolidated assets any Excluded Assets), (ii) that constitutes a Permitted Whole-Co Transaction, or (iii) solely with respect to Excluded Assets if the proposal would not reasonably be expected to conflict with, delay, impede, or prohibit the completion of the Sale Transaction.

If Verizon terminates the Stock Purchase Agreement due to a breach by Yahoo of the Stock Purchase Agreement that would cause a failure of the conditions to the closing to be satisfied (and such breach is not timely cured), Yahoo is required to reimburse Verizons expenses in an amount up to $15,000,000 (which is creditable toward the Termination Fee).

The Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including:

The Stock Purchase Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties made by Yahoo. Such representations and warranties are subject to qualifications and exceptions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement or in the confidential disclosure schedule provided by Yahoo to Verizon pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, and relate to, among other things, the following:

The Stock Purchase Agreement also contains a number of representations and warranties made by Verizon. Such representations and warranties are subject to qualifications and exceptions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement and relate to, among other things, the following:

Conduct of Business by Yahoo and the Business Subsidiaries Prior to the Closing

Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo has agreed that, subject to exceptions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (with notable examples thereof set forth below), between the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement and the closing, Yahoo (to the extent related to the Business, unless the act or omission in question would or would reasonably be expected to be adverse (other than in a de minimis respect) to the Business Subsidiaries, the Business, Verizon or any of Verizons subsidiaries (in a manner relating to the Sale Transaction including from a tax perspective or otherwise), or the Sale Transaction) will, and will cause the Business Subsidiaries to, carry on the Business in all material respects in the ordinary course and use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact the Business organization, goodwill, and material third-party Business relationships. Yahoo also agreed that, subject to exceptions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (with notable examples thereof set forth below), Yahoo will not, and will cause the Business Subsidiaries not to, take the following actions (or announce, authorize, or enter into any commitment to do so):

The general conduct requirements and specific restrictions on the operations set forth above are not applicable to the following:

Verizon and Yahoo have agreed to certain obligations with respect to this proxy statement:

In accordance with Yahoos organizational documents, applicable law, and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, Yahoo has agreed to, as promptly as practicable, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold a special meeting of Yahoo stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval and, if Yahoo deems necessary or advisable, stockholder approval for actions reasonably necessary to comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act following the Funds registration as a registered investment company at or after the closing. Yahoo may postpone or adjourn the special meeting (i) for up to 10 business days to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, if Yahoo determines in good faith that such a postponement or adjournment is necessary or advisable to obtain the Stockholder Approval and (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure necessary under applicable law for review by Yahoo stockholders prior to the special meeting.

Yahoo and Verizon have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to complete the Sale Transaction, cause the conditions to the closing to be satisfied, and obtain or deliver all required or necessary governmental and third party consents, including in connection with obtaining antitrust approvals for the Sale Transaction. Verizon is required to take all necessary actions to avoid or eliminate all impediments under applicable antitrust laws, but is not required (nor is Yahoo permitted without Verizons consent) to make divestitures or take other actions that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Verizon or the Business (in each case measured on a scale relative to the Business) (a Burdensome Condition). These antitrust approvals were obtained in December 2016.

Yahoo is required to file appropriate documentation to change as promptly as practicable after the closing, and in any event (i) within five business days of the closing, the corporate names of Yahoo and the subsidiaries retained by Yahoo and (ii) within 60 days after the closing, any doing business as names, trade names, or other corporate identifiers of Yahoo and the subsidiaries retained by Yahoo, in each case to a name that does not contain any of the Businesss names and marks, including, among others, Yahoo and Yahoo!.

For a 12-month period after the closing, Verizon will provide each employee of the Business that transfers to Verizon at the closing:

In addition, for a 12-month period after the closing, Verizon will provide each employee of the Business who transfers to Verizon at the closing with severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits for which such employee would have been eligible under Yahoos severance plans, policies, and agreements immediately following the closing.

Each employee will receive service credit for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting, and for purposes of vacation accrual and level of severance benefits, for his or her service with Yahoo and its Business Subsidiaries under analogous plans that are maintained by Verizon or its subsidiaries as of the closing and in which such employee is eligible to participate.

Verizon will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, and waiting periods under the benefit plans it maintains to the extent waived or not included under the analogous Yahoo benefit plan and (2) provide credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket expenses that were paid prior to the closing under the analogous Yahoo benefit plan.

On December 20, 2016, Verizon requested, pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, that Yahoo cause the equity interests in certain Business Subsidiaries conducting foreign operations of the Business to be transferred to Foreign SaleCo. Therefore, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, immediately prior to Yahoo transferring all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings to Verizon, Yahoo Holdings will transfer all of the outstanding shares of Foreign SaleCo to a foreign subsidiary of Verizon in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the portion of the base purchase price attributable to such shares and distribute such cash to Yahoo.

The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of any person in the Stock Purchase Agreement (and any certificate delivered pursuant thereto) generally terminate at the closing or upon the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement (except for certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the parties relating to financing cooperation and the Convertible Notes), other than any covenants or agreements of the parties which contemplate performance or survival post-closing or post-termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement and certain obligations of Yahoo with respect to the User Security Matters.

The Stock Purchase Agreement may not be amended unless in writing signed by Yahoo and Verizon. Subject to applicable law, either Yahoo or Verizon may (1) extend the time for the performance of obligations or other acts of the other party, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, and (3) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

Yahoo and Verizon agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms and therefore each party will be entitled to specific performance of the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity.

Yahoo will control the defense of any litigation brought by Yahoo stockholders against Yahoo and/or its directors relating to the Sale Transaction. Yahoo must promptly provide Verizon with copies of related proceedings and correspondence, give Verizon the opportunity to consult with Yahoo regarding the defense or settlement of such litigation, and not compromise or settle such litigation without Verizons prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), unless such settlement would not affect Verizon or the Business in any material respect post-closing, including settlements for solely monetary damages to be paid by Yahoo or entirely from Yahoos insurance.

Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that, except as may be required pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement as described below, the Convertible Notes will not be assumed by Yahoo Holdings or Verizon and will constitute Retained Liabilities (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled The Reorganization AgreementRetained Liabilities). Yahoo may, in its reasonable discretion, conduct a tender offer and/or consent solicitation to amend the indenture (the Indenture), dated as of November 26, 2013, between Yahoo and the Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, so long as Yahoo keeps Verizon reasonably informed regarding such tender offer and/or consent solicitation.

If a court determines in a final non-appealable judgment or a judgment Yahoo determines not to appeal that the Sale Transaction constitutes a sale, conveyance, transfer, or lease of all or substantially all of Yahoos properties and assets to another person, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings will, among other things, enter into a supplemental indenture which satisfies the requirements of the Indenture, including causing Yahoo Holdings to assume all of Yahoos obligations under the Indenture and the Convertible Notes. The obligations to take such actions will be null and void if the Indenture is amended to permit the Sale Transaction without assumption of the Convertible Notes by Yahoo Holdings, Verizon, or any of their affiliates or if a court determines that the Sale Transaction is not a sale, conveyance, transfer, or lease of all or substantially all of Yahoos properties and assets. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, any payment due by Verizon under the Convertible Notes at maturity or on conversion (including if in Fund shares) will be provided by the Fund, including in the form of a purchase price reduction, and the Fund will indemnify Verizon for any losses or liabilities resulting from the Convertible Notes.

Yahoo and its subsidiaries may not, without Verizons consent, to the extent within Yahoos control, and except as may result in a violation by Yahoo or any of its directors, officers, or employees of applicable law (including fiduciary duties):

Yahoo and its subsidiaries may not implement or effect any of the transfers under the Reorganization Agreement in a manner that would cause a breach or default under, cause the termination of, or give Yahoo Japan the right to terminate the Yahoo Japan License Agreement.

Yahoo and Verizon have agreed that the Excluded Matters shall be disregarded when determining whether the conditions to Verizons obligations to complete the Sale Transaction related to (i) other than with respect to its representation regarding certain user engagement data, the accuracy of certain of Yahoos representations and warranties in the Stock Purchase Agreement (including its representation relating to the absence of a Business Material Adverse Effect), and (ii) Yahoos compliance in all material respects with its covenants in the Stock Purchase Agreement have been satisfied, and Verizon has waived any rights to not close the Sale Transaction or to terminate (or exercise other rights or remedies under) the Stock Purchase Agreement on the basis of any such Excluded Matter.

The Stock Purchase Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflict of law principles.

Yahoo will transfer all of the assets of Yahoo, other than the Excluded Assets, to Yahoo Holdings (the Transferred Assets), including:

Assets to be retained by the Fund, and which will not be transferred to Yahoo Holdings (the Excluded Assets), include the following:

Additionally, Yahoo has the right to specify as Excluded Assets prior to the closing newly acquired assets that (i) are not used, held for use, intended to be used in, otherwise necessary to operate or related to the Business and (ii) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the Funds operations after the completion of the Sale Transaction.

Yahoo Holdings will assume all of the liabilities of Yahoo, other than the Retained Liabilities (the Assumed Liabilities), including:

Liabilities to be retained by the Fund (and which will not be assumed to Yahoo Holdings), referred to as Retained Liabilities, include the following:

With respect to the User Security Liabilities, Yahoo Holdings and Yahoo will each be responsible for 50 percent of any such liabilities arising after the closing, and Yahoo will be responsible for 100 percent of any such liabilities that are finally determined and entered or stipulated against Yahoo or any of its subsidiaries prior to the closing.

In consideration for the Transferred Assets, Yahoo Holdings will, effective as of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, assume and agree to satisfy the Assumed Liabilities.

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in the Reorganization Agreement (see the section of this proxy statement entitled Conditions to Completion of the Reorganization) and unless otherwise agreed between Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, the closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, immediately prior to the completion of the Sale Transaction pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement (see the sections of this proxy statement entitled The Stock Purchase AgreementClosing Date and The Stock Purchase AgreementConditions to Completion of the Sale Transaction). We currently expect the Sale Transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.

In general, the Reorganization Agreement will govern the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of tax contests and audits, and certain other tax matters.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, Yahoo Holdings will generally bear, and indemnify Yahoo and each of its affiliates against, both pre-closing and post-closing taxes attributable to (1) the Business, the Transferred Assets, and the Assumed Liabilities and (2) former operations of Yahoo and its affiliates. Yahoo will generally bear, and indemnify Yahoo Holdings and each of its affiliates against, (1) both pre-closing and post-closing taxes attributable to the Excluded Assets and the Retained Liabilities and (2) any taxes (including transfer taxes) incurred in connection with the Sale Transaction (except that Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings will each be responsible for 50 percent of all taxes imposed on or borne by Yahoo and any of its subsidiaries to the extent such taxes result solely from, and would not have been imposed but for, any of the pre-closing transfers to Yahoo of the equity interests in the Business Subsidiaries to be sold separately to a foreign subsidiary of Verizon pursuant to the Foreign Sale Transaction or the contribution of such equity interests to Foreign SaleCo).

Each of Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings will generally be entitled to any refunds of taxes for which such party is responsible under the Reorganization Agreement. If Yahoo or Yahoo Holdings realizes a tax benefit as a result of an adjustment with respect to taxes for which the other party is responsible under the Reorganization Agreement, the party that realizes the tax benefit will be required to pay the amount of the tax benefit to the other party.

To the extent certain tax attributes attributable to the Excluded Assets and the Retained Liabilities are utilized to reduce taxes for which Yahoo Holdings is responsible under the Reorganization Agreement, Yahoo

Holdings will generally be required to pay Yahoo for the resulting tax benefit. To the extent certain tax attributes attributable to the Business, the Transferred Assets, and the Assumed Liabilities are utilized to reduce taxes for which Yahoo is responsible under the Reorganization Agreement, Yahoo will generally be required to pay Yahoo Holdings for the resulting tax benefit. However, any tax attributes of Yahoo and its affiliates (including the Business Subsidiaries) existing immediately before the Sale Transaction will be utilized first to offset any taxable income or gain recognized by Yahoo in connection with the Sale Transaction, and Yahoo will not be required to make any payments to Yahoo Holdings in respect of such tax attributes.

Following the Sale Transaction, Yahoo Holdings will generally be responsible for preparing (1) all tax returns that include both Yahoo (or any of its affiliates after the Sale Transaction) and any of the Business Subsidiaries, including the U.S. federal income tax return of Yahoo for the year of the Sale Transaction, and (2) all other tax returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Business Subsidiaries. Except for tax returns required to be prepared by Yahoo Holdings, Yahoo will generally be responsible for preparing all tax returns required to be filed by or with respect to Yahoo (or any of its affiliates after the Sale Transaction). The non-preparing party will have certain review and comment rights with respect to tax returns that reflect taxes for which such party is responsible under the Reorganization Agreement.

Each of Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings will generally have the right to control all tax proceedings, including tax audits, for which such party is reasonably expected to bear the greater tax liability (taking into account the parties indemnification obligations under the Reorganization Agreement). To the extent a tax proceeding controlled by Yahoo or Yahoo Holdings could reasonably be expected to materially affect the amount of taxes for which the other party is responsible under the Reorganization Agreement, the non-controlling party will have certain participation and consent rights in connection with the conduct and settlement of such tax proceeding.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Verizon will, and will cause their relevant affiliates to, make joint elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), with respect to the acquisition of any Business Subsidiaries selected by Verizon with respect to which such election is available under applicable law (except for specified Business Subsidiaries).

Conditions to Completion of the Transactions Contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement

Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings obligations under the Reorganization Agreement are subject to the prior or substantially concurrent satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to the completion of the Sale Transaction set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (other than the condition contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement that the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement have been completed and conditions that cannot by their terms be satisfied until the completion of the Sale Transaction, which conditions Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings are reasonably satisfied will be satisfied or waived at the completion of the Sale Transaction). See the section of this proxy statement entitled The Stock Purchase AgreementConditions to Completion of the Sale Transaction.

In the event that Yahoo or Verizon identifies any services provided by Yahoo to the Business, or by the Business to Yahoo, in the six months prior to the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, that are necessary for the operations of the Fund or the Business following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, then Yahoo or Verizon may request, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and agree upon, a customary post-closing transition services agreement.

Termination and Amendment of the Reorganization Agreement

The Reorganization Agreement automatically terminates upon termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement and may be terminated at any time prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization

Agreement by mutual written agreement of Yahoo, Yahoo Holdings, and Verizon. The Reorganization Agreement may not be amended unless in writing signed by Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, subject to Verizons right to consent to such amendment in the event that such amendment would be adverse to the Business, Verizon or any of its subsidiaries, or the Sale Transaction (unless the adverse impact is reasonably expected to be de minimis, in which case only good faith consultation with Verizon is required).

Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of the Reorganization Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms and therefore each party will be entitled to specific performance of the terms of the Reorganization Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity.

On February 20, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments, Yahoo, Yahoo Holdings, and Verizon entered into the Settlement and Release Agreement, pursuant to which Verizon (on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and representatives) released any claims it may have against Yahoo (or its affiliates and representatives) arising out of or relating to the Data Breaches. The waiver and release provided for by the Settlement and Release Agreement does not include (i) obligations under the Settlement and Release Agreement or under the provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement governing the User Security Matters or certain access rights of Verizon relating to certain user engagement data, (ii) indemnification or other obligations with respect to the User Security Liabilities under the Reorganization Agreement, or (iii) any claims under the Stock Purchase Agreement that any Data Breaches (other than Excluded Matters) constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect, or any rights Verizon may have not to close the Sale Transaction or to terminate (or exercise other rights or remedies under) the Stock Purchase Agreement as a result of any Data Breaches (other than Excluded Matters).

Concurrently with the execution of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, Yahoo and Excalibur entered into the Excalibur License Agreement. The Excalibur License Agreement supersedes and replaces a prior patent license agreement between Yahoo and Excalibur, pursuant to which Excalibur had granted Yahoo and certain other affiliates of Yahoo a non-exclusive license under the Excalibur IP Assets, which had been assigned by Yahoo to Excalibur.

The Excalibur License Agreement supersedes the prior patent license agreement between Yahoo and Excalibur in order to provide that Excaliburs grant to Yahoo of a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license under the Excalibur IP Assets will extend, effective upon the closing of the Sale Transaction, to Verizon and its current and certain of its future affiliates. The Excalibur License Agreement will be assigned by Yahoo to Yahoo Holdings upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement.

Amendment to Yahoos Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

The Existing Charter limits the liability of the Companys directors for monetary damages to the extent permitted under Delaware law. The Existing Charter also authorizes the Company to indemnify its agents to the extent permitted by applicable law, subject only to the limits created by applicable Delaware law. The 1940 Act contains additional restrictions on exculpation and indemnification for certain disabling conduct of a director or officer of an investment company. In particular, Section 17(h) of the 1940 Act provides that the organizational documents of an investment company shall not contain any provision that protects a director or officer against any liability to the Fund or its stockholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or

reckless disregard of his or her duties as director or officer. Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, in order to comply with the 1940 Act, the Company will amend the Existing Charter to provide that the exculpation and indemnification provisions of Articles XI and XII of the Existing Charter are subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act with respect to actions taken while the Company is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The proposed certificate of incorporation of the Fund, after giving effect to the Charter Amendment and the change of name of the Company to Altaba Inc., is attached as Exhibit D to this proxy statement.

The Charter Amendment will be approved automatically if Yahoo obtains approval of the Sale Proposal by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. If the Sale Proposal is not so approved, the Charter Amendment will not be effected.

After careful consideration, the Board has declared that the Charter Amendment is advisable. The Board recommends that you vote in favor of the Charter Amendment by voting FOR the Sale Proposal.

Opinions of the Financial Advisors

Pursuant to separate engagement letters, each dated March 23, 2016, the Company retained Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and PJT Partners as financial advisors to the Strategic Review Committee in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives. Each of the engagement letters between Yahoo and the Financial Advisors provides for a transaction fee of $15,000,000 payable to the applicable Financial Advisor in connection with the Sale Transaction, $5,000,000 of which was payable to each Financial Advisor upon the earlier of the public announcement of the Sale Transaction and the delivery by such Financial Advisor of its opinion, and the remainder of which is contingent upon the closing of the Sale Transaction. The initial $5,000,000 payment was made to each of the Financial Advisors upon their delivery of their respective opinions to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in July 2016 in connection with the execution of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements. In addition, at the sole discretion of the Strategic Review Committee, a discretionary fee of up to $2,500,000 may be payable to each of the Financial Advisors. Yahoo has agreed to reimburse each Financial Advisor for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify each Financial Advisor against certain liabilities arising out of such Financial Advisors engagement.

At a special meeting of the Board held on February 20, 2017, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and PJT Partners rendered their respective opinions to the Strategic Review Committee and to the Board, as of the dates of such opinions and based upon and subject to the factors set forth therein, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo of the Cash Consideration, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, as described in more detail below:

At the February 20, 2017 Board meeting, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 20, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs written opinion, the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 20, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Exhibit E to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the opinion of Goldman Sachs set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Yahoo stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in connection with their consideration of the Sale Transaction.

The issuance of Goldman Sachs opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Yahoo stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Sale Transaction or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition, and future prospects of Yahoos operating business, including regarding their assessment of the potential financial impact of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches; compared certain financial information for Yahoos operating business and certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar financial and stock market information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the digital media industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other information provided to, discussed with, or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and the Strategic Review Committee. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative, or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including Yahoo Holdings or Yahoos operating business and, except for being furnished with appraisals of certain real estate assets of the Company, Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory, or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Sale Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the expected benefits of the Sale Transaction in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the Sale Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Sale Transaction, including its decision to enter into the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment, the Reorganization Agreement Amendment or the Settlement and Release Agreement, or the relative merits of the Sale Transaction as compared to any other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the Company, as of the date thereof, of the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Sale Transaction Agreements, the Settlement and Release Agreement or the Sale Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Sale Transaction Agreements or the Settlement and Release Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Sale Transaction, the Indenture, any indemnification or other ongoing obligations of the Company, including in respect of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches or any expenses related thereto, any allocation of the consideration (including between the Cash Consideration and the RSU Substitution), the fairness of the Sale Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors, or employees of the Company or Yahoo Holdings, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Sale Transaction, whether relative to the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of the Companys common stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the Sale Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company, Yahoo Holdings, or Verizon or the ability of the Company, Yahoo Holdings, or Verizon to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market, and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising, or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments, or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in connection with their consideration of the Sale Transaction and its opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Sale Transaction or any other matter. Goldman Sachs opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

The terms of the Sale Transaction were determined through arms-length negotiations between the Company and Verizon and were recommended by the Strategic Review Committee for approval by, and were approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company, the Strategic Review Committee, or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Sale Transaction.

Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management, and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold, or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, and other financial instruments of the Company, Verizon, any of their respective affiliates, and third parties or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Sale Transaction. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Sale Transaction. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Verizon and/or its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a lead dealer manager with respect to 18 private offers to exchange specified series of debt

securities of Verizon for new debt securities of Verizon and cash in February 2017; as joint bookrunner with respect to a public offering by Verizon of $400,000,000 of Floating Rate notes due 2019, $1,000,000,000 of 1.375% Notes due 2019, $1,000,000,000 of 1.750% Notes due 2021, $2,250,000,000 of 2.625% Notes due 2026, and $1,500,000,000 of 4.125% Notes due 2046 in August 2016; as a lead dealer manager and a lead solicitation agent with respect to three cash tender offers on behalf of Verizon and certain of its subsidiaries in April 2016; as financial advisor to AOL in connection with its acquisition of Millennial Media in October 2015; as a lead dealer manager with respect to seven private offers to exchange specified series of debt securities of Verizon and one of its subsidiaries for new debt securities of Verizon and cash in March 2015; as a co-lead underwriter with respect to a public offering by Verizon of 2.625% Notes due 2031 (aggregate principal amount of 1,000,000,000) and 1.625% Notes due 2024 (aggregate principal amount of 1,400,000,000) in December 2014; and as a dealer in respect of Verizons commercial paper program commencing in 2006. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Verizon, Yahoo Holdings and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. During the two year period ended February 20, 2017, Goldman Sachs has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Verizon and/or its affiliates of approximately $27.2 million and to Yahoo and/or its affiliates of approximately $9.5 million.

In addition, Goldman Sachs, acting as principal, is a counterparty to the Company with respect to convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the Companys sale of its Convertible Notes (aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.4 billion) and with respect to issuer warrant transactions entered into contemporaneously with such Convertible Note hedge transactions. Assuming that the note hedge and warrant transactions are not otherwise terminated pursuant to their terms, the issuer warrant transactions may be adjusted by Goldman Sachs, as calculation agent, if Goldman Sachs determines that an event has occurred that gives it the right to make an adjustment and an adjustment is necessary to preserve the fair value of the issuer warrant transactions to Goldman Sachs in light of the effect of the announcement and/or completion of the Sale Transaction on the theoretical value of the Companys shares or such issuer warrant transactions. Such adjustments may compensate Goldman Sachs for any diminution in the value of the issuer warrant transactions to it that would otherwise result from the announcement and/or completion of the Sale Transaction.

In connection with such Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions, Goldman Sachs has exposure to market fluctuations in the price of the Companys common stock. Goldman Sachs ordinary practice is to hedge its net market exposure to the price of the common stock underlying private derivative transactions with issuers of such common stock such as the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions. In connection with such transactions, Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have engaged, and will continue to engage, in hedging and other market transactions (which may include purchasing or selling the Companys common stock and the entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the Companys common stock) that are generally intended to substantially neutralize Goldman Sachs risk exposure as a result of the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions. At the close of business on April 20, 2017, Goldman Sachs hedge positions in respect of the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions included approximately 1.7 million shares of Yahoo common stock, as well as other derivatives referencing Yahoo securities. Goldman Sachs is expected to continue to engage in hedging activities in accordance with applicable law to mitigate its exposure to market fluctuations in the price of the Companys common stock resulting from the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions.

Such hedging activity has been, and will be, at Goldman Sachs own risk and may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions. The amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions have been fully exercised, expired, or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities. Goldman Sachs informed the Company that a portion of the amount of any such gain or loss, including any termination payment, may be shared with Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division.

Whether the Sale Transaction results in adjustments, exercises, and/or terminations of the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions and the amount of payments or deliveries to be made upon ultimate exercise, expiration, or termination of the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions will depend on a number of factors, including how the Sale Transaction is treated under the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions as documented. As such factors change, and as Goldman Sachs has hedged its position under such transactions, the completion of the Sale Transaction could result in ultimate payments to or from Goldman Sachs that are greater than, equal to, or less than the amount of the payments that would have been received or paid by Goldman Sachs upon exercise, expiration, or termination of the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions in the absence of the Sale Transaction.

In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its Securities Division who are undertaking these hedging and other market transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a result of preparation of disclosures to the Company of Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Divisions economic interests in the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions, persons in Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division may have received or may receive input into how to model, or reports of historical measures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs and/or Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Divisions profit and/or loss over certain measurement periods related to the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions.

Prior to the determinations by the Strategic Review Committee and the Board with respect to approval of the Sale Transaction, Goldman Sachs also provided the Company and the Board with certain estimates and analyses concerning the impact of the Sale Transaction on the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions, based on theoretical models and various assumptions concerning the terms of the Sale Transaction and market conditions and other information available at the time. Such estimates and analyses were prepared by the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs without consultation with the derivatives trading personnel responsible for Goldman Sachss position as principal in the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions.

The Strategic Review Committee selected Goldman Sachs as one of its financial advisors because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Sale Transaction, as well as its and its familiarity and prior experience with the Company, including with respect to the Aabaco spin-off.

At the February 20, 2017 Board meeting, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo. J.P. Morgan confirmed its February 20, 2017 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board, dated February 20, 2017, that, as of such date, the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo.

The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated February 20, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Exhibit F to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Yahoo stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgans written opinion was addressed to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board (in their capacities as such) in connection with and for the purposes of their evaluation of

the Sale Transaction. The issuance of J.P. Morgans opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Yahoo stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Sale Transaction or any other matter.

In connection with preparing its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:

In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Sale Transaction, and the past and current business operations of Yahoos operating business, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Yahoos operating business, including making inquiries of certain members of the management of the Company regarding their assessment of the potential financial impact of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or, with the exception of being provided with appraisals of certain real estate assets (which J.P. Morgan did not use in giving its opinion), was not provided with, any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor has J.P. Morgan evaluated the solvency of the Company, Yahoo Holdings, or Verizon under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar matters.

In relying on financial analyses and Forecasts provided to the Financial Advisors or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they had been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Yahoos operating business to which such analyses or Forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or Forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Sale Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Sale Transaction Agreements will have the tax consequences described in discussions with, and materials furnished to J.P. Morgan by, representatives of the

Company and will be consummated as described in the Sale Transaction Agreements and that the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments and the Settlement and Release Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the drafts thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and Verizon in the Sale Transaction Agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis, that the Company will have no exposure under any indemnification obligations contained within the Sale Transaction Agreements, including in respect of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches, in any amount material to its analysis, and that the adjustments to the cash consideration as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement based on the value of the Yahoo RSU awards outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the closing of the Sale Transaction and the amounts of Yahoo Holdings working capital, cash, indebtedness, and transaction expenses as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement will not result in any adjustment to the consideration that is material to J.P. Morgans analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory, or tax expert and has relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory, or other consents and approvals necessary for the completion of the Sale Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company, Yahoo Holdings or Yahoos operating business, or on the contemplated benefits of the Sale Transaction.

J.P. Morgans opinion is necessarily based on economic, market, and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of its opinion. J.P. Morgans opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgans opinion and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. J.P. Morgans opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, and J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Sale Transaction to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or Yahoo Holdings or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Sale Transaction. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Sale Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

The terms of the Sale Transaction Agreements were determined through arms-length negotiations between the Company and Verizon and were recommended by the Strategic Review Committee for approval by, and were approved by the Board, and the decision to enter into the Sale Transaction Agreements was solely that of the Board. J.P. Morgans opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in their evaluation of the Sale Transaction and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Strategic Review Committee, the Board, or the Companys management with respect to the Sale Transaction or the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Strategic Review Committee in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity and prior experience with the Company and the industries in which it operates.

During the two year period ended February 20, 2017, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company and Verizon, for which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received compensation for services to Verizon and/or its affiliates of approximately $32 million and to Yahoo and/or its affiliates of approximately $12 million. Such services during such period have included acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with its strategic planning in 2015 and have included acting as a joint bookrunner on Verizons bond offering in October 2016, and acting as financial advisor to Verizon in connection with its sale of a portfolio of cellphone towers to American Tower in February 2015.

In addition, as J.P. Morgan previously advised the Strategic Review Committee and the Company, one of J.P. Morgans affiliates (x) sold to the Company convertible note hedge options relating to the Companys common stock in connection with the Companys sale of the Convertible Notes and (y) purchased from the Company warrants relating to the Companys common stock contemporaneously with the sale of such convertible note hedge options. J.P. Morgans affiliate entered into these transactions, and is acting thereunder, as principal for its own account and not as an advisor to the Company. Assuming that the note hedge and warrant transactions are not otherwise terminated pursuant to their terms, the warrants may be adjusted by J.P. Morgans affiliate, as calculation agent, if J.P. Morgans affiliate determines that an event has occurred that gives it the right to make an adjustment and an adjustment is necessary to preserve the fair value of the issuer warrant transactions to such affiliate in light of the effect of the announcement and/or completion of the Sale Transaction on the theoretical value of the Companys shares or such issuer warrant transactions. Such adjustments may compensate J.P. Morgans affiliate for any diminution in the value of the issuer warrant transactions to it that would otherwise result from the announcement and/or completion of the Sale Transaction.

In connection with such convertible note hedge options and warrants, J.P. Morgans affiliate has exposure to market fluctuations in the price of the Companys common stock. Such affiliates ordinary practice is to hedge its net market exposure to the price of the common stock underlying private derivative transactions with issuers of such common stock such as the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions. In connection with such transactions, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have engaged, and will continue to engage, in hedging and other market transactions (which may include purchasing or selling the Companys common stock and the entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the Companys common stock) that are generally intended to substantially neutralize J.P. Morgans affiliates risk exposure as a result of the Convertible Note hedge options and issuer warrants. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are expected to continue to engage in hedging activities in accordance with applicable law to mitigate their exposure to market fluctuations in the price of the Companys common stock resulting from the Convertible Note hedge options and issuer warrants.

Such hedging activity has been, and will be, at J.P. Morgans own risk and may result in a gain or loss to J.P. Morgan and its affiliates that may be greater than or less than the contractual benefit to J.P. Morgan and its affiliates under the Convertible Note hedge options and issuer warrants. The amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until such transactions have been fully exercised, expired, or terminated in accordance with their terms and J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities. J.P. Morgan informed the Company that a portion of the amount of any such gain or loss, including any termination payment, may be shared with J.P. Morgans Investment Banking Division.

Whether the Sale Transaction results in adjustments, exercises, and/or terminations of the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions and the amount of payments or deliveries to be made upon ultimate exercise, expiration, or termination of the Convertible Note hedge options and issuer warrants will depend on a number of factors, including how the Sale Transaction is treated under the Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions as documented. As such factors change, and as J.P. Morgans affiliate has hedged its position under such transactions, the completion of the Sale Transaction could result in ultimate payments to or from J.P. Morgans affiliate that are greater than, equal to, or less than the amount of the payments that would have been received or paid by J.P. Morgans affiliate upon exercise, expiration, or termination of such Convertible Note hedge and issuer warrant transactions in the absence of the Sale Transaction.

In accordance with industry practice, J.P. Morgan maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by investment banking personnel to the personnel who are undertaking these hedging and other market transactions.

Prior to the Companys entry into the Stock Purchase Agreement, J.P. Morgan also provided the Company and the Board with certain estimates and analyses concerning the impact of the proposed transaction on the Convertible Note hedge options and issuer warrants, based on theoretical models and various assumptions concerning the terms of the proposed transaction and market conditions and other information available at the

time. Such estimates and analyses were prepared by investment banking personnel without consultation with the derivatives trading personnel responsible for J.P. Morgans affiliates position as principal in the Convertible Note hedge options and issuer warrants.

In addition, J.P. Morgans commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Verizon, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than one percent of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and Verizon. In the ordinary course of J.P. Morgans businesses, J.P. Morgan and is affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or Verizon for its own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, J.P. Morgan may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

At the February 20, 2017 Board meeting, PJT Partners rendered to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 20, 2017, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in PJT Partners written opinion, the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo.

The full text of the written opinion of PJT Partners, dated February 20, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Exhibit G to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the opinion of PJT Partners set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Yahoo stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. PJT Partners provided its opinion to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board (in their capacities as such) in connection with and for purposes of their evaluation of the Sale Transaction only and PJT Partners opinion is not a recommendation as to any action the Strategic Review Committee or the Board should take with respect to the Sale Transaction or any aspect thereof. The issuance of PJT Partners opinion was approved by a fairness committee of PJT Partners in accordance with established procedures. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Yahoo stockholder as to how any such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Sale Transaction or any other matter.

In arriving at its opinion, PJT Partners, among other things:

In preparing its opinion, with the consent of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board, PJT Partners relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information and all other information discussed with or reviewed by PJT Partners, without independent verification thereof. For purposes of PJT Partners opinion delivered on July 22, 2016, in connection with the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, the Financial Advisors were provided by the management of the Company with certain internal financial analyses, estimate and forecasts and certain terminal year assumptions relating to Yahoos operating business, which the Financial Advisors were directed to use by the Strategic Review Committee. In connection with preparing PJT Partners opinion delivered on February 20, 2017, the Financial Advisors were provided by the management of the Company with the Forecasts and certain terminal year assumptions relating to Yahoos operating business, which the Financial Advisors were directed to use by the Board. PJT Partners assumed with the consent of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board that such Forecasts and the assumptions underlying such Forecasts, and all other financial analyses, estimates and forecasts provided to the Financial Advisors by the management of the Company, have been reasonably prepared in accordance with industry practice and represent managements best currently available estimates and judgments as to the business and operations and future financial performance of Yahoos operating business. PJT Partners assumed no responsibility for and expressed no opinion as to the Forecasts, the assumptions upon which they are based, or any other financial analyses, estimates, and forecasts provided to the Financial Advisors by the management of the Company. PJT Partners also assumed that there had been no material changes in the assets, financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects of Yahoos operating business since the respective dates of the last financial statements made available to the Financial Advisors. PJT Partners relied on representations and/or projections provided by the management of the Company regarding taxable income, standalone net operating loss utilization, and other tax attributes of Yahoos operating business. PJT Partners further relied with the consent of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts that would make the information and projections provided by them inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading.

PJT Partners was not asked to undertake, and did not undertake, an independent verification of any information provided to or reviewed by PJT Partners, nor was PJT Partners furnished with any such verification and PJT Partners did not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. PJT Partners did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets of the Company or Yahoo Holdings. PJT Partners did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or the liabilities (including any contingent, derivative, or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor, with the exception of being furnished with appraisals of certain real estate assets (which PJT Partners did not use in preparing its opinion), was PJT Partners furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals, nor has PJT Partners evaluated the solvency of the Company, Yahoo Holdings, or Verizon under any applicable laws.

PJT Partners also assumed with the consent of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board that the final executed forms of the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments would not differ in any material respects from drafts reviewed by PJT Partners and the completion of the Sale Transaction will be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Sale Transaction Agreements, without waiver, modification, or amendment of any material term, condition, or agreement, and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party

consents and approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the Sale Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction, or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company, Yahoo Holdings or Yahoos operating business or the contemplated benefits of the Sale Transaction. PJT Partners also assumed that the Company will have no exposure under any indemnification obligations contained in the Sale Transaction Agreements, including in respect of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches, in any amount material to its analysis, and that the adjustments to the consideration based on the value of the Yahoo RSU awards outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the closing of the Sale Transaction and the amounts of the Yahoo Holdings working capital, cash, indebtedness, and transaction expenses as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement will not result in any adjustment to the consideration that is material to PJT Partners analysis. PJT Partners did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Sale Transaction, nor does PJT Partners opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory, or accounting matters, as to which PJT Partners understood that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. PJT Partners are not legal, tax, or regulatory advisors and have relied upon without independent verification the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, and regulatory advisors with respect to such matters.

In arriving at its opinion, PJT Partners did not consider the relative merits of the Sale Transaction as compared to any other business plan or opportunity that might be available to the Company, or the effect of any other arrangement in which the Company might engage, and PJT Partners opinion does not address the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Sale Transaction, including its decision to enter into the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments or the Settlement and Release Agreement. PJT Partners opinion is limited to the fairness as of the date thereof, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo of the Cash Consideration to be paid in the Sale Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, and PJT Partners opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the Sale Transaction, the Sale Transaction Agreements, the Settlement and Release Agreement or any other agreement or understanding entered into in connection with the Sale Transaction or otherwise. PJT Partners further expressed no opinion or view as to the fairness of the Sale Transaction to the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Sale Transaction. PJT Partners also expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Companys or Yahoo Holdings officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration or otherwise. PJT Partners opinion is necessarily based upon economic, market, monetary, regulatory, and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated, and the information made available to it, as of the date of its opinion. PJT Partners expressed no opinion as to the prices or trading ranges at which the shares of the Companys common stock will trade at any time.

PJT Partners opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Yahoo stockholder as to how any such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Sale Transaction or any other matter. PJT Partners assumes no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of its opinion. PJT Partners opinion was approved by a fairness committee of PJT Partners in accordance with established procedures.

As part of its investment banking business, PJT Partners is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes and other valuations for corporate and other purposes. PJT Partners was selected as a financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee with respect to the Sale Transaction on the basis of PJT Partners experience and its familiarity with the industry in which the Company operates.

In the ordinary course of PJT Partners and its affiliates businesses, PJT Partners and its affiliates may provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Verizon and may receive compensation for the rendering of these services. During the two year period ending on the date of its opinion, PJT Partners acted as financial advisor to Verizon in connection with its sale of a portfolio of wireline assets to Frontier Communications Corporation announced in February 2015, its acquisition of Telogis Inc. announced in June 2016, and its acquisition of Fleetmatics Group, PLC announced in August 2016. For its financial advisory

services to Verizon in connection with these transactions, PJT Partners received compensation in an aggregate amount of approximately $19 million. PJT Partners may also in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company, Yahoo Holdings, Verizon, and their respective affiliates for which it may receive compensation.

Summary of the Financial Analyses of the Financial Advisors

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by the Financial Advisors to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board on February 19, 2017 in connection with rendering their respective opinions described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by the Financial Advisors, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by the Financial Advisors. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of the Financial Advisors financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 17, 2017 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

The analyses described below were jointly prepared by the Financial Advisors for purposes of each of the Financial Advisors providing the opinions to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board described above. Those analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Because those analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, the Board, the Strategic Review Committee, the Financial Advisors, or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

For purposes of this section of this proxy statement, the Financial Advisors assumed total consideration to be received in the Sale Transaction by the Company of $5,142 million, which was calculated as the sum of (i) an amount equal to the base purchase price (ii) the tax adjusted value of the unvested Yahoo RSU awards to be replaced with Verizon RSU awards pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement based on an assumed 40 percent tax rate and the trailing-three day volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock as of July 22, 2016.

Goldman Sachs also assumed that the estimated amounts of Yahoo Holdings working capital, cash, indebtedness, and transaction expenses relied upon by Goldman Sachs in connection with its financial analyses reflected the then best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company, which estimates would not result in any adjustment to the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Company in the Sale Transaction material to Goldman Sachs analysis.

The Financial Advisors reviewed and compared certain financial information for Yahoos operating business to corresponding financial information, ratios, and public market multiples for the following publicly traded Internet companies (collectively, the Selected Companies):

Although none of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to Yahoos operating business, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that for purposes of the Financial Advisors analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Yahoos operating business.

The Financial Advisors also calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on financial data as of February 17, 2017 and information it obtained from SEC filings. The multiples and ratios of Yahoos operating business were calculated using information provided by the Companys management. The multiples and ratios for each of the Selected Companies were calculated using the most recent publicly available information. With respect to the Selected Companies, the Financial Advisors calculated:

The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

For purposes of the analysis, (i) certain non-recurring items consisting of (a) patent licensing contributions expiring in 2019 and (b) marketing services revenue from Yahoo Japan expiring in August 2017 (collectively, the Non-Recurring Items) were excluded from Yahoos operating business 2017 EBITDA, 2017 EBITDA Minus SBC, and 2017 EBITDA Minus Capex (for more information on the amount of each Non-Recurring Item, see the section of this proxy statement entitled Certain Financial Forecasts) and (ii) each range of illustrative standalone enterprise values was adjusted to include the net present value of the Non-Recurring Items. The Financial Advisors calculated the net present value of the Non-Recurring Items by applying a discount rate of 10 percent to the Non-Recurring Items provided by the Company. Using the results of this analysis and the Financial Advisors professional judgment and experience, the Financial Advisors selected a 2017 EBITDA reference range of 5.0x to 8.0x for Yahoos operating business. This multiple reference range was applied to Yahoos operating business 2017 EBITDA provided by the Companys management to the Financial Advisors to derive a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $3,850 million to $6,100 million. Using the results of this analysis and the Financial Advisors professional judgment and experience, the Financial Advisors selected a 2017 EBITDA Minus SBC reference range of 8.0x to 11.0x for Yahoos operating business. This multiple reference range was applied to Yahoos operating business 2017 EBITDA Minus SBC provided by the Companys management to the Financial Advisors to derive a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $2,850 million to $3,850 million. Using the results of this analysis and the Financial Advisors professional judgment and experience, the Financial Advisors selected a 2017 EBITDA Minus Capex reference range of 8.0x to 11.0x for Yahoos operating business. This multiple reference range was applied to Yahoos operating business 2017 EBITDA Minus Capex provided by the Companys management to the Financial

Advisors to derive a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $3,700 million to $5,025 million. In each case, the standalone enterprise values were rounded to the nearest $25 million.

Using the Forecasts and certain terminal year assumptions relating to Yahoos operating business provided by management (and approved by, and used by the Financial Advisors at the direction of, the Board), the Financial Advisors performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Yahoos operating business. Using discount rates, in the case of J.P. Morgan and PJT Partners, ranging from 8.75 percent to 10.75 percent and, in the case of Goldman Sachs, ranging from 9.5 percent to 11.5 percent, in each case, reflecting estimates of Yahoos operating business weighted average cost of capital, the Financial Advisors discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016 (i) estimates of EBITDA less stock based compensation, less cash taxes, less capital expenditures, less change in net working capital, plus the Non-Recurring Items (Unlevered Free Cash Flow) for Yahoos operating business for the years January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Yahoos operating business, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from two percent to four percent, to the calendar year 2019 estimate of revenue (excluding the Non-Recurring Items)) to be generated by Yahoos operating business to determine free cash flow, reflecting the assumptions provided by management of the Company. The Financial Advisors derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Yahoos operating business by adding the present values derived pursuant to clause (i) and clause (ii) of the preceding sentence. J.P. Morgans and PJT Partners analysis derived a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $2,025 million to $3,750 million. Goldman Sachs analysis derived a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $1,875 million to $3,250 million. In each case, the standalone enterprise values were rounded to the nearest $25 million.

The Financial Advisors analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions involving public Internet companies with a transaction value over $1 billion since January 2012.

For each of the selected transactions, the Financial Advisors calculated and compared the targets enterprise value as a multiple of the targets estimated EBITDA for the forward-looking 12-month period immediately following the date the relevant transaction was announced (NTM EBITDA), and the targets enterprise value as a multiple of the targets estimated EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, for the forward-looking 12-month period immediately following the date the relevant transaction was announced (NTM EBITDA Minus SBC). While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Yahoos operating business, the companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Yahoos operating business results, market size, and product profile.

The following table presents the results of this analysis:

For purposes of the analysis, (i) the Non-Recurring Items were excluded from Yahoos operating business NTM EBITDA and NTM EBITDA Minus SBC (for more information on the amount of each Non-Recurring Item, see the section of this proxy statement entitled Certain Financial Forecasts,) and (ii) each range of illustrative standalone enterprise values was adjusted to include the net present value of the Non-Recurring Items. The Financial Advisors calculated the net present value of the Non-Recurring Items by applying a discount rate of 10 percent to the Non-Recurring Items provided by the Company. Using the results of this analysis, the Financial Advisors applied the NTM EBITDA multiple range for the selected transactions to Yahoos operating business NTM EBITDA estimate provided by management of the Company to the Financial Advisors and derived a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $5,200 million to $6,375 million. Using the results of this analysis, the Financial Advisors applied the NTM EBITDA Minus SBC multiple range for the selected transactions to Yahoos operating business NTM EBITDA Minus SBC estimate provided by management of the Company to the Financial Advisors and derived a range of illustrative standalone enterprise values for Yahoos operating business of $2,950 million to $3,375 million. In each case, the standalone enterprise values were rounded to the nearest $25 million.

Yahoo does not, as a matter of course, develop or publicly disclose long-term projections due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, at the Boards request, in connection with its review of strategic alternatives, Yahoos management prepared three years of forecasted financial information for the Company. Such forecasted financial information was presented to and reviewed by the Board on March 14, 2016 and was thereafter provided to potential bidders in connection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction. Yahoos management updated such forecasted financial information in July 2016, based on more recent information, to (i) reduce capital expenditure amounts for 2016 from $450 million to $350 million, based on actual expenditures during 2016 and (ii) reduce stock-based compensation (SBC) for 2018 from $452 million to $400 million. Yahoo provided this updated information to the Financial Advisors for purposes of the financial analyses and fairness opinions provided to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in connection with their consideration of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements. In connection with the Strategic Review Committees and the Boards consideration of the Sale Transaction Agreement Amendments and the Settlement and Release Agreement, Yahoos management further updated such forecasted financial information in February 2017, (i) to remove forecasted financial information for 2016, as that year had been completed and actual results were known, (ii) to reflect more recent information with respect to 2017 and 2018 given that more than six months had passed since the execution of the Original Sale Transaction Agreements, and (iii) to include forecasted financial information for fiscal year 2019, and provided such updated information to the Financial Advisors. This updated information did not include estimates of potential non-recurring costs and expenses related to the Security Incidents.

The February 2017 updated forecasted financial information differed from the forecasted financial information provided to the Financial Advisors in July 2016 as follows:

Based on this information and additional input from Yahoos management, the Financial Advisors prepared terminal year forecasts, which were reviewed by Yahoos management and the Strategic Review Committee. The updated forecasted financial information and the terminal year forecasts (the Forecasts) were approved by Yahoos management, the Strategic Review Committee and the Board for use by the Financial Advisors in performing their financial analyses, which were presented to the Strategic Review Committee and the Board by the Financial Advisors and are summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled Opinions of the Financial Advisors. The Forecasts were reviewed by Yahoos management with, and considered by, the Strategic Review Committee and the Board in connection with their evaluation, recommendation, and approval of the Sale Transaction.

The Forecasts were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and the summary thereof is included in this proxy statement only because such information was made available as described above. The Forecasts were not prepared with a view to compliance with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Furthermore, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent auditor, has not examined, reviewed, compiled, or otherwise applied procedures to, the Forecasts and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report included in Yahoos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, relates to the Companys historical financial information. It does not extend to the forecasted financial information and should not be read to do so. The Forecasts were prepared solely for internal use of Yahoo and the Financial Advisors and are subjective in many respects.

Although the Forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events that our management believed were reasonable at the time the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to our management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not to be achieved include general economic conditions, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, and changes in tax laws. As the Forecasts are forward-looking statements, see also the section of this proxy statement entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Sale Transaction. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Forecasts. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Strategic Review Committee, the Board, Yahoo, the Financial Advisors, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, that actual future results will necessarily reflect the Forecasts. The Forecasts are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Sale Proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Sale Transaction.

The Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding Yahoo contained in our public filings with the SEC.

Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or otherwise revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date the

Forecasts were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to be in error.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Forecasts, Yahoo stockholders are cautioned not to unduly rely on the Forecasts included in this proxy statement.

Certain of the measures included in the Forecasts may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Yahoo may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.

Reconciliations between Non-GAAP Forecasted Financial Metrics and Comparable GAAP Metrics

The following table presents reconciling items between certain of the forecasted non-GAAP metrics above and the most comparable GAAP metrics:

Revenue ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP revenue less TAC that has been recorded as a cost of revenue. TAC consists of payments made to Yahoos distribution network of third-party entities who integrate Yahoos advertising offerings into their websites or other offerings as well as payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to Yahoos online properties and services. TAC is recorded either as a reduction to revenue or as cost of revenue.

In general, Yahoo presents revenue ex-TAC in its earnings announcements and in the periodic reports it files with the SEC in order to provide investors a metric used by Yahoo for evaluation and decision-making purposes and to provide investors with comparable revenue numbers when comparing to its historical reported financial information. A limitation of revenue ex-TAC is that it is a measure Yahoo defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to it, and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of Yahoos results to those of other companies in its industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of revenue and cost of revenueTAC.

EBITDA (excl. SBC) is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income (loss) attributable to Yahoo before taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, SBC expense, restructuring, other income (expense), net (which includes interest), earnings in equity interests, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. EBITDA (excl. SBC) is a metric Yahoo uses for evaluation and decision-making purposes and is similar to the Adjusted EBITDA metric Yahoo reports in its earnings announcements and in the periodic reports it files with the SEC. EBITDA (excl. SBC and selected non-recurring items) also excludes selected income streams that will

expire prior to the end of the final period presented above, namely contribution of patent licensing and Yahoo Japan marketing services revenue.

EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported under GAAP. These limitations include: EBITDA does not reflect tax payments and such payments reflect a reduction in cash available to Yahoo; EBITDA does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used by Yahoo in generating revenues in its businesses; EBITDA (excl. SBC) does not include stock-based compensation expense related to Yahoos workforce; EBITDA also excludes other income (expense), net (which includes interest), earnings in equity interests, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and these items may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to Yahoo; and the adjusted EBITDA metrics are measures that may be unique to Yahoo, and therefore may not enhance the comparability of Yahoos results to other companies in its industry. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) attributable to Yahoo, which includes taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, other income (expense), net (which includes interest), earnings in equity interests, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Forecasts present free cash flow by reference to earnings before interest after taxes (which is presented net of SBC expense), whereas the reconciliation table above presents reconciling items between free cash flow and net cash provided by operating activities (which Yahoo considers to be the most comparable GAAP measure).

In relation to net cash provided by operating activities, the forecasted free cash flow would be defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (adjusted to include excess tax benefits from stock-based awards), less SBC, acquisition of property and equipment, net (i.e., acquisition of property and equipment less proceeds received from disposition of property and equipment, including land) and dividends received from equity investees.

For purposes of the Forecasts, free cash flow is defined differently than the free cash flow that appears in Yahoos earnings announcements and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Specifically, for purposes of the Forecasts, free cash flow is presented net of SBC expense. By contrast, SBC is not included as a cash cost in Yahoos historical presentations of free cash flow. The Forecasts definition presented above therefore yields a result that is lower (by the amount of SBC) than the result yielded by Yahoos traditional definition.

In general, Yahoo presents free cash flow (a liquidity measure) in its earnings announcements and in the periodic reports it files with the SEC in order to provide investors a metric used by it for evaluation and decisionmaking purposes and to provide investors with information about the amount of cash generated by business operations, after deducting its net payments for acquisitions and dispositions of property and equipment, which cash can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including, among others, investing in its business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in Yahoos consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.

EBIT and Earnings Before Interest After Taxes

The forecasted financial information presented above also includes the non-GAAP measures of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), which is net of SBC expense, and earnings before interest after taxes, which is also net of SBC expense. Historically, Yahoo has not presented these measures in its earnings announcements

or periodic SEC reports, but they are included above because they were provided to the Financial Advisors for purposes of their financial analyses.

Yahoo and Verizon agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain antitrust approvals for the Sale Transaction. These approvals include the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the HSR Act) and certain regulatory clearances and approvals in certain jurisdictions, including the European Union. Yahoo and Verizons obligations to complete the Sale Transaction are subject to the approval, expiration, or termination of waiting periods (including any extensions) required under the antitrust laws of certain jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition, unless Verizon expressly agrees in writing to such Burdensome Condition in connection with obtaining such approval, expiration, or termination. All such approvals, expirations, or terminations have been obtained or have occurred, as applicable.

The Sale Transaction is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which provides that certain transactions may not be completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), and until certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Each of Verizon and Yahoo filed a Pre-merger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC in connection with the Sale Transaction on August 12, 2016. The waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 12, 2016.

Although the applicable waiting period has expired or terminated, the DOJ, the FTC, state attorneys general, and others still may challenge the Sale Transaction on antitrust grounds. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the Sale Transaction, any of the DOJ, the FTC, or others could take action under the antitrust laws, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the Sale Transaction or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. Neither Verizon nor Yahoo believes that the Sale Transaction violates U.S. antitrust laws, but there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Sale Transaction on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

Yahoo and Verizon derive revenues in other jurisdictions where acquisition control filings or clearances are or may be required or advisable. In addition to the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Sale Transaction is conditioned upon the antitrust approval from certain jurisdictions, including the European Union. These approvals were obtained in December 2016.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Sale Transaction

In considering the recommendations of the Board with respect to the Sale Proposal, Yahoo stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of Yahoo have interests in the Sale Transaction that may be different from or in addition to the interests of Yahoo stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Sale Transaction Agreements and in recommending that you approve the Sale Proposal. For purposes of all of the agreements and plans described below, the completion of the Sale Transaction will constitute a change of control, change in control, or term of similar meaning. See the section of this proxy statement entitled Background of the Sale Transaction and the section of this proxy statement entitled Reasons for the Sale Transaction. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative and the table below. The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date.

Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to indemnify its officers, directors, and certain other persons to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in such section.

The Existing Charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director shall not be personally liable to Yahoo or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Yahoo is also authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) agents (and any other persons to which Delaware law permits Yahoo to provide indemnification) through bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement of expenses otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to actions for breach of a duty to Yahoo, its stockholders, and others. The Fund will retain liability for all indemnification obligations with respect to current and former directors and officers of Yahoo and current and former directors and officers of Yahoo Holdings and its subsidiaries (i) arising from acts and omissions relating to the Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities or (ii) in their respective capacities as directors and/or officers of Yahoo. This indemnification and related insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled D&O Indemnification and Insurance.

With the exception of our founder David Filo, all of Yahoos directors and executive officers hold one or more options to purchase shares of Yahoo common stock (which we refer to as Yahoo stock options) and/or Yahoo RSU awards, as shown in the table below. Yahoo stock options and Yahoo RSU awards will be treated as follows:

Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, each Yahoo RSU award that, immediately prior to the closing, is outstanding, unvested, and held by an employee of Yahoo Holdings (or a subsidiary thereof), who will automatically become an employee of Verizon (or a subsidiary thereof) immediately following the closing, generally will be replaced with a cash-settled Verizon RSU award. The number of shares of Verizon common stock subject to each Verizon RSU award will be equal to the number of shares of Yahoo common stock subject to the corresponding Yahoo RSU award multiplied by the ratio of the average trading price of Yahoo common stock during the three-day period preceding the day before the closing date over the average trading price of Verizon common stock during the three-day period immediately following the closing date. Verizon may determine, however, that some non-U.S. employees replacement Verizon RSU awards will be stock-settled (rather than cash-settled) in limited circumstances. Yahoo RSU awards subject to performance-based vesting will similarly be replaced with performance-based cash-settled Verizon RSU awards, with both the annual target number of shares and the annual maximum number of shares adjusted according to the above ratio; however, shares allocated to the performance year in which the closing occurs will be replaced based on target performance only (and the replacement Verizon RSU awards for that year will not be performance-based) and shares allocated to future performance years will be subject to such performance-based vesting criteria as may be established by Verizon. All replacement Verizon RSU awards will otherwise be subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding Yahoo RSU awards.

Yahoo RSU awards held by Yahoo non-employee directors and individuals who are employees of the Fund as of immediately following the closing will not be replaced with Verizon RSU awards and will instead vest in full in accordance with the terms of the applicable Yahoo equity plan governing such awards. The Fund will retain all liabilities and obligations with respect to all Yahoo RSU awards held by non-employee directors and individuals who are employees of the Fund as of immediately following the closing.

Under the terms of their Yahoo RSU award agreements, each of our executive officers will generally be entitled to full vesting of his or her Yahoo RSU awards (or full vesting of the replacement Verizon RSU awards, as applicable) if he or she experiences a qualifying termination (as described below in Other Arrangements with Executive Officers).

Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, all Yahoo stock options outstanding immediately prior to the closing will, if not already vested, become fully vested and exercisable, effective as of the closing and will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.

The Fund will retain all liabilities and obligations with respect to all Yahoo stock options.

The following table presents the number of shares underlying the Yahoo stock options and Yahoo RSU awards, in each case whether vested or unvested, held by each of our directors and executive officers as of April 3, 2017 (which is the assumed closing date of the Sale Transaction solely for purposes of this disclosure) and includes shares underlying such awards that could become subject to the acceleration cap upon a qualifying termination of employment, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled Equity Award Agreements. The table also presents the estimated value of such equity awards, calculated by multiplying the number of underlying shares by $38.59 (which is the average closing market price of Yahoo common stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the transaction on July 25, 2016), less the applicable exercise price in the case of Yahoo stock options (but not less than zero). Performance-based awards are presented at target.

The amounts presented in the table below do not attempt to forecast the vesting events that will occur, or any grants, dividends, or forfeitures of Yahoo equity awards that may occur, between April 3, 2017 and the closing. Therefore, the actual number and value of Yahoo stock options and Yahoo RSU awards held by directors and executive officers at the closing will differ from the amounts set forth below.

Awards to Members of the Strategic Review Committee

The members of the Strategic Review Committee, Eric K. Brandt, Thomas J. McInerney, and Jeffrey C. Smith, each was granted a cash or equity award for their service on the Strategic Review Committee. Specifically, on August 4, 2016, Mr. McInerney, as committee chair, received a cash award of $100,000 and Mr. Brandt received a cash award of $50,000. Mr. Smith was also granted a $50,000 award, but such amount was granted in the form of Yahoo RSU awards on September 30, 2016, pursuant to a current election by Mr. Smith to receive Yahoo RSU awards in lieu of cash fees.

Change-in-Control Plan. Each of Yahoos executive officers is covered by the Companys Amended and Restated Change in Control Employee Severance Plan for Level I and Level II Employees, as amended (the Change-in-Control Plan), which provides that if the executives employment with Yahoo (or any subsidiary or successor of Yahoo) is terminated without cause or is terminated by the executive for good reason (as these terms are defined in the Change-in-Control Plan), in either case, within one year after a change in control of Yahoo (which would include the closing of the Sale Transaction), the executive will generally be entitled to receive the following severance benefits:

Payment of the severance benefits described above is conditioned upon the executives execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of Yahoo (or any successor, as applicable) and the executives compliance with his or her confidentiality, proprietary information, and assignment of inventions obligations.

The Change-in-Control Plan will continue to cover executive officers of Yahoo Holdings until the first anniversary of the closing. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, Yahoo Holdings will also assume the Change-in-Control Plan (and its various non-U.S. sub-plans), and such assumed plan (and sub-plans) will survive the closing and will apply to employees of Yahoo Holdings and its subsidiaries according to its (and their) terms.

Equity Award Agreements. Each of the award agreements governing outstanding and unvested Yahoo RSU awards and Yahoo stock options held by our executive officers provides that if the executive officers employment is terminated without cause or if the executive officer resigns for good reason, in either case within one year after a change in control of Yahoo (which would include the closing of the Sale Transaction), then the entire unvested portion of the award will vest in full (at target in the case of performance-based awards), except that such acceleration is capped for purposes of the equity awards granted to our executive officers in March 2016 and such acceleration is absent from the March 2017 awards. For the March 2016 time-based awards, such acceleration is capped at the number of shares otherwise scheduled to vest during the 24 months following the employment termination, and for the March 2016 performance-based awards, such acceleration is capped at the target number of shares for the performance year in which the termination occurs and the immediately following performance year, if any.

Severance Agreements. We have entered into letter agreements with certain of our named executive officers, including Ms. Mayer, Mr. Goldman, and Ms. Utzschneider. Each executive officers letter agreement provides him or her with a right to severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination. We refer to this letter agreement (as amended) for each such executive officer as the Severance Agreement.

Pursuant to the Severance Agreement, if the executive officers employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the agreement), the executive officer will be entitled to a severance benefit consisting of:

The Severance Agreement provides that the executive officer will be entitled to the cash severance and health benefit continuation payments provided under either the Severance Agreement or the Change-in-Control Plan (if applicable), whichever is greater.

Notwithstanding the terms of the Change-in-Control Plan, the equity award agreements, and the Severance Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement provides that all Yahoo stock options that are outstanding immediately prior to the closing will, if not already vested, become fully vested and exercisable, effective as of the closing, and will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.

The following table presents the value of the benefits that each of Yahoos named executive officers would receive in connection with the Sale Transaction, assuming that the Sale Transaction were consummated and each executive officer experienced a qualifying termination on April 3, 2017 (which is the assumed closing date of the Sale Transaction solely for purposes of this transaction-related compensation disclosure). On March 1, 2017, Ronald S. Bell resigned as the Companys General Counsel and Secretary and from all other positions with the Company. No payments are being made to Mr. Bell in connection with his resignation or otherwise in connection with the Sale Transaction. The amounts below are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

Prior to the closing, Yahoo will purchase a six-year director and officer (D&O) tail insurance policy covering the current and former directors and officers of Yahoo and the Business Subsidiaries for any pre-closing claims. The D&O tail policy will have terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Yahoos existing D&O insurance policies. Verizon will pay 50 percent (but not more than $5 million) of the premium for the D&O tail policy.

Following the closing, Yahoo Holdings will indemnify, as the primary source of indemnification, the current and former directors and officers of Yahoo Holdings and the other Business Subsidiaries (but not in the capacity of any roles with Yahoo) for pre-closing acts or omissions. Yahoo Holdings will not provide indemnification for acts or omissions relating to the Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities.

The Fund will retain liability for all indemnification obligations with respect to current and former directors and officers of Yahoo and current and former directors and officers of Yahoo Holdings and the other Business Subsidiaries (i) arising from acts and omissions relating to the Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities or (ii) in their respective capacities as directors and/or officers of Yahoo.

On March 10, 2017, Thomas J. McInerney, the Chairman of the Strategic Review Committee, entered into an offer letter with the Company, effective upon the closing of the Sale Transaction, pursuant to which Mr. McInerney will become the Chief Executive Officer of the Fund upon the closing of the Sale Transaction and, in such capacity, will receive compensation from the Fund.

On March 10, 2017, Arthur Chong became the General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, and will continue in that capacity following the closing of the Sale Transaction, pursuant to an offer letter under which he will receive compensation from the Company. See the section of Annex 1 of this proxy statement entitled Management of the FundCompensation of Officers and Directors.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Sale Transaction

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Sale Transaction. This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions, and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, all as in effect as of the date of this document. Such authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements in this proxy statement. This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those relating to income tax (e.g., estate and gift taxes), nor does it address any state, local, or foreign tax considerations or any tax reporting requirements.

The Sale Transaction will not result in any immediate U.S. federal income tax consequences to Yahoo stockholders.

The Sale Transaction will generally be taxable to Yahoo for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and it is expected that Yahoo will recognize income and gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Sale

Transaction. It is anticipated that certain tax attributes of Yahoo and its affiliates will be available to offset a portion of any such income, gain, and taxes otherwise resulting from the Sale Transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The determination of whether and to what extent such tax attributes will be available is highly complex and is based in part upon facts that will not be known until after the completion of the Sale Transaction, including the existence and amount of available losses, deductions, credits, and other tax attributes arising in the taxable year in which the Sale Transaction occurs (and in prior taxable years). It is currently anticipated that the Sale Transaction will give rise to a U.S. federal income tax liability to Yahoo after any such tax attributes are utilized, and Yahoo will generally be responsible for such taxes under the Reorganization Agreement.

For a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations for stockholders of the Fund following the Sale Transaction, see the section in Annex 1 to this proxy statement entitled U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.

The proposed sale of the Business is expected to be accounted for as a sale of net assets. The results of operations will be treated as discontinued operations.

Neither Delaware law nor the Existing Charter provides Yahoo stockholders with appraisal or dissenters rights in connection with the Sale Transaction.

On February 16, 2017, a stockholder derivative action captioned Summer v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California purportedly on behalf of Yahoo against certain of its current and former directors and officers. On February 17, 2017, a substantially identical stockholder derivative action captioned Bowser v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the same defendants. The complaints allege that defendants failed to disclose the Security Incidents discussed under Security Incidents Contingencies in Annex 2 of this proxy statement and caused or allowed Yahoo to issue materially false and misleading statements in its public filings and other public statements. The complaints assert derivative claims, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaints seek unspecified damages, to enjoin defendants from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the transactions contemplated by the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, disgorgement of profits and compensation obtained by the defendants, an award of attorneys fees and costs, and other related injunctive and equitable forms of relief.

On March 7, 2017, a stockholder derivative and class action captioned Spain v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara. On March 16, 2017, a similar stockholder derivative and class action captioned Westgaard v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara. The complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, against certain of Yahoos current and former directors and officers. The complaints allege that defendants failed to prevent and disclose the Security Incidents discussed under Security Incidents Contingencies in Annex 2 of this proxy statement and caused or allowed Yahoo to issue materially false and misleading statements in its public filings and other public statements. The complaints also assert claims of insider trading, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, against certain defendants under California Corporations Code sections 25402 and 25403. The complaints also assert direct claims, purportedly on behalf of all current Yahoo stockholders, against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the disclosures in this proxy statement concerning the negotiation and approval of the Stock Purchase Agreement and against Verizon for aiding and abetting the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The complaints seek class certification, unspecified damages, to enjoin defendants from consummating the transactions contemplated by the

Stock Purchase Agreement, an award of attorneys fees and costs, and other related injunctive and equitable forms of relief.

Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo is required to obtain approval of the Sale Transaction by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting, and such stockholder approval is a condition to the completion of the Sale Transaction. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Starboard Settlement Agreement, Yahoo is required to submit the Sale Proposal to Yahoo stockholders for approval.

Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of the Business

See Annex 2 to this proxy statement, entitled Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of the Business, for the unaudited combined financial statements of the Business.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information has been derived from the historical financial statements of Yahoo, adjusted to give effect to the Sale Transaction. This unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes, the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, and the remaining sections of this proxy statement.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income of Yahoo for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of Yahoo, as of December 31, 2016, give effect to the Sale Transaction, pursuant to operating company accounting principles. We have included unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of the Fund for the same periods, reflecting adjustments in presenting the Funds operations pursuant to investment company accounting principles, in Annex 1 to this proxy statement.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 is based on Yahoos historical audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, which were filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income of Yahoo for the year ended December 31, 2016 assumes that the Sale Transaction was completed as of January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of Yahoo, as of December 31, 2016 assumes that the Sale Transaction was completed as of December 31, 2016, that the Alibaba Shares were valued at the closing price of Alibaba ADS on December 31, 2016, and that the Yahoo Japan Shares were valued at their closing price on December 31, 2016 and converted into dollars based on the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate on such date.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information and pro forma adjustments are based upon information available as of the date of this proxy statement and have been presented solely for informational purposes and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated balance sheet or statement of income that would have been realized had the Sale Transaction occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that the Fund will experience.

The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the

Sale Transaction, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income, are expected to have a continuing impact on the financial results of the Fund following the Sale Transaction. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income do not include realized gains from the Sale Transaction. The adjustments presented are based on currently available information and reflect certain estimates and assumptions. Therefore, actual results may differ from the pro forma adjustments.

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information of Yahoo

Our named executive officers are the named executive officers listed in the summary compensation table of our most recent annual meeting proxy statement which was filed with the SEC on May 23, 2016: Marissa A. Mayer (our Chief Executive Officer and President), Ken Goldman (our Chief Financial Officer), David Filo (our and Chief Yahoo), Lisa Utzschneider (our Chief Revenue Officer), and Ronald S. Bell (then our General Counsel and Secretary).

We are seeking our stockholders approval of the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Sale Transaction, which is disclosed in the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Sale TransactionGolden Parachute Compensation, including the accompanying footnotes.

In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of Yahoos overall compensation program for our named executive officers and generally have been previously disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation and Leadership Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee) and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms. Each member of the Compensation Committee is an independent director within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards and is a non-employee director under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:

RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Yahoo! Inc. approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to Yahoo! Inc.s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Sale Transaction as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section of this proxy statement captioned Proposal 1The Sale TransactionInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Sale TransactionGolden Parachute Compensation, including the accompanying footnotes.

Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Sale Transaction, and, as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Yahoo, the Board, or the Compensation Committee or on Verizon, its board of directors, or its compensation committee. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Sale Transaction is completed our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the Sale Transaction in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

The Board recommends that you vote FOR the Compensation Proposal.

The Adjournment Proposal will authorize the Board to postpone or adjourn the special meeting (i) for up to 10 business days to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of the Sale Proposal, if the Board determines in good faith such postponement or adjournment is necessary or advisable to obtain stockholder approval, or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders prior to the special meeting.

If, at the special meeting, the Board determines it is necessary or appropriate to adjourn the special meeting, we intend to move to vote on the Adjournment Proposal. For example, the Board may make such a determination if the number of shares of our common stock represented and voting in favor of the Sale Proposal at the special meeting is insufficient to adopt the Sale Proposal, in order to enable the Board to solicit additional proxies in respect of the Sale Proposal. If the Board determines that it is necessary or appropriate, we will ask our stockholders to vote only upon the Adjournment Proposal and not the Sale Proposal or the Compensation Proposal.

In this proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Board to vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. If our stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously voted. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Sale Proposal to defeat that proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the Sale Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of the Sale Proposal. Additionally we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the special meeting (in all cases, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement).

Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

The Board recommends that you vote FOR the Adjournment Proposal.

The following table presents the number of shares of our common stock that were beneficially owned as of April 3, 2017 (except where another date is noted) by (1) known beneficial owners of five percent or more of our common stock, (2) each current director, (3) each named executive officer, and (4) all current directors and current executive officers of the Company as a group.

In Yahoos filings with the SEC, information is sometimes incorporated by reference. This means that we refer you to information previously filed with the SEC that should be considered as part of the particular filing. This proxy statement includes several website addresses. These website addresses are intended to provide inactive, textual references only. The information on those websites is not part of this proxy statement. Documents incorporated by reference will be made available to you, at no cost, upon your oral or written request to us. We incorporate by reference the documents listed below and any future filings we make with the SEC under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than any report or portion thereof furnished or deemed furnished under any Current Report on Form 8-K) prior to the date on which the special meeting is held:

The Board has not received valid notice of any other business that will be presented at the special meeting. It is important that proxies be returned promptly to ensure that shares are represented at the special meeting. You are urged to submit your proxy card or voting instructions as soon as possible electronically over the Internet, by telephone or, if you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, by marking, signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-prepaid envelope provided with your proxy materials.

Stockholders who wished to nominate persons for election to the Board at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and have those director nominees included in the proxy materials distributed by us for such meeting, must have delivered written notice of the nomination to the Corporate Secretary at the above address no earlier than December 28, 2016 and no later than January 27, 2017.

The stockholders written notice must have included certain information concerning the stockholder and each nominee and proposal, as specified in Section 2.5 (with respect to director nominations) and Section 2.6 (with respect to stockholder proposals) of the Companys bylaws, and must have complied with the other requirements specified in such sections of the Companys bylaws.

Description of the Fund Following the Sale Transaction

This Annex 1 describes how Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo or the Company) will operate as a registered investment company regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) following the completion of the Sale Transaction (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled SummaryThe Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction Overview). When the Sale Transaction is completed, Yahoo will change its name to Altaba Inc. We generally refer to Altaba Inc. as the Fund in this Annex 1 to highlight that, after the completion of the Sale Transaction, it will operate as an investment company under the 1940 Act and it will no longer be an operating company. You should read and retain this Annex 1 to understand how your investment in Yahoo will change if the Sale Transaction is completed, to understand the investment objectives and strategies and operational plans that the Fund currently intends to implement following the Sale Transaction and to understand the risks that will be associated with owning common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Fund.

Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, Yahoo will change its name to Altaba Inc. and be an independent, publicly traded, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. The Funds common stock will continue to be listed on NASDAQ Global Select Market (Nasdaq) but its ticker symbol will be changed to AABA.

Assuming the Sale Transaction had closed on December 31, 2016, the Funds investment assets immediately after the Sale Transaction would have consisted of:

We refer to the Funds assets held immediately after the completion of the Sale Transaction as its Initial Assets. For additional information about the Funds Initial Assets, please refer to the section of this Annex 1 entitled Pro Forma Schedule of Investments.

Although Yahoo has no current intention of selling, prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction, a material amount of equity investments that are not included in the Sale Transaction, Yahoo reserves the right to sell any such assets prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction or to sell a material amount of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio to fund repurchases of its common stock or outstanding debt securities. There is no assurance that the Funds Initial Assets will consist of all of the assets described above. There is also no assurance as to the value of the consideration Yahoo might receive in the event of any such disposition. Additionally, Yahoo and the Board reserve the right to distribute any of its cash to investors prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction through repurchases of its common stock or outstanding debt securities or distributions.

As of December 31, 2016, Yahoos 383,565,416 Alibaba Shares represented an approximate 15 percent equity interest in Alibaba and its 2,025,923,000 Yahoo Japan Shares represented an approximate 36 percent

equity interest in Yahoo Japan. Because the Funds assets are expected to consist primarily of its Alibaba Shares and its Yahoo Japan Shares immediately after the Sale Transaction is completed, an investment in the Fund may be particularly subject to risks relating to Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. See the section of this Annex 1 entitled Risk Factors.

The Fund will continue to hold 290,938,700 of its Alibaba Shares through Altaba Holdings Hong Kong Limited (Altaba HK), a Hong Kong private company limited by shares and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund that engages in no other business or operations, and owns no other assets other than de minimis cash. The balance of the Alibaba Shares will continue to be held directly by the Fund.

A diagram depicting the Fund and its holdings immediately following the Sale Transaction is set forth below:

The purpose of the table and the example below is to help you understand the fees and expenses that you, as a holder of the Funds common stock, would bear directly or indirectly on an annual basis after the Sale Transaction. The expenses shown in the table are based on estimated amounts for the Funds first year of operations as an investment company and assume that the Fund has approximate net assets attributable to the Funds common stock of $37 billion during its first full year of operations after registering as an investment company. The Funds actual expenses may vary from the estimated expenses shown in the table.

As required by relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) regulations, the following example illustrates the expenses that you would pay on a $1,000 investment in the Funds common stock, assuming (1) Total Annual Expenses of 2.22 percent of net assets attributable to the Funds common stock and (2) a five percent annual return:*

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE FUND REFLECTING INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations of the Fund for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of the Fund, as of December 31, 2016, reflect adjustments to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Yahoo set forth in the section of the proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionFinancial InformationUnaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information to present the Funds operations pursuant to investment company accounting principles.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations of the Fund for the year ended December 31, 2016 assume that the Sale Transaction was completed as of January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of the Fund, as of December 31, 2016, assumes that the Sale Transaction was completed as of December 31, 2016, that the Alibaba Shares were valued at the closing price on the NYSE of Alibaba ADS on December 31, 2016, that the Yahoo Japan Shares were valued at their closing price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on December 31, 2016 and converted into dollars based on the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate on such date, that the other assets of the Fund historically reported at fair value were valued at fair value, that all of the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 (the Convertible Notes) outstanding on December 31, 2016 remain outstanding after the Sale Transaction is completed, and that for the assets historically reported at cost (other than the Excalibur IP Assets), the fair value has not been determined for the purposes of this unaudited pro forma financial information due to their immateriality both individually and in total.

The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the Sale Transaction, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the Fund. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations do not include realized gains from the Sale Transaction. The adjustments presented are based on currently available information and reflect certain estimates and assumptions. Therefore, actual results may differ from the pro forma adjustments.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information and pro forma adjustments are based upon information available as of the date of this proxy statement and have been presented solely for informational purposes and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities or statements of operations that would have been realized had the Sale Transaction occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that the Fund will experience.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies that will be followed by the Fund. These policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The Fund will follow the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification Topic 946 Financial ServicesInvesting Companies.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

Immediately after completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will not be eligible to be treated as a regulated investment company under the Code as a result of the Funds concentrated ownership of Alibaba Shares. Instead, the Fund will be treated as a regular corporation, or a C corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as a result, unlike most investment companies, will be subject to corporate income tax to the extent the Fund recognizes taxable income and taxable gains. The Fund will recognize tax expense on its taxable income and taxable gains on investments.

Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Significant judgment will be required in evaluating the Funds uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Fund establishes liabilities for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities are established when the Fund believes that certain positions might be challenged despite its belief that its tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

The retained earnings of Yahoos historical operating company recorded in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of assets and liabilities represent the accumulated undistributed earnings prior to investment company status. The Fund currently intends to return substantially all of its cash to stockholders over time through stock repurchases and distributions, although the Fund will retain sufficient cash to satisfy its obligations to creditors and for working capital. The timing and method of any return of capital will be determined by the Board. Stock repurchases may take place in the open market, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans or in a tender offer, or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured and derivative transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions. The Fund currently anticipates that the amount of cash to be retained by the Fund will be at least $1.4 billion, which is the minimum amount necessary to satisfy the Funds obligations under the Convertible Notes. However, the Funds obligations to creditors and working capital requirements may vary over time and may be materially greater than such amount, depending upon, among other factors, the cost of cash-settling any conversion obligations under the Convertible Notes, the Funds potential obligations with respect to the other Retained Liabilities as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled The Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Reorganization AgreementRetained Liabilities, and whether the income from the Funds investments is sufficient to cover its expenses.

The Board will adopt methods for valuing securities and other derivative instruments, including in circumstances in which market quotes are not readily available, and will generally delegate authority to management of the Fund to apply those methods in making fair value determinations, subject to Board oversight. Fund management will administer, implement, and oversee the fair valuation process, and will make fair value decisions. Fund management will review changes in fair value measurements from period to period and may, as deemed appropriate, obtain approval from the Board to changes the fair valuation guidelines to better reflect the results of comparisons of fair value determinations with actual trade prices and address new or evolving issues. The Board and Audit Committee will periodically review reports that describe fair value determinations and methods.

The Fund will categorize the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels as shown below:

Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.

Level 2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, yield curves, default rates, and similar data.

Level 3Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing managements own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best information available.

The availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the security. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3.

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Fund intends to recognize transfers between level 1, level 2, and level 3 as of the beginning of the fiscal year.

A description of the valuation techniques anticipated to be applied to the Funds major categories of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows.

Foreign-denominated assets, including investment securities, will be translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates at period end. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and dividends received and expenses denominated in foreign currencies will be translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. The Fund may hedge against Yen currency risk in connection with dividends received or expected to be received from Yahoo Japan, which are denominated in Yen.

The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on investments will be included with the net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities. Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain (loss) will be disclosed separately.

The Convertible Notes will be carried at their original issuance value, net of unamortized debt discount, and will not be marked to market each period. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $1.3 billion. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was determined on the basis of quoted market prices observable in the market.

The Fund will record security transactions based on the trade date. Dividend income will be recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income will be recognized on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on securities purchased will be accreted and amortized over the lives of the respective securities. Withholding taxes on foreign dividends will be provided for in accordance with the Funds understanding of the applicable countrys tax rules and rates. Realized gains and losses from security transactions will be based on the identified costs of the securities involved.

Approximately 24 percent of the Funds Alibaba Shares are held directly by the Fund and approximately 76 percent are held indirectly through Altaba HK, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund that engages in no other business or operations, and owns no other assets other than de minimis cash. The Fund will consolidate Altaba HK.

Fund expenses will be accrued in the period to which they relate based on estimates performed by management and adjustments are made when actual amounts are known.

The following unaudited pro forma schedule of investments of the Fund assumes that the Sale Transaction was completed as of December 31, 2016, that the Alibaba Shares were valued at the closing price of Alibaba ADS on the NYSE on December 31, 2016, that the Yahoo Japan Shares were valued at their closing price on December 31, 2016 and converted into dollars based on the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate on such date, that the assets of the Fund historically recorded at fair value were valued at fair value, that all of Yahoos Convertible Notes outstanding on December 31, 2016 remain outstanding after the Sale Transaction is completed, and that for the assets historically recorded at cost, the fair value has not been determined for the purpose of this pro forma schedule of investments due to their immateriality both individually and in total.

At December 31, 2016, the tax basis cost of the Funds investments was $8,344,944 and the unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $41,107,070 and ($5,557) respectively, with a net unrealized appreciation of $41,101,512.

The Fund currently intends to seek to track the combined investment return of the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares it owns after the Sale Transaction is completed.

In addition to the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares, after the Sale Transaction is completed the Fund also will own the Minority Investments, Excalibur (which owns the Excalibur IP Assets), the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, and any other Excluded Assets (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Reorganization AgreementExcluded Assets). The Fund currently intends to seek to sell the Minority Investments over time. The Fund also currently intends to seek to sell Excalibur, though the Fund may seek to separately sell certain of the Excalibur IP Assets or to license the Excalibur IP Assets if the Board of Directors of the Fund (the Board) believes that doing so is in the best interest of the Funds stockholders. The Fund currently intends to return substantially all of its cash to stockholders over time through stock repurchases and distributions, although the Fund will retain sufficient cash to satisfy its obligations to creditors and for working capital. The timing and method of any return of capital will be determined by the Board. Stock repurchases may take place in the open market, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans or in a tender offer, or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured and derivative transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions. The Fund currently anticipates that the amount of cash to be retained by the Fund will be at least $1.4 billion, which is the minimum amount necessary to satisfy the Funds obligations under the Convertible Notes. However, the Funds obligations to creditors and working capital requirements may vary over time and may be materially greater than such amount, depending upon, among other factors, the cost of cash-settling any conversion obligations under the Convertible Notes, the Funds potential obligations with respect to other Retained Liabilities, and whether the income from the Funds investments is sufficient to cover its expenses. Until the Minority Investments, Excalibur (or the Excalibur IP Assets), the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, and any other Excluded Assets are sold and until any cash is returned to investors, these assets may cause the Funds returns to deviate from its current investment policy of tracking the combined investment return of the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares. No assurance can be given that all or any portion of the Minority Investments or the Excalibur IP Assets will be sold or licensed or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund may hold all or any portion of its assets, including cash, for an indefinite period of time.

The Funds investment objective is not fundamental and may be changed without notice to stockholders.

Consistent with its current investment objective, the Fund currently does not intend to sell its Alibaba Shares or Yahoo Japan Shares in response to changes in the market price of those shares, though it reserves the right to do so. The Fund may, however, sell all or a portion of such shares to return capital to its stockholders or to seek to reduce any discount or increase any premium from net asset value at which the Funds common stock may trade if the Board believes the benefit to stockholders would outweigh the cost, including any taxes payable by the Fund, of doing so. The Fund also may sell such shares to satisfy its obligations to creditors or to pay expenses. The Board currently believes that it is more likely that capital may be returned from a sale of Yahoo Japan Shares than Alibaba Shares, though no assurance can be given in this regard or that any such shares will be sold to return capital. The Fund does not currently anticipate making new investments other than the purchase of short term investment grade debt securities for ordinary course cash management purposes or to protect or enhance the value of an Initial Asset.

The Fund expects to hire one or more external investment advisers to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. The Fund also expects to establish investment guidelines for the management of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, which may be expressed either as a statement of Fund policy or as

contractual guidelines included in the investment advisory agreement or agreements with such external investment adviser or advisers. The Fund expects these guidelines to be similar to Yahoos existing Corporate Investment Policy. The following is a description of representative investment guidelines the Fund expects to govern the management of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. The following guidelines are expected to apply to each external investment adviser hired by the Fund, individually, without reference to the portion of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio managed by the other.

The Funds objectives in managing the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio are preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and achieving optimum yields in relation to the applicable guidelines. The Fund expects to prohibit the investing or trading of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio for short-term speculative purposes. The Fund expects that it will not permit the weighted average effective duration of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio to exceed 2 years.

Permitted investments are expected to include U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agency securities (excluding mortgage-backed securities), repurchase agreements with maturities not in excess of seven days collateralized by U.S. government securities and permitted U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, debt securities of corporations and commercial banks, non-U.S. sovereign debt rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch (denominated in U.S. dollars and traded in the U.S.), direct obligations of supranational organizations rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch (denominated in U.S. dollars and traded in the U.S.), foreign agency securities guaranteed by foreign governments rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch (denominated in U.S. dollars and traded in the U.S.), tax exempt securities and money market funds. Ineligible investments are expected to include mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, auction rate securities, variable rate demand obligations, extendable debt securities, subordinated corporate debt securities, taxable securities with maturities in excess of 3 years + 2 weeks, tax-exempt securities with maturities in excess of 2 years +2 weeks, securities with short-term ratings below P-1/A-1/F-1 by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch, securities with maturities less than or equal to 2 years with ratings below A3/A- by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch, securities with maturities greater than 2 years and less than 3 years with ratings below A2/A by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch and investments in non-U.S. sovereign debt, direct obligations of supranational organizations and foreign agency securities guaranteed by foreign governments in each case rated below Aaa/AAA by Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch or which are not denominated in U.S. dollars or not traded in the U.S.

The Fund expects that it will require all debt securities to be rated by at least two of Moodys, S&P and Fitch, and that split rated securities will be deemed to have the lower rating. The Fund expects that ratings will be monitored on a continuous basis and that any external investment advisers hired by the Fund to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio will be required to notify the Fund in the event of any downgrades. With respect to tax-exempt securities, the Fund expects to apply the minimum ratings requirements described in the forgoing to the underlying assets of the municipal security and to disregard any ratings enhancement obtained through insurance provided by monoline insurance companies. Additionally, the Fund expects to require that any investment included in the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio be denominated in U.S. dollars and any corporate debt have a minimum issue size of $200 million. The Fund also expects to adopt various concentration limits for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

Consistent with the Funds current investment policies, the Fund currently does not intend to hedge its risk of owning the Alibaba Shares and Yahoo Japan Shares or otherwise enter into derivative transactions. Notwithstanding this current intention, the Fund reserves the right to hedge such risk generally and specifically in connection with transactions relating to the Alibaba Shares or Yahoo Japan Shares, in connection with dividends received or expected to be received from Yahoo Japan denominated in Yen, or in connection with repurchases of the Funds common stock to return capital to investors.

The Fund may lend its Alibaba Shares, Yahoo Japan Shares, or other eligible portfolio securities (collectively, the Eligible Portfolio Securities) to generate income. Such income may be used for working capital purposes, to pay dividends to stockholders, or to repurchase the Funds common stock if and to the extent authorized by the Board from time to time. The Fund has no current intention of lending its Eligible Portfolio Securities to generate income to be used to purchase additional investment securities, though it retains the right to do so. Lending Eligible Portfolio Securities may cause the Funds returns to deviate from its investment objective of tracking the combined investment return of the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares.

Consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, the Fund may lend Eligible Portfolio Securities to broker-dealers or financial institutions; provided that such loans are callable at any time by the Fund (subject to notice provisions described below), and are at all times secured by cash or cash equivalents, which are earmarked or segregated pursuant to applicable regulations, and that are at least equal to the market value, determined daily, of the loaned Eligible Portfolio Securities. Any loans of the Eligible Portfolio Securities by the Fund will be collateralized in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and no loan will cause the value of all loaned Eligible Portfolio Securities to exceed one-third of the value of the Funds total assets.

A loan of Eligible Portfolio Securities generally may be terminated by the borrower on one business days notice, or by the Fund on five business days notice. If the borrower fails to deliver the loaned Eligible Portfolio Securities within five days after receipt of notice, the Fund could use the collateral to purchase replacement Eligible Portfolio Securities while holding the borrower liable for any excess of replacement cost over collateral. As with any extensions of credit, there are risks of delay in recovery, and in some cases even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the Eligible Portfolio Securities fail financially. However, loans of Eligible Portfolio Securities will be made only to firms deemed by the Funds management to be creditworthy and when the income that can be earned from such loans justifies the attendant risks. The Board will oversee the creditworthiness of the contracting parties on an ongoing basis.

Upon termination of the loan, the borrower is required to return the Eligible Portfolio Securities to the Fund. Any gain or loss in the market price during the loan period would inure to the Fund. If the counterparty to the loan petitions for bankruptcy or becomes subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the law regarding the rights of the Fund is unsettled. As a result, under extreme circumstances, there may be a restriction on the Funds ability to sell the collateral, and the Fund would suffer a loss. When voting or consent rights that accompany loaned Eligible Portfolio Securities pass to the borrower, the Fund will follow the policy of calling the loaned securities, to be delivered within one day after notice, to permit the exercise of such rights if the matters involved would have a material effect on the Funds investment in the Eligible Portfolio Securities. The Fund will pay reasonable finders, administrative, and custodial fees in connection with a loan of its Eligible Portfolio Securities.

The Funds Alibaba Shares are currently in the form of ordinary shares. Alibaba ordinary shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE or any other national securities exchange. In order to lend Alibaba Shares to investors, the Fund must first deposit the ordinary shares with the Depositary (as defined in the section of this Annex 1 entitled Description of Initial Assets  Alibaba) in exchange for Alibaba ADS and then lend the Alibaba ADS. The Fund would incur expenses in connection with exchanging its Alibaba ordinary shares for Alibaba ADS which would reduce the gross income earned from lending the Alibaba ADS.

Shares of closed-end management investment companies like the Fund frequently trade at a discount from net asset value. The Board may seek to reduce any such discount or increase any premium to net asset value at which the Funds common stock may trade through repurchases of the Funds common stock in the open market, through tender offers or through any other means available to the Fund. The determination of whether to repurchase shares of the Fund or to engage in any other actions to seek to reduce a discount or increase a

premium will be in the sole discretion of the Board and there can be no assurance that the Fund will repurchase its shares or take any other actions to seek to reduce any discount or increase a premium at which its shares may trade.

The Funds investment in the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares will cause it to be a non-diversified investment company. As a result, there is no limit on the proportion of the Funds assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer and, immediately after completion of the Sale Transaction, the Funds assets will be primarily invested in Alibaba Shares and Yahoo Japan Shares. To the extent that the Funds investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan remain a large portion of its assets, the Funds returns may fluctuate as a result of any single economic, political, or regulatory occurrence affecting, or in the markets assessment of, Alibaba or Yahoo Japan to a greater extent than would be the case for a diversified investment company.

The Funds investment in the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares will cause it to concentrate its investments in securities issued by companies in the online services and e-commerce industry. The 1940 Act requires the Fund to obtain stockholder approval to invest less than 25 percent of its total assets in companies in the online services and e-commerce industry. The Fund has no current intention of investing less than 25 percent of its total assets in companies in the online services and e-commerce industry.

Immediately after completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will not be eligible to be treated as a regulated investment company under the Code, as a result of the Funds concentrated ownership of Alibaba Shares. Instead, upon completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will be treated as a regular corporation, or a C corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, unlike most registered investment companies, will be subject to corporate income tax to the extent the Fund recognizes taxable income. As a result, the Fund will take into account the tax consequences of any change to its investment portfolio. The Fund will record a deferred tax liability based on an assumed effective combined federal and state corporate tax rate on capital gains which will impact the net asset value of the Funds common stock. See the section of this Annex 1 entitled  Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities of the Fund. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions by the Fund of cash or property in respect of the Funds common stock will generally be taxable to stockholders that are U.S. holders (as defined in the section of this Annex 1 entitled U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations).

Changes to Current Investment Objective and Policies

The Funds current investment objective and policies described above were adopted based on current statutes, regulations, and policies applicable to United States financial markets and institutions, corporation taxation, and international trade. The Fund cannot predict which statutes, regulations, or policies will be changed or repealed under the administration of President Donald Trump or, if changes are made, their effect on the value of the Funds assets. Because the Funds investment objective and policies stated above are not fundamental, the Fund retains the right to change them in response to any such changes or for any other reason if the Board of Directors determines such changes to be in the best interests of stockholders. Examples of potential changes to the Funds investment objective and policies include: retaining assets that otherwise would have been sold; selling assets that otherwise would have been retained; selling assets on an accelerated or delayed time frame; diversifying the Funds assets to seek to minimize losses, to enhance gains or to seek to become a regulated investment company under the Code; and changing the way the Fund uses derivatives.

The Funds investment policies and risks as described in this Annex 1 reflect the aggregate operations of the Fund, Altaba HK, and Excalibur. The Fund will comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act governing

investment policies, capital structure, and borrowings on an aggregate basis with Altaba HK and Excalibur. Altaba HK and Excalibur will comply with the provisions of Section 17 of the 1940 Act relating to affiliated transactions. The Fund and Altaba HK will comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act relating to the custody of a registered investment companys assets.

Alibaba is an online and mobile commerce company. Alibabas businesses are comprised of core commerce, cloud computing, mobile media and entertainment, and other innovation initiatives. Alibabas core commerce business is comprised of marketplaces operating in three areas: retail commerce in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC); wholesale commerce in the PRC; and international and cross-border commerce.

Alibaba operates Alibaba Cloud Computing, which Alibaba reported was the PRCs largest provider of public cloud services in 2015 by revenue. Alibaba also reported that Alibaba Cloud Computing had over 2.3 million customers, as of March 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Alibaba also reported that Alibaba Cloud Computing had 765,000 paying customers.

Alibaba has also developed an emerging business in mobile media and entertainment through three distribution platforms, UCWeb mobile media, game publishing and multi-screen entertainment, and content creation and production companies in film, music, and sports.

Alibabas other innovation initiatives include YunOS Operating System, a cloud-based mobile operating system for smartphones and other devices, AutoNavi, a provider of digital map, navigation and location-based services in the PRC, DingTalk, its proprietary enterprise communications app, and Alibaba Health, its vehicle to bring innovative solutions to the healthcare industry.

Alibaba provides fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help merchants, brands, and other businesses that provide products, services, and digital content to leverage the power of the Internet to engage with their users and customers.

The foregoing description of Alibabas business was derived from Alibabas annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, (the Alibaba 2016 Annual Report), which is filed with the SEC and available on the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746916013400/a2228766z20-f.htm and certain figures were updated according to Alibabas quarterly report for the quarter ended December 31,

2016, (the Alibaba December 2016 Quarterly Report), which is filed with the SEC and available on the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000110465917003802/a17-3083_1ex99d1.htm. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Alibaba 2016 Annual Report and the Alibaba December 2016 Quarterly Report.

In September 2014, Alibaba completed an initial public offering of the Alibaba ADS. As a public company, Alibaba files reports with the SEC containing financial and other material information about its business and risks relating to its business. This information may be obtained at the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001577552&owner=exclude&count=40. You should review information filed by Alibaba with the SEC because the value of the Funds common stock will be heavily dependent upon and influenced by the value of Alibaba Shares. All information with respect to Alibaba in this proxy statement is derived from Alibabas public filings with the SEC. Such information is provided for informational purposes only and Yahoo makes no representation and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information.

The Alibaba ADS are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BABA. On December 30, 2016, the closing price of the Alibaba ADS on the NYSE was $87.81 per share. Each Alibaba ADS represents one Alibaba Share. Citibank N.A., as the depositary for the Alibaba ADS, is the holder of the Alibaba Shares underlying the Alibaba ADS. Alibaba ADS holders have rights granted to them in the deposit agreement among Alibaba, the depositary, and holders and beneficial owners of Alibaba ADS from time to time. The Funds Alibaba Shares are currently in the form of ordinary shares. Alibaba ordinary shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE or any other national securities exchange. Accordingly, in order to sell Alibaba Shares through the NYSE or to lend them to investors, the Fund must first deposit the ordinary shares with Citibank, N.A. Hong Kong branch, as custodian for Citibank, N.A. (the Depositary), in exchange for Alibaba ADS. The Fund may then sell or lend the Alibaba ADS in open market transactions without registration in reliance on Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act). The Fund would incur expenses in connection with exchanging its Alibaba ordinary shares for Alibaba ADS which would reduce the Funds total return from a sale of the Alibaba ADS on the NYSE.

Yahoo Japan provides a wide range of online services to Internet users in Japan, from search and information listing to community and e-commerce.

Yahoo Japan was formed as a joint venture between Yahoo and SoftBank Group Corp. (SoftBank) in 1996. As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo and SoftBank (including its subsidiaries) owned approximately 36 percent and 43 percent, respectively, of outstanding Yahoo Japan Shares. In addition, pursuant to the joint venture agreement between Yahoo and SoftBank, each of Yahoo and SoftBank has the right to appoint two representatives to the Board of Directors of Yahoo Japan as long as such party continues to hold at least five percent of Yahoo Japans issued and outstanding shares, although currently five of Yahoo Japans directors are officers or directors of SoftBank.

Yahoo Japans business operations are categorized into the following three segments: (1) Marketing Solutions Business, (2) Consumer Business, and (3) Other Business.

The foregoing description of Yahoo Japans business was derived from information available on Yahoo Japans English language website (the Yahoo Japan Website) at http://ir.yahoo.co.jp/en/. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the information on the Yahoo Japan Website.

You are encouraged to review the information set forth on the Yahoo Japan Website for additional information about Yahoo Japans business, management, results of operations, financial condition, and risks. This information may be obtained on the Yahoo Japan Website on the Investor Relations page at http://ir.yahoo.co.jp/en/. You should review the risk factors affecting the businesses and operations of Yahoo Japan available on the Yahoo Japan Website at http://ir.yahoo.co.jp/en/policy/risk.html. You should also review Yahoo Japans English language press releases available on the Yahoo Japan Website on the Press Releases page at http://pr.yahoo.co.jp/en/. You should review information made available by Yahoo Japan because the value of the Funds common stock will be influenced by the value of the Yahoo Japan Shares. All information with respect to Yahoo Japan in this proxy statement is derived from information available on the Yahoo Japan Website.

Yahoo Japan Shares are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. On December 30, 2016 (the last trading day before December 31, 2016), the closing price of the Yahoo Japan Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was ¥449.00 per share, or approximately $3.82 per share based on the closing Yen/USD foreign exchange rate on such date. Yahoo Japan declared a year-end cash dividend of ¥8.86 or approximately $0.0787 (based on the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2016) per Yahoo Japan Share for the fiscal year ended March 2016 and has publicly stated that it intends to maintain its annual per-share dividends at this level until March 2019.

As of December 31, 2016, the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio consisted of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities with a fair value totaling approximately $7.2 billion. The Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio consists chiefly of investments in commercial paper, short-term and long-term corporate debt, certificates of deposit and shares of money market investment vehicles. The Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio also consists, to a lesser degree, of investments in U.S. agency bonds, other U.S. Treasuries and foreign sovereign debt. The corporate debt and commercial paper included in the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio is allocated among a variety of issuers in the financial, industrial and utility sectors, and the certificates of deposits are allocated among a variety of banks. See Pro Forma Schedule of Investments.

The proceeds of the Sale Transaction, which are expected to be approximately $4.5 billion, subject to adjustment (See Proposal 1The Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction Agreements), except for such amounts as may be used to return capital to stockholders or pay expenses, will be added to the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio following the Sale Transaction and invested in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines the Fund adopts for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio (See Investment Objective and PoliciesInvestment Guidelines for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio). The Fund expects to hire one or more external investment advisers to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio upon the completion of the Sale Transaction.

The Excalibur IP Assets consist of a portfolio of patent assets that are not core to Yahoos operating business and that are substantially concentrated in the following categories: Search/Information Retrieval; Online Advertising; Cloud Computing; Network Infrastructures; Communication Technologies; Data Center Cooling; Machine Learning; Mobile; User Interface; and E-Commerce. The Excalibur IP Assets have been identified as not core to Yahoos operating business because they are redundant with similar assets that will remain with Yahoos operating business for defensive protection.

Upon completion of the Sale Transaction, Verizon Communications Inc. will receive, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement between Yahoo and Excalibur, which will be assigned by

Yahoo to Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a newly-formed subsidiary of Yahoo, in connection with the Sale Transaction, for its benefit and that of its current and certain of its future affiliates, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to the Excalibur IP Assets, which are not being transferred to Yahoo Holdings, Inc. with Yahoos operating business.

The Fund will adopt restrictions and policies relating to the investment of its assets and its activities. As required by the 1940 Act, certain of the restrictions are fundamental and may not be changed without the approval of a 1940 Act Majority of the Funds outstanding voting securities, including the approval of a 1940 Act Majority of the Funds outstanding shares of preferred stock, if any, voting as a separate class. A 1940 Act Majority means the lesser of (a) 67 percent or more of the Funds outstanding voting securities present at a stockholders meeting, if the holders of more than 50 percent of the Funds outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy at the meeting, or (b) more than 50 percent of the Funds outstanding voting securities. Under these fundamental investment restrictions, the Fund may not:

The following explanations of the Funds fundamental investment restrictions are not considered to be part of the Funds fundamental investment restrictions, and are subject to change without stockholder approval.

With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the 1940 Act does not define what constitutes concentration in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25 percent or more of an investment companys total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy will be interpreted to permit unlimited investment in pooled investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds that invest primarily in securities of companies operating in the online services and e-commerce industry. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following, if and to the extent the Fund were to invest more than 25 percent of its total assets in any of the following instruments: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; tax exempt securities of state, territory, possession, or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to the Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among

industries. Compliance with any percentage limitations in the Funds investment policies will be determined at the time of investment. The Fund will not be required to purchase or sell securities to comply with such percentage limitations due to changes in the value of its investments.

With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the 1940 Act permits the Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Funds total assets for any purpose, and to borrow up to five percent of the Funds total assets for temporary purposes. The Funds total assets include the amounts being borrowed and retained by the Fund in cash, securities, or other property. To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the 1940 Act requires the Fund to maintain at all times an asset coverage of at least 300 percent of the amount of its borrowings and of at least 200 percent of the liquidation preference of any preferred stock that it issues. Immediately after the Sale Transaction, the Fund will have no shares of preferred stock outstanding, and the Fund has no current intention to issue preferred stock. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of the Funds total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as leveraging. Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage, and thus are subject to the 1940 Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when the Fund engages in borrowings or trading practices, the Fund, instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300 percent, may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Funds exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be interpreted to permit the Fund to engage in borrowing or trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, and to permit the Fund to segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy. Although the Fund reserves the right to borrow money to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and has outstanding Convertible Notes, it currently intends to borrow additional money to fund working capital and pay other expenses of the Fund. The Fund also may borrow to repurchase its common stock and pay dividends to its stockholders if and to the extent authorized by the Board from time to time. The Fund does not currently intend to use the proceeds of any borrowing to purchase additional investment securities, though it retains the right to do so.

With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the 1940 Act does not prohibit the Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause the Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.

With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the 1940 Act does not prohibit the Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit registered investment companies from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending their securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency, futures transactions, and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, if the Fund were ever to use such derivative instruments, would not be considered loans. The Fund currently does not intend to make loans, except that it may lend its Eligible Portfolio Securities to generate income for working capital, to pay dividends to stockholders or to repurchase the Funds common stock if and to the extent authorized by the Board from time to time.

As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo had approximately $1.4 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes outstanding. The Fund will be obligated under any Convertible Notes that are outstanding as of the closing.

Yahoo reserves the right to repurchase the Convertible Notes from time to time, including through tender offers. Yahoo may repurchase Convertible Notes, through tender offers or otherwise, prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction.

If Yahoo does not repurchase all of the Convertible Notes prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction, then the Convertible Notes will remain senior unsecured obligations of the Fund and will rank senior in right of payment to any Fund indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. The Convertible Notes mature on December 1, 2018, unless previously purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Fund may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of the Funds common stock at an initial conversion rate of 18.7161 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $53.43 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, holders will receive cash, shares of the Funds common stock or a combination thereof, at the Funds election.

Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert them at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events in the future, as described in the Indenture, dated as of November 26, 2013 (the Indenture), between Yahoo and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2018, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods. These events include the following: (i) the price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes falls below a certain threshold compared to the price of the Funds common stock multiplied by the applicable conversion rate for a certain period of time; (ii) the Fund issues rights, options, or warrants to all or substantially all of the Funds common stockholders entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Funds common stock at a price that is less than the average price of the Funds common stock over the last 10 consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately prior to the date of the announcement of the issuance; (iii) the Fund elects to distribute to substantially all of the Funds common stockholders the Funds assets, securities, or rights to purchase securities of the Fund, which distribution has a per share value, as determined in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof, exceeding 10 percent of the last reported sale price of the Funds common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of the announcement of the distribution; (iv) the occurrence of certain fundamental transactions or events (each, a Fundamental Change); (v) the Fund is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, or transfer or lease of all or substantially all of its assets pursuant to which the Funds common stock would be converted into cash, securities, or other assets; or (vi) the price of the Funds common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 percent of the conversion price on each trading day. On or after September 1, 2018 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding December 1, 2018, holders may convert the Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.

As of the date of this proxy statement, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Convertible Notes to convert had been met.

If the Fund undergoes a Fundamental Change, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Fund to purchase for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes. The Fundamental Change purchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased.

The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Indenture trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare 100 percent of the principal of and accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, on all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable. Events of default include the following: (i) default in any payment of certain special interest on any Convertible Note and the default continues for a period of 30 days; (ii) default in the payment of principal of any Convertible Note when such payment is due and payable according to the terms of the Indenture; (iii) failure by the Fund to comply with its obligation to convert the Convertible Notes in accordance with the Indenture and such failure continues for a period of five business days; (iv) failure by the Fund to issue notice regarding a Fundamental Change or a specified corporate event in accordance with the Indenture when due; (v) failure by the Fund to comply with its obligations under Article 11 of the Indenture related to consolidations, mergers and sales of assets; (vi) failure by the Fund for 60 days after written notice has been received by the Fund to comply with any of its agreements contained in the Convertible Notes or the Indenture; (vii) under certain circumstances, a default by the Fund or any subsidiary of the Fund with respect to any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for money borrowed in excess of $100,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent); or (viii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Fund or any of its material subsidiaries.

The above description of the Indenture and the Convertible Notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the Form of Note included therein), which was filed as Exhibit 4.2 to Yahoos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

If the Convertible Notes remain outstanding after the closing of the Sale Transaction, then the Fund would continue to be a party to convertible note hedge transactions (Hedge Transactions) with certain option counterparties (the Option Counterparties) to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Funds common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or offset any cash payment the Fund is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes. The Hedge Transactions include call options giving the Fund the right to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, a certain amount of the Funds common stock. Separately, the Fund will also continue to be a party to privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties giving them the right to purchase common stock from the Fund (the Warrant Transactions). The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to the Funds common stock to the extent that the price per share of its common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants. The initial strike price of the warrants was $71.24. Counterparties to the warrants may make adjustments to certain terms of the warrants upon the occurrence of specified events, including the announcement of the Stock Purchase Agreement (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled SummaryThe Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction Overview), if the event results in a material change to the trading price of Yahoos common stock or the value of the warrants. To date, two counterparties have given notices of adjustments reducing their warrant exercise prices. The warrants begin to expire in March 2019.

In connection with establishing their Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates will have purchased shares of the Funds common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to the Funds common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Funds common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Funds common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of Convertible Notes by the Fund on any

fundamental repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Funds common stock or the Convertible Notes.

The above description of the Hedge Transactions and the Warrant Transactions is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the forms of the Call Option Confirmation and the Warrant Confirmation executed by Yahoo and each Option Counterparty on November 20, 2013, which were filed by Yahoo with the SEC on Form 8-K on November 26, 2013.

The Fund may borrow money to repurchase its common stock, to repurchase or repay the Convertible Notes, to repay any other indebtedness incurred by the Fund, to acquire new investments (although it does not currently intend to do so), and for general operating purposes. The Fund may borrow money through the issuance of senior securities representing indebtedness, including through borrowing from financial institutions or the issuance of debt securities, including notes or commercial paper. The amount and type of borrowings by the Fund must be approved by the Board. The Fund may pledge securities as collateral for any money borrowed, including in connection with margin purchases.

Under the 1940 Act, the Fund generally is not permitted to borrow money unless, immediately after borrowing the money, the value of the Funds total assets, less liabilities, other than the principal amount represented by the borrowing, is at least 300 percent of the principal amount of the borrowing. In addition, the Fund is not permitted to declare any cash dividend or other distribution on its common stock unless, at the time of such declaration, the value of the Funds total assets, less liabilities, other than the principal amount of its borrowings, is at least 300 percent of such principal amount after deducting the amount of such dividend or other distribution. Private borrowings from banks are not subject to these 1940 Act limitations on dividends and other distributions. The 1940 Act generally limits the Fund to issuing only one class of debt.

The terms of any borrowing by the Fund may require the Fund to pay a fee to maintain a line of credit, such as a commitment fee, or to maintain minimum average balances with a lender. Any such requirements would increase the cost of such borrowing over the stated interest rate. Such lenders would have the right to receive interest on and repayment of principal of any such borrowings, which right will be senior to those of the Funds common stock. Any such borrowing may contain provisions limiting certain activities of the Fund, including the payment of dividends to holders of its common stock in certain circumstances.

Some types of borrowings may subject the Fund to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage and portfolio composition requirements. It is not anticipated that these covenants will impede the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective in accordance with its investment policies.

The 1940 Act grants holders of debt securities issued by the Fund, under certain circumstances, certain voting rights in the event of default in the payment of interest or repayment of principal related to the borrowing. Failure to maintain certain asset coverage requirements could result in an event of default and entitle the debt holders to elect a majority of the Board. Private borrowings from banks are not subject to these 1940 Act voting requirements.

The Board will have the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, in one or more series. The Board will also have the authority to designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of each such series, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences, and the number of shares constituting any series.

The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of the Fund without further action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock with voting and

conversion rights may also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the Funds common stock. In certain circumstances, an issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the Funds common stock.

Under the 1940 Act, the Fund may not issue preferred stock unless, immediately after such issuance, it has an asset coverage of at least 200 percent of the liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock (i.e., such liquidation value may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the Funds total assets). For these purposes, asset coverage means the ratio of (1) total assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities to (2) the amount of senior securities representing indebtedness plus the involuntary liquidation preference of the preferred stock. Senior security means any bond, note, or similar security evidencing indebtedness and any class of shares having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends. Senior security representing indebtedness means any senior security other than equity shares. The involuntary liquidation preference of the preferred stock is the amount that holders of the Funds preferred stock would be entitled to receive in the event of an involuntary liquidation of the Fund in preference to the Funds common stock.

In addition, under the 1940 Act the Fund would not be permitted to declare any dividend (except a dividend payable in its common stock), or to declare any other distribution on its common stock, or to purchase any common stock, unless its outstanding preferred stock had at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or other distribution, or at the time of any such purchase of its common stock, an asset coverage of at least 200 percent after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price. If the Fund issues any preferred stock, the Fund intends, to the extent possible, to purchase or redeem its preferred stock from time to time to the extent necessary to maintain asset coverage of any outstanding preferred stock of at least 200 percent. Any preferred stock issued by the Fund would have special voting rights and a liquidation preference over the Funds common stock.

If the Fund issues any preferred stock, the holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a class, will be entitled to elect two of the Funds directors for as long as the preferred stock remains outstanding. The remaining directors of the Fund would be elected by holders of the Funds common stock and its preferred stock voting together as a single class. In the unlikely event the Fund failed to pay dividends on any outstanding preferred stocks for two years, holders of the Funds preferred stock would be entitled to elect a majority of the directors of the Fund.

No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. The Fund currently has no plans to issue preferred stock, but it reserves the right to do so to the full extent permitted by the 1940 Act.

The Fund has entered into a lease agreement for an office location in New York, New York and has signed a letter of intent for office space in San Francisco, California. These office locations have lease periods which expire between 2022 and 2024. Set forth below is a summary of gross lease commitments:

On April 22, 2015, a stockholder action captioned Cathy Buch v. David Filo, et al., was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain of its current and former directors. The complaint asserts both derivative claims, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, and class action claims, purportedly on behalf of the plaintiff and all similarly situated stockholders, relating to the termination of, and severance payments made to, the Companys former chief operating officer, Henrique de Castro. The plaintiff claims that certain current and former board members allegedly violated or acquiesced in the violation of the Companys Bylaws when Mr. de Castro was terminated without cause, and breached fiduciary duties by allowing Yahoo to make allegedly false and misleading statements regarding the value of his severance. The plaintiff has also asserted claims against Mr. de Castro. The plaintiff seeks to have the full Board reassess the propriety of terminating Mr. de Castro without cause, potentially leading to disgorgement in favor of the Company of the severance paid to Mr. de Castro, an equitable accounting, monetary damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and an award of attorneys fees and costs. The Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action, which the Court denied in part and granted in part on July 27, 2016. On April 5, 2017, the Court denied the Companys motion for partial judgment on the pleadings.

On January 27, 2016, a stockholder action captioned UCFW Local 1500 Pension Fund v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company, and certain current and former officers and directors of the Company. On April 29, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint asserts derivative claims, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, for violations of the Investment Company Act of 1940, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, violations of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 124, and violations of California Business & Professions Code Section 17200. The amended complaint seeks to rescind Yahoos employment contracts with the individual defendants because those defendants allegedly caused Yahoo to illegally operate as an unregistered investment company. The plaintiff seeks disgorgement in favor of Yahoo, rescission, and an award of attorneys fees and costs. In addition, the amended complaint asserts a direct claim against Yahoo for alleged violation of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 124(1), based on the allegation that Yahoo has illegally operated as an unregistered investment company. Pursuant to this claim, the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief preventing Yahoo from entering into any future contracts, including any contracts to sell its assets. On October 19, 2016, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint, with leave to amend. On November 18, 2016, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint seeking substantially the same relief as it did in the amended complaint. On February 10, 2017, the District Court dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice. On March 10, 2017, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal.

On January 24, 2017, a stockholder action captioned Madrack v. Yahoo! Inc., et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its current officers. On March 21, 2017, a similar stockholder action captioned Talukder v. Yahoo! Inc., et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs in both actions purport to represent a class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the Companys stock between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016. The complaints assert claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaints allege that the Companys public disclosures about its business, operations, and compliance policies were materially misleading in light of the Security Incidents discussed under Security Incidents Contingencies below. The complaints seek class certification, damages, interest, and an award of attorneys fees and costs. On March 27, 2017, a motion was filed to consolidate these actions and appoint a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The court has not yet issued a ruling on the motion.

On February 9, 2017, a stockholder derivative action captioned The LR Trust, et al. v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara. On March 29, 2017, plaintiffs in that action filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and indemnification, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Companys directors and officers. The amended complaint alleges that defendants failed to prevent and disclose the Security Incidents discussed under Security Incidents Contingencies in Annex 2 of this proxy statement and caused or allowed the Company to issue materially false and misleading statements in its public filings and other public statements. The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, to appoint a third party to review the terms of the proposed transaction with Verizon and this proxy statement prior to the closing of the Transaction, disgorgement of profits and compensation obtained by the defendants, an award of attorneys fees and costs, and other equitable relief.

On February 16, 2017, a stockholder derivative action captioned Summer v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California purportedly on behalf of Yahoo against certain of its current and former directors and officers. On February 17, 2017, a substantially identical stockholder derivative action captioned Bowser v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the same defendants. The complaints allege that defendants failed to disclose the Security Incidents discussed under Security Incidents Contingencies in Annex 2 of this proxy statement and caused or allowed Yahoo to issue materially false and misleading statements in its public filings and other public statements. The complaints assert derivative claims, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaints seek unspecified damages, to enjoin defendants from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the transactions contemplated by the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, disgorgement of profits and compensation obtained by the defendants, an award of attorneys fees and costs, and other related injunctive and equitable forms of relief.

On February 20, 2017, a stockholder derivative action captioned Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v. Eric Brandt, et al., was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery purportedly on behalf of the Company and against certain of its current officers and directors. The complaint asserts derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint alleges the defendants violated their fiduciary duties by, among other things, causing or allowing the Company to issue materially false and misleading public statements and failing to disclose the Security Incidents in the Companys public disclosures and in representations and warranties provided to Verizon in connection with the Original Stock Purchase Agreement. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, equitable and injunctive relief, and an award to plaintiff of the costs and disbursements of the action, including but not limited to attorneys fees and expenses.

On March 7, 2017, a stockholder derivative and class action captioned Spain v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara. On March 16, 2017, a similar stockholder derivative and class action captioned Westgaard v. Marissa Mayer, et al., was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara. The complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, against certain of Yahoos current and former directors and officers. The complaints allege

that defendants failed to prevent and disclose the Security Incidents discussed under Security Incidents Contingencies in Annex 2 of this proxy statement and caused or allowed Yahoo to issue materially false and misleading statements in its public filings and other public statements. The complaints also assert claims of insider trading, purportedly on behalf of Yahoo, against certain defendants under California Corporations Code sections 25402 and 25403. The complaints also assert direct claims, purportedly on behalf of all current Yahoo stockholders, against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the disclosures in this proxy statement concerning the negotiation and approval of the Stock Purchase Agreement and against Verizon for aiding and abetting the individual defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The complaints seek class certification, unspecified damages, to enjoin defendants from consummating the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, an award of attorneys fees and costs, and other related injunctive and equitable forms of relief.

The Company may be involved in claims, suits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings, including actions with respect to the Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities, which may include intellectual property claims, privacy, consumer protection, information security, data protection or law enforcement matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, purported class action lawsuits, and other matters.

The Company has determined, based on current knowledge, that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses, including reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts already accrued, is not reasonably estimable with respect to certain matters described above. The Company has also determined, based on current knowledge, that the aggregate amount or range of losses that are estimable with respect to the Companys legal proceedings, including the matters described above, would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts accrued as of December 31, 2016 were not material. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties, and cannot be predicted with certainty. In the event of a determination adverse to Yahoo, its subsidiaries, directors, or officers in these matters, the Company may incur substantial monetary liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company may also incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against these claims.

On September 22, 2016, the Company disclosed that a copy of certain user account information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoos network in late 2014 (the 2014 Security Incident). On December 14, 2016, the Company disclosed that, based on its outside forensic experts analysis of data files provided to the Company in November 2016 by law enforcement, the Company believes an unauthorized third party stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August 2013 (the 2013 Security Incident). In November and December 2016, the Company disclosed that based on an investigation by its outside forensic experts, it believes an unauthorized third party accessed the Companys proprietary code to learn how to forge certain cookies. The outside forensic experts have identified approximately 32 million user accounts for which they believe forged cookies were used or taken in 2015 and 2016 (the Cookie Forging Activity). The 2013 Security Incident, the 2014 Security Incident, and the Cookie Forging Activity are collectively referred to herein as the Security Incidents.

As of April 20, 2017, approximately 43 putative consumer class action lawsuits had been filed against the Company in U.S. federal and state courts, and in foreign courts, relating to the Security Incidents, one of which was voluntarily dismissed. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of users, generally claim to have been harmed by the Companys alleged actions and/or omissions in connection with the Security Incidents and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages or other related relief.

In addition, as described above, two putative stockholder class actions have been filed against Yahoo and certain current officers of Yahoo on behalf of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Companys stock between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016, two additional putative class actions have been filed against certain current and former directors and officers of Yahoo on behalf of current stockholders of Yahoo, and six stockholder derivative actions have been filed purportedly on behalf of Yahoo against its current and former directors and officers, each asserting claims related to the Security Incidents.

Additional lawsuits and claims related to the Security Incidents may be asserted by or on behalf of users, partners, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief.

Following the consummation of the Sale, pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, the Fund will be responsible for 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to the Security Incidents. The Fund will be responsible for 100 percent of any such liabilities that are finally determined and entered or stipulated against the Fund or any of its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Sale, in addition to other Retained Liabilities.

While a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses related to these legal proceedings at this time because the legal proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. Based on current information, the Company does not believe that a loss from these matters is probable and therefore has not recorded an accrual for litigation or other contingencies relating to the Security Incidents. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an accrual for estimated losses at the time or times it is determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.

You should consider the following risk factors associated with investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested.

The market price and net asset value of the Funds common stock will be materially impacted by the market price of Alibaba Shares.

The market price and net asset value of the Funds common stock will be materially impacted by the market price of Alibaba Shares.

Alibaba is an online and mobile commerce company. If the Sale Transaction had closed as of December 31, 2016, the Funds Alibaba Shares would have represented approximately 61.9 percent of the value of the Funds total assets. The Alibaba Shares are anticipated to be a significant portion of the Funds assets after the Sale Transaction. The Fund currently intends to continue to invest a substantial portion of its total assets in the Alibaba Shares. As a result, the market price and net asset value of the Funds common stock will be materially impacted by the market price of Alibaba Shares, which in turn will be affected by Alibabas business, management, results of operations, and financial condition.

The trading price of Alibaba Shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to the Fund. For example, the high and low sale prices of Alibaba ADS between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 were $109.87 and $59.25, respectively.

In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for the Alibaba Shares may be highly volatile for specific business reasons, including: (i) variations in Alibabas results of operations; (ii) announcements about Alibabas earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations; (iii) publication of operating or industry metrics by third parties, including government statistical agencies, that differ from expectations of industry or financial analysts; (iv) changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; (v) announcements made by Alibaba or its competitors of new product and service offerings, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; (vi) press reports, whether or not true, about Alibabas business; (vii) regulatory allegations or actions or negative reports or publicity against Alibaba, regardless of their veracity or materiality to Alibaba; (viii) changes in pricing made by Alibaba or its competitors; (ix) conditions in the online retail market; (x) additions to or departures of Alibaba management; (xi) fluctuations of exchange rates between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar; (xii) release or expiry of any transfer restrictions on outstanding Alibaba Shares; (xiii) sales or perceived potential sales or other disposition of existing or additional Alibaba Shares or other equity or equity-linked securities, including by Alibabas principal shareholders, directors, officers, and other affiliates; (xiv) the creation of vehicles that hold Alibaba Shares; (xv) actual or perceived general economic and business conditions and trends in the PRC and globally; and (xvi) changes or developments in the PRC or global regulatory environment. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of Alibaba Shares.

Alibaba primarily derives its revenue from online marketing services, commissions based on transaction value derived from certain of its marketplaces, fees from the sale of memberships on its wholesale marketplaces, and cloud service fees. Alibabas future revenue growth depends on its ability to expand into new geographic regions and grow its other businesses. Alibaba faces risks associated with expanding into sectors or geographies in which it has limited or no experience. In addition, Alibabas revenue growth may slow or decline for other reasons, including decreasing consumer spending, increasing competition and slowing growth of the PRC retail or PRC online retail industry and changes in government policies or general economic conditions.

Alibaba faces increasingly intense competition, mainly from Chinese and global Internet companies as well as certain offline retailers and e-commerce players, including those that specialize in a limited number of product

categories. In addition, Alibaba faces increasing competition in the diversified mobile commerce industry for mobile users in the PRC from established as well as emerging mobile commerce platforms. If Alibaba is not able to compete effectively, the gross merchandise volume transacted on Alibabas marketplaces and the users and activity levels on its platforms may decrease significantly, which could materially and adversely affect Alibabas business, financial condition, and results of operations as well as its brand. The Internet industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new mobile apps, protocols and technologies, new service and product introductions, new media and entertainment content, and changing customer demands. Furthermore, Alibabas competitors are constantly developing innovations in Internet search, online marketing, communications, social networking, entertainment, and other services, on both mobile devices and personal computers, to enhance users online experience. Alibabas failure to innovate and adapt to these changes would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Alibaba files with the SEC reports containing financial and other material information about its business and risks relating to its business. You are encouraged to review the information set forth in Alibabas registration statements on Form F-1 and Form F-4 and annual reports on Form 20-F for additional information about Alibabas business, management, results of operations, financial condition, and risks. You should also review Alibabas press releases and reports filed with the SEC on Form 6-K. This information may be obtained at the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001577552&owner=exclude&count=40. You should review information filed by Alibaba with the SEC because the value of the Funds common stock will be heavily dependent upon and influenced by the value of the Alibaba Shares. All information with respect to Alibaba in this proxy statement is derived from Alibabas public filings with the SEC. Such information is provided for informational purposes only and Yahoo makes no representation and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information.

The Alibaba Partnership, Alibabas voting agreements with certain of its shareholders, and SoftBanks investment in Alibaba will limit the Funds ability to influence the nomination and election of Alibaba directors.

The Alibaba partnership, comprised of certain management members of Alibaba, Zhejiang Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co., Ltd., and Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co. Ltd. (the Alibaba Partnership), has the ability, under Alibabas articles of association, to nominate a simple majority of Alibabas board of directors. If at any time Alibabas board of directors consists of fewer than a simple majority of directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership for any reason, including because a director previously nominated by the Alibaba Partnership ceases to be a member of Alibabas board of directors or because the Alibaba Partnership had previously not exercised its right to nominate or appoint a simple majority of Alibabas board of directors, the Alibaba Partnership will be entitled (in its sole discretion) to nominate or appoint such number of additional directors to the board as necessary to ensure that the directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership comprise a simple majority of Alibabas board of directors.

Alibaba, Yahoo, and SoftBank entered into a voting agreement pursuant to which SoftBank, Yahoo, Jack Ma, and Joe Tsai agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Alibaba Partnership director nominees at each annual general stockholders meeting, so long as SoftBank owns at least 15 percent of Alibabas outstanding ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2016, SoftBank owned approximately 29.9 percent of the Alibaba Shares based on publicly available filings with the SEC. Furthermore, the voting agreement provides that SoftBank has the right to nominate one director to the board of Alibaba until SoftBank owns less than 15 percent of Alibabas outstanding ordinary shares. In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, Yahoo, Jack Ma, and Joe Tsai have agreed to vote their shares (including shares for which they have voting power) in favor of the election of the SoftBank director nominee at each annual general shareholders meeting in which the SoftBank nominee stands for election. Moreover, subject to certain exceptions, pursuant to the voting agreement SoftBank and Yahoo have agreed to give Jack Ma and Joe Tsai a proxy over, with respect to SoftBank, any portion of its shareholdings exceeding 30 percent of Alibabas outstanding shares and, with respect to Yahoo, all of its shareholdings up to a

maximum of 121.5 million of Alibabas ordinary shares. These proxies will remain in effect until Jack Ma owns less than 1 percent of Alibabas ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis or Alibaba materially breaches the voting agreement. The Fund will remain a party to, and will be subject to all of Yahoos obligations under, the voting agreement after the Sale Transaction.

As a result of the foregoing nomination and voting arrangements, the Funds ability to affect the management of Alibaba through election of directors to Alibabas board of directors will be substantially limited.

The Funds investment performance may be materially and adversely affected by economic conditions in the PRC as well as globally.

A significant portion of the Funds assets will consist of Alibaba Shares. Alibaba has significant operations in the PRC. As a result, the Funds investment performance and net income are impacted to a significant extent by economic, political and legal developments in the PRC.

Chinese equities and many American Depositary Shares issued by companies that primarily operate in the PRC, including Alibaba, have experienced increased volatility since May 2015. Although the PRC government has taken steps to seek to stabilize the PRC equity markets, it is uncertain what effect such measures will have, if any, on the PRC equity markets or on the price of American Depositary Shares issued by companies that primarily operate in the PRC. Continued price drops in the PRC equity markets and any related price drops of American Depositary Shares issued by companies that primarily operate in the PRC may adversely affect the Funds investment performance and the market price of the Funds common stock.

The PRC government has in recent years implemented a number of measures to control the rate of economic growth, including by raising interest rates and adjusting deposit reserve ratios for commercial banks, as well as by implementing other measures designed to tighten credit and liquidity and regulate its securities market. These measures have contributed to a slowdown of the PRC economy. While the PRC government started easing its monetary policy in 2015, there have been signs of a continuing economic slowdown in the PRC. Any continuing or worsening slowdown could significantly reduce domestic commerce in the PRC, including business activities conducted through the Internet generally and within the online services and e-commerce industry in which the Funds investments are concentrated. An economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, a further decrease in economic growth rates, or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in the PRC or any other market could have a material adverse effect on the Funds investment performance and financial condition.

The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange, and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in the PRC is still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over the PRCs economic growth by strategically allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, regulating financial services and institutions, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.

While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past three decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on the Fund. The Funds financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to Alibaba.

If the PRC government deems that Alibabas contractual arrangements in relation to variable interest entities owned by PRC citizens and through which Alibaba conducts its business in the PRC do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, Alibabas business and results of operations may be impacted, which in turn may adversely affect the Funds investment performance.

Foreign ownership of certain types of Internet businesses in the PRC, such as Internet information services, is subject to restrictions under applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations and foreign investors are generally not permitted to own more than 50 percent of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunication service provider. Alibaba provides Internet information services in the PRC through a number of PRC incorporated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are owned by PRC citizens who are Alibabas founders or senior employees or by PRC entities owned by such PRC citizens, and who have contractual arrangements with Alibaba. These contractual arrangements give Alibaba effective control over each of the VIEs enabling it to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from the VIEs and consolidate the financial results of the VIEs in its results of operations. Although the VIE structure adopted by Alibaba is consistent with longstanding industry practice, and is commonly adopted by comparable companies in the PRC, the PRC government may not agree that these arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration, or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies, or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future.

In January 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law (the Discussion Draft), which aims to, upon its enactment, replace the existing laws regulating foreign investment in the PRC. While the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC completed the solicitation of the comments on the Discussion Draft in February 2015, there are still substantial uncertainties with respect to its enactment timetable. The Discussion Draft, if enacted as proposed, may impact the viability of Alibabas current corporate structure, corporate governance, and business operations. There are substantial uncertainties with regard to the interpretation and application of the Discussion Draft, once enacted, and to current PRC laws, rules, and regulations. If Alibaba or any of its VIEs are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules, or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, or fulfill any reporting obligations, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of Alibaba, and in turn, the Funds investment performance.

There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules, and regulations.

Most of Alibabas operations are conducted in the PRC and are governed by the PRC laws, rules, and regulations. Alibabas PRC subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules, and regulations applicable to foreign investment in the PRC. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but, unlike the common law system, they have limited precedential value.

In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules, and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in the PRC. However, the PRC has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws, rules, and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in the PRC, or may be subject to significant degrees of interpretation by PRC regulatory agencies. In particular, because these laws, rules, and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, and because the laws, rules, and regulations often give the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules, and regulations involve uncertainties, and can be inconsistent and unpredictable. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, Alibaba may not be aware of any violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the occurrence of the violation.

Any administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection Alibaba enjoys than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede Alibabas ability to enforce the contracts it has entered into, and could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Funds investments.

The market price and net asset value of the Funds common stock will be materially impacted by the market price of Yahoo Japan Shares and the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate.

The market price and net asset value of the Funds common stock will be materially impacted by the market price of Yahoo Japan Shares. The equity valuation of the Funds investment in Yahoo Japan and the dividends the Fund receives from Yahoo Japan may be impacted due to fluctuations in the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate. The Japanese yen has shown volatility in the past and may also be affected by currency volatility elsewhere in Asia, especially Southeast Asia.

Yahoo Japan provides a wide range of online services to Internet users in Japan, from search and information listing to community and e-commerce. If the Sale Transaction had closed as of December 31, 2016, the Funds Yahoo Japan Shares would have represented approximately 14.2 percent of the value of the Funds total assets based on the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate on such date. The Yahoo Japan Shares are anticipated to be a significant portion of the Funds assets after the Sale Transaction. The Fund currently intends to continue to invest a substantial portion of its total assets in the Yahoo Japan Shares. As a result, the market price and net asset value of the Funds common stock will be materially impacted by the market price of Yahoo Japan Shares, which in turn will be affected by Yahoo Japans business, management, results of operations, and financial condition. You are encouraged to review the risk factors affecting the businesses and operations of Yahoo Japan available on the Yahoo Japan Website at http://ir.yahoo.co.jp/en/policy/risk.html.

The trading price of Yahoo Japan Shares can be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to the Fund. For example, the high and low sale prices of Yahoo Japan Shares between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 were ¥534 and ¥385, respectively. Yahoo Japan Shares are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which means the investment performance of Yahoo Japan Shares are impacted by fluctuations in the Japanese equity market, which has experienced increased volatility and decline since late 2015. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for the Yahoo Japan Shares may be volatile for specific business reasons, including: (i) variations in Yahoo Japans results of operations; (ii) announcements about Yahoo Japans earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations; (iii) publication of operating or industry metrics by third parties, including government statistical agencies, that differ from expectations of industry or financial analysts; (iv) changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; (v) announcements made by Yahoo Japan or its competitors of new product and service offerings, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (vi) press reports, whether or not true, about Yahoo Japans business; (vii) regulatory allegations or actions or negative reports or publicity against Yahoo Japan, regardless of their veracity or materiality to Yahoo Japan; (viii) changes in pricing made by Yahoo Japan or its competitors; (ix) conditions in the online retail market; (x) additions to or departures of Yahoo Japan management; (xi) fluctuations of exchange rates between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar; (xii) actual or perceived general economic and business conditions and trends in Japan and globally; and (xiii) changes or developments in Japan or global regulatory environment. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of Yahoo Japan Shares.

Yahoo Japan generates a significant amount of its revenue from its advertising-related and e-commerce businesses, which may be hindered by such factors as a slow growth in the Internet advertising market, a decrease in advertising expenditures (which could result from macroeconomic trends, changing user behavior or trends in advertising budget allocations), Yahoo Japans failure to obtain a significant share of the mobile

advertising market, or a slowdown in the growth rate of users of member services or fee-based services, each of which could negatively impact Yahoo Japans advertising revenues and business performance.

Yahoo Japan operates in an intensely competitive and technology-based Internet market that is subject to rapid changes, including changes in laws and the regulatory environment and the risk of consumer lawsuits or lawsuits alleging intellectual property infringements. It faces competition from companies that are in the business of mobile operating system development, Internet advertising, and e-commerce. Competitors include companies such as Rakuten, Google and Microsoft. The Internet sector is characterized by fast technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing market conditions, and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of services using new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards can make the existing products or services under development obsolete or unmarketable. In order to compete effectively, the company must continually adapt to a rapidly changing business environment and introduce new products and services that achieve market acceptance. If the companys services become obsolete or it is slow to implement new technologies, then it could suffer a decline in competiveness against its competitors. There can be no assurance that Yahoo Japan can maintain its market position in the Japanese Internet market, and the failure to so maintain its position could have a negative impact on its business performance. Yahoo Japan also relies on Google to provide search engine and advertisement providing services tied to web searches, which agreement expires March 31, 2019. Changes in this relationship, any relationship with any significant shareholder or other business partner, or any business strategies of such shareholders or partners could adversely affect Yahoo Japans businesses and services.

The Funds ability to sell its Yahoo Japan Shares is subject to the joint venture agreement between Yahoo and SoftBank. Under this joint venture agreement, each party is required to give the other party a 20 day prior written notice of its intention to sell Yahoo Japan Shares. In addition, the selling party must provide the non-selling party with a right of first refusal to purchase Yahoo Japan Shares being sold to a third party on the same terms and conditions being offered to the third party. If the non-selling party declines to purchase the selling partys Yahoo Japan Shares, the non-selling party has the right to participate in the sale of the Yahoo Japan Shares by the selling party on a pro rata basis. Without the consent of SoftBank, the Fund may not (i) directly or indirectly sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or pledge or otherwise encumber, any Yahoo Japan shares except for sales in the open market or (ii) purchase additional shares of Yahoo Japan on the open market from any third party. There is no assurance that the Funds obligations under this joint venture agreement or Japanese law will not adversely affect the Funds ability to sell its Yahoo Japan Shares or obtain the market price for its Yahoo Japan Shares.

In addition, under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Fund may not, without Verizons consent, to the extent within Yahoos control, and except as may result in a violation by the Fund or any of its directors, officers, or employees of applicable law (including fiduciary duties) sell its shares in Yahoo Japan or consent to an acquisition of Yahoo Japan or all or substantially all of Yahoo Japans assets if such action would reasonably be expected to cause the termination of, or give Yahoo Japan the right to terminate, the license agreement between Yahoo Japan and the Company.

You are encouraged to review the information set forth on the Yahoo Japan Website for additional information about Yahoo Japans business, management, results of operations, financial condition, and risks. This information may be obtained on the Yahoo Japan Website on the Investor Relations page at http://ir.yahoo.co.jp/en/. You should also review Yahoo Japans English language press releases available on the Yahoo Japan Website on the Press Releases page at http://pr.yahoo.co.jp/en/. You should review information made available by Yahoo Japan because the value of the Funds common stock will be heavily dependent upon and influenced by the value of the Yahoo Japan Shares. All information with respect to Yahoo Japan in this proxy statement is derived from information available on the Yahoo Japan Website. Such information is provided for informational purposes only and Yahoo makes no representation and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information.

The Funds investment performance may be materially and adversely affected by economic conditions in Japan as well as globally.

A significant portion of the Funds assets will consist of Yahoo Japan Shares. Yahoo Japan has significant operations in Japan. As a result, the Funds investment performance and net income are impacted to a significant extent by economic and operating conditions in Japan.

The Japanese economy has only recently emerged from a prolonged economic downturn. Since 2000, Japans economic growth has remained relatively low. Japans economy could be negatively impacted by many factors, including rising interest rates, tax increases, and budget deficits. In the past, at times, the Japanese economy has been negatively affected by government intervention and protectionism, an unstable financial services sector, a heavy reliance on international trade, and natural disasters. The foregoing factors, as well as other political, social, regulatory, economic, or environmental events that occur in Japan, including changes in domestic consumption, increases in government debt, and changes to fiscal, monetary, or trade policies, may affect Japanese markets and adversely affect the Funds investment performance.

Japans international trade has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies, and the economic, political, or social instability of these countries (whether resulting from local or global events). Japans important trade partners include the United States, the PRC, and certain countries in Southeast Asia, and such trade can be affected by conditions in these other countries and currency fluctuations.

Despite a deepening in the economic relationship between Japan and the PRC, the countries political relationship has at times been strained in recent years. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect Japans economy, especially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole.

Japans decline in productivity due to a population decrease, aging society, and stagnant investment due to the population decrease as well as uncertainty regarding reform efforts and their successful implementation could materially and adversely affect the Funds investment performance.

Some of Japans economic reform and trade liberalization measures may benefit the overall economy of Japan, but may also have a negative effect on the Fund. The Funds investment performance could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to Yahoo Japan.

Shareholder rights under Japanese law may be more limited than shareholder rights under the laws of the United States.

Yahoo Japan is regulated by, among other rules and regulations, the Companies Act (Act No. 86 of July 26, 2005) which governs its corporate affairs. Legal principles relating to the operation of Yahoo Japan, including as to matters such as the validity of corporate procedures, directors and officers fiduciary duties, and shareholders rights may be different from those that apply to U.S. companies. Shareholder rights under Japanese law may not be as extensive as shareholders rights under the laws of the United States. In addition, Japanese courts may not be willing to enforce liabilities against Yahoo Japan in actions brought in Japan that are based upon the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state.

The Funds ability to sell or otherwise dispose of the Alibaba Shares, Yahoo Japan Shares, and Minority Investments will be limited by certain factors.

Factors limiting the Funds ability to dispose of its assets include:

As a result, the Fund may not sell or otherwise dispose of Alibaba Shares or Yahoo Japan Shares even in circumstances in which an investor who is not subject to these considerations might determine to sell Alibaba Shares or Yahoo Japan Shares. Accordingly, the Fund may continue to hold Alibaba Shares and Yahoo Japan Shares during periods in which the value of Alibaba Shares or Yahoo Japan Shares, as applicable, declines substantially.

In addition, under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Fund may not, without Verizons consent, to the extent within Yahoos control, and except as may result in a violation by the Fund or any of its directors, officers, or employees of applicable law (including fiduciary duties) sell its shares in Yahoo Japan or consent to an acquisition of Yahoo Japan or all or substantially all of Yahoo Japans assets if such action would reasonably be expected to cause the termination of, or give Yahoo Japan the right to terminate, the license agreement between Yahoo Japan and the Company.

Risks Related to the Funds Operations as an Investment Company

Investments in the Fund may perform poorly and could result in your entire investment being lost.

An investment in the Funds common stock is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. At any point in time, your shares of the Funds common stock may be worth less than your original investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.

An investment in the Funds common stock should not be considered a complete investment program.

An investment in the Funds common stock should not be considered a complete investment program. Each stockholder should take into account the Funds investment objective and policies, as well as the stockholders other investments when considering an investment in the Fund.

The Funds investments in equity securities are volatile.

Stock markets are volatile, and the prices of equity securities, such as the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares, fluctuate based on changes in a companys financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. Although over many historical periods common stocks have generated higher average total returns than fixed income securities, common stocks also have experienced significantly more volatility in those returns and, in certain periods, have significantly under-performed relative to fixed income securities. An adverse event, such as an unfavorable earnings report, may depress the value of such equity securities. Equity securities may also decline due to factors affecting the issuers industry. The value of the equity securities held by the Fund, such as the Alibaba Shares and the Yahoo Japan Shares, may decline for a number of other reasons which directly relate to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage, the issuers historical and prospective earnings, the value of its assets, and reduced demand for its goods and services, or when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur. Also, the prices of common stocks are sensitive to general

movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the price of the issuers shares. Common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons, including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market. Stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries. These fluctuations may include a so-called bubble market in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the e-commerce industry, to unsustainable levels. These market fluctuations may significantly affect the trading price of the Funds investments, including the Funds Alibaba Shares and Yahoo Japan Shares. In addition, common stock prices may be sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of capital rises and issuers borrowing costs increase. Equity securities are structurally subordinated to preferred stock, bonds, and other debt instruments in the issuers capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income, and are therefore inherently more risky than preferred stock or debt instruments of the issuer.

The Funds revenue sources may be limited following the Sale Transaction.

Immediately after the Sale Transaction, the Funds investment assets will be its direct and indirect interests in the Alibaba Shares, the Yahoo Japan Shares, the Minority Investments, the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, and the Excalibur IP Assets. The Funds ability to meet its financial obligations and other contractual commitments depends upon its ability to access cash. The Funds potential sources of cash include:

Prior to the date of this proxy statement, Alibaba has not paid dividends on Alibaba Shares and has stated that it does not currently intend to pay dividends on Alibaba Shares. Yahoo Japan declared a year-end cash dividend of ¥8.86 or approximately $0.0787 (based on the Yen/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2016) per Yahoo Japan Share for the fiscal year ended March 2016 (which resulted in an aggregate dividend of approximately $164,000,000 being paid to Yahoo in 2016) and has publicly stated that it intends to maintain its annual per-share dividends at this level until March 2019. No assurance can be given that Yahoo Japan will maintain its current annual per share cash dividend for any future fiscal years. In 2016, the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio generated $61,000,000 of income for Yahoo. No assurance can be given that the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio will produce as much income for Altaba, particularly if all or a portion of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio is monetized to fund repurchases of Altabas common stock.

The Fund may not be able generate income from other sources. As a result, the Fund could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service its financial obligations or meet its other commitments unless it sells Alibaba Shares, Yahoo Japan Shares, Minority Investments, the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, or Excalibur IP Assets, which would cause the Fund to pay taxes on any capital gain that it realized in connection with the sale.

The Funds use of borrowed money could result in greater volatility and losses.

The Fund anticipates that it may have as much as $1.4 billion of Convertible Notes outstanding immediately after the Sale Transaction. Although the Fund currently has no intent to do so, the Fund may enter into leverage transactions (i) to fund working capital and pay other expenses of the Fund, (ii) to repurchase shares of its

common stock and pay dividends to its stockholders, and (iii) to seek to enhance returns or to diversify its portfolio, in each case if and to the extent authorized by the Board from time to time. As a result, the net asset value and market value of its common stock may be more volatile. Any decline in the net asset value of the Funds investments will be borne entirely by the holders of the Funds common stock. Therefore, if the market value of the Funds portfolio declines, the borrowing will result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of the Funds common stock than if the Fund had not borrowed money. This net asset value decrease may cause a greater decline in the market price of the Funds common stock. In extreme cases, the Fund might be in danger of failing to maintain the 300 percent asset coverage required by the 1940 Act. In such an event, the Fund might liquidate investments in order to repay all or a portion of the money it had borrowed. The Fund would be required to pay taxes on any gains realized in connection with any sale of its assets to repay its borrowings. A sale of Alibaba Shares, Yahoo Japan Shares, Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, Minority Investments or Excalibur IP Assets at times when the value of such assets has declined would be disadvantageous to the Fund.

Lending the Funds securities to third parties may cause losses.

The Fund may lend its Eligible Portfolio Securities to banks or dealers which meet the creditworthiness standards established by the Board from time to time. Securities lending is subject to the risk that loaned securities may not be available to the Fund on a timely basis and the Fund may, therefore, lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price. Any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the Fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the Fund, and would adversely affect the Funds performance. Also, there may be delays in recovery, or no recovery, of securities loaned, or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding.

The financial information regarding the Fund provided in the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionFinancial Information and this Annex 1 may not be representative of the Funds actual future financial position.

Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, Yahoos remaining assets will consist solely of the assets excluded from the Sale Transaction, which include its cash and Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio held as of the closing, its Alibaba Shares, its Yahoo Japan Shares, the Minority Investments, and all of the equity in Excalibur (which owns the Excalibur IP Assets), and Yahoos remaining liabilities will consist solely of the liabilities retained in the Sale Transaction, which include the Convertible Notes, securityholder litigation, 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by Yahoo (collectively, the Data Breaches), and certain director and officer indemnification obligations. As a result, Yahoo, which will change its name to Altaba Inc. upon the closing, will be required to register and be regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The financial information regarding the Fund included in the section of this proxy statement entitled Proposal 1The Sale TransactionFinancial Information of the proxy statement and this Annex 1 includes estimates of expenses the Fund will incur as a standalone company after the Sale Transaction, and may not be representative of the Funds actual future expenses.

The Funds use of service providers means that the Fund is reliant on third parties to perform their obligations.

The Fund will rely on service providers for certain functions that are integral to the Funds operations and financial performance, including management of its Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, custody of its assets and transfer agency, compliance, and administrative services. Failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the Fund in accordance with the terms of its appointment, to exercise due care and skill, or to perform its obligations to the Fund at all as a result of insolvency, bankruptcy, or other causes could have a material adverse effect on the Funds performance and returns to stockholders. The termination of the Funds relationship with any service provider, or any delay in appointing a replacement for such service provider, could

materially disrupt the business of the Fund and could have a material adverse effect on the Funds performance and returns to stockholders.

The Fund relies on the competence and continued service of its own officers and directors to manage the Fund, other than the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

The Fund will be internally managed by its executive officers under the supervision of the Board and does not currently intend to depend on a third-party investment adviser, except that Yahoo currently anticipates that the Fund will hire one or more external investment advisers to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. The Fund will incur the operating expenses associated with employing its executive officers and employees. The Fund depends upon the members of its senior management for the monitoring of the Funds investments, other than the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. If the Fund loses the services of any senior management members the Fund may not be able to operate its business as expected, which could cause the Funds results to suffer. The Funds status as a registered investment company may limit its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.

The Fund expects to hire one or more external investment advisers to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

The Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio is expected to be managed by one or more external investment advisers, who will, in doing so, apply the investment guidelines described above under Investment Guidelines for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. There can be no assurances that the Funds investment program for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, as implemented by such external investment adviser(s), will be successful. An external investment advisers investment strategies may not produce the desired results for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. Additionally, the investment guidelines for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio may constrain the investment discretion of an external investment adviser in a manner that results in the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio achieving less desirable results than if such investment guidelines were different or did not exist. Moreover, an external investment adviser may fail to adhere to the investment guidelines for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, which could result in losses, less desirable results or a greater risk profile for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio than the Fund intends. There is no guarantee that an external investment adviser will be able to achieve desirable results for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

By hiring one or more external investment advisers to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, the Fund will be subject to the risks associated with having a third-party exercise discretion over the investment of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

The Fund is subject to external management risk because its Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio is expected to be actively managed by one or more external investment advisers. Such external investment adviser(s) will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results.

A risk of loss also exists due to fraud on the part of any external investment adviser(s), intentional or inadvertent deviations from the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolios investment guidelines or simply poor judgment. Although the Fund believes the external investment adviser or advisers ultimately hired by the Fund will operate with integrity and sound operational and organizational standards, the Fund may have no, or only limited, access to information regarding the activities of such external investment adviser(s), and the Fund cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. As a consequence, although the Fund will monitor the activities of such external investment adviser(s), it may be difficult, if not impossible, for the Fund to protect itself from the risk of fraud, misrepresentation or material strategy alteration. The Fund will have no control over the day-to-day operations of the external investment adviser or advisers ultimately hired by the Fund. The failure of operations, information technology systems or contingency/disaster recovery plans may result in significant losses for the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

Fund service providers, including any external investment advisers hired by the Fund, may be the subject to cyber-attacks that could have severe negative impacts on the Fund.

With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct business, the Fund is susceptible to operational, information security and related risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through hacking or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures or breaches by one or more external investment advisers hired by the Fund to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio, or other service providers (including, but not limited to, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), and the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, interference with the Funds ability to calculate its NAV, impediments to trading, the inability of stockholders to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund intends to establish business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, cyber-attacks against its systems, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund and issuers in which the Fund invests. The Fund and its stockholders could be negatively impacted as a result.

Misconduct or misrepresentations by employees of the Fund, one or more external investment advisers hired by the Fund to manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio or any of the Funds other service providers could cause significant losses to the Fund.

Employee misconduct may include binding the Fund to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks and unauthorized trading activities, concealing unsuccessful trading activities (which, in any case, may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses) or making misrepresentations regarding any of the foregoing. Losses could also result from actions by the Funds service providers, including, without limitation, failing to recognize trades and misappropriating assets. In addition, employees and service providers may improperly use or disclose confidential information, which could result in litigation or serious financial harm, including limiting the Funds business prospects or future marketing activities. Despite the Funds due diligence efforts, misconduct and intentional misrepresentations may be undetected or not fully comprehended, thereby potentially undermining the Funds due diligence efforts. As a result, no assurances can be given that the due diligence performed by the Fund will identify or prevent any such misconduct.

As a non-diversified investment company, the Funds investment performance is at risk from fluctuations in Alibabas and Yahoo Japans performance.

The Fund currently intends to be a non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act. As a result, there are no regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act that limit the proportion of the Funds assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer and, immediately after completion of the Sale Transaction, the Funds assets will be primarily invested in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. As a consequence, the aggregate returns the Fund realizes may be adversely affected if its investment in Alibaba or its investment in Yahoo Japan performs poorly. To the extent that the Funds investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan remain a large portion of its assets, the Funds returns may fluctuate as a result of any single economic, political, or regulatory occurrence affecting, or in the markets assessment of, Alibaba or Yahoo Japan to a greater extent than those of a diversified investment company.

The Funds investments are concentrated in the online services and e-commerce industry, and risks associated with this industry may adversely affect the Funds investments.

The Funds investments will be concentrated in the online services and e-commerce industry. Because the Fund is focused in a specific industry, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. A downturn in the online services and e-commerce industry may have a larger impact on the Fund than on an investment company that does not concentrate in such industry. At times, the performance of securities of companies in the online services and e-commerce industry will lag behind the performance of other industries or the broader market as a whole.

Alibaba operates a platform for third parties to sell products through its website. Yahoo Japan provides a wide range of online services to internet users in Japan, from search and information listing to community and e-commerce. Alibaba and Yahoo Japan encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by Internet-based businesses, including risks related to their ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and their ability to operate, support, expand, and develop their Internet operations, website, software, and other related operational systems.

Any compromise of Alibabas or Yahoo Japans online security or misappropriation of proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the Funds investments. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by Alibaba or Yahoo Japan to protect client transaction data. Anyone who is able to circumvent Alibabas or Yahoo Japans security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause material interruptions in Alibabas or Yahoo Japans operations. Alibaba or Yahoo Japan may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. To the extent that Alibabas or Yahoo Japans activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could damage Alibabas or Yahoo Japans reputation and expose them to a risk of loss and/or litigation which might adversely impact the Funds investment performance.

The online and e-commerce business is dependent upon the continued use of the Internet by consumers via computers and mobile devices. The ways in which consumers access and use the Internet rapidly evolve, and there can be no assurance that these changes will not adversely affect the industry.

New regulation or changes to existing regulation of Internet services and e-commerce companies could adversely affect Alibabas or Yahoo Japans profitability and operations and the value of the Funds investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.

E-commerce companies sometime receive communications alleging that items or content offered or sold through their online marketplaces by third parties, or that they make available through other services such as online music platforms, infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Moreover, e-commerce companies receive negative publicity regarding the sales of counterfeit and pirated items or content on their marketplaces. Continued public perception that counterfeit or pirated items or content are commonplace on e-commerce marketplaces, or perceived delays in removal of these items or content from e-commerce marketplaces, even if factually incorrect, can damage the reputation of e-commerce companies, result in lower list prices for items or content sold through their marketplaces, harm e-commerce business, and adversely affect the value of the Funds investments.

Limitations imposed by the 1940 Act may adversely affect the Funds operations.

The Fund is a registered closed-end management investment company and as such is subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act regulates many aspects of the Funds operations and imposes limitations such as limiting the Funds ability to:

These and other limitations imposed by the 1940 Act may adversely affect the Funds operations and returns to investors.

If the Fund were unable to claim an exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator due to the Funds trading activity, the Fund would face additional regulatory requirements and increased expenses.

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rule 4.5 permits registered investment companies to claim an exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act, provided specified requirements are met. In order to claim this exclusion, the Fund will limit its transactions, if any, in futures, options on futures, and swaps (excluding transactions entered into for bona fide hedging purposes, as defined under CFTC regulations) such that either: (1) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish its futures, options on futures, and swaps do not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of the Funds portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions; or (2) the aggregate net notional value of its futures, options on futures, and swaps does not exceed 100 percent of the liquidation value of the Funds portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions. Accordingly, the Fund will not be subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act or otherwise regulated by the CFTC. If the Fund were to be unable to claim the exclusion, due to the Funds trading activity, such as an increased use of derivatives, or a change in the registration requirements for commodity pool operators, the Fund would become subject to registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator, which would subject the Fund to additional registration and regulatory requirements and increased operating expenses.

The Funds Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio will be exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates.

The Funds exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates will primarily relate to its Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. The Fund will invest excess cash in money market funds, time deposits, and liquid debt instruments of the U.S. and foreign governments and their agencies, and high-credit corporate issuers which are classified as marketable debt securities and cash equivalents.

Investments in fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, the Funds future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the Fund may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or changes in credit quality. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in the fair value of the Funds debt securities of $28 million and $35 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

The Fund will be exposed to litigation and investigations, including litigation and investigations arising out of the Excluded Assets and the Retained Liabilities or related to the Sale Transaction.

The Fund will be subject to pending litigation, and may become subject to further litigation, including litigation arising out of the Excluded Assets and the Retained Liabilities or related to entering into the Sale Transaction. This litigation will include actions by third parties against the Fund, as well as direct actions by the Funds securityholders against the directors and/or officers of the Fund for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty or derivative actions brought by Fund stockholders in the name of the Fund.

The Fund will further be exposed to certain liabilities arising out of the Data Breaches (See SummaryThe Sale TransactionThe Sale Transaction Overview), which may have an adverse impact on the Fund. Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will retain certain liabilities arising out of governmental or third party investigations, litigation or claims related to the Data Breaches. (See The Sale Transaction AgreementsThe Reorganization AgreementRetained Liabilities.) As of April 20, 2017, the Company was facing approximately 42 putative consumer class action lawsuits, two putative stockholder class actions on behalf of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Companys stock between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016 and six stockholder derivative actions, two of which also assert class claims on behalf of current stockholders of Yahoo, and other lawsuits and claims may be asserted by or on behalf of users, partners, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the Data Breaches. The Company was also facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies.

These claims and investigations may adversely affect how the Fund operates its business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the Fund, and result in additional costs and potential fines. These potential actions and potential liabilities could also have a significant adverse impact on the Funds net asset value and could delay any actions or transactions aimed at returning assets to stockholders or realizing value for stockholders through transactions involving portfolio assets.

Risks Related to the Funds Common Stock and the Securities Market Following the Sale Transaction

An active trading market for the Funds common stock might not develop.

There is a risk that an active trading market might not develop or be sustained for the Funds common stock after the Sale Transaction. Yahoo cannot predict the prices at which the Funds common stock may trade after the Sale Transaction or whether the market value of the Funds common stock after the Sale Transaction will be less than, equal to, or greater than the market value of Yahoo common stock prior to the Sale Transaction or the net asset value of the Funds common stock after the Sale Transaction.

The market price of the Funds common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond the Funds control, including:

Shares of the Funds common stock may trade at a substantial discount from net asset value.

Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from net asset value, which is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Funds net asset value could decrease as a result of its investment activities. Although the value of the Funds net assets are generally considered by market participants in determining whether to purchase or sell the Funds common stock, whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of the Funds common stock will depend entirely upon whether the market price of the Funds common stock at the time of sale is above or below the investors purchase price for the Funds common stock. Because the market price of the Funds common stock will be determined by factors beyond the control of the Fund, such as supply of and demand for the Funds common stock, trading volume of the Funds common stock, general market and economic conditions, and other factors, the Fund cannot predict whether the Funds common stock will trade at, below, or above net asset value. The risk that the Funds common stock may trade at a price below its net asset value may be greater in the period after the Fund registers as an investment company under the 1940 Act because certain stockholders may need to divest their ownership of the Funds common stock because it may be removed from the Standard and Poors 500 Index and other indices, because they are not permitted to own stock issued by a registered investment company or for other reasons. In addition, the price of

the Funds common stock may be adversely affected by the ability of investors to invest directly in Alibaba Shares and Yahoo Japan Shares and not be subject to the fees and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with its operations, which may also reduce the liquidity of the Funds common stock which, in turn, may make the market price of the Funds common stock more volatile.

The Funds directors and executive officers are expected to be compensated, in part, with deferred compensation based on attainment of performance targets pre-established by the Board.

The Funds Compensation Committee intends to adopt a deferred compensation plan for the Funds directors and executive officers that may create an incentive for Fund management to make riskier and more speculative decisions than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement, which could lead to adverse consequences for the Fund and stockholders. For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, see the section of this Annex 1 entitled Management of the FundCompensation of Officers and DirectorsOfficer CompensationLong-Term Deferred Compensation.

Delaware statutes and certain provisions in the Funds certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Fund.

Under the Funds certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the Board has the authority to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of the Funds common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control of the Fund without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of the Funds common stock.

The Funds certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in the Funds management, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Funds stock and the value of the $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of the Funds Convertible Notes. In addition, the Funds certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third-party to gain control of the Board. Further, the Fund is subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit the Fund from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Fund.

Any of these provisions could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of the Funds common stock and Convertible Notes.

Regulatory changes under the new administration may adversely affect the Funds assets or result in changes to its investment objectives and policies.

The Funds current investment objective and policies were adopted based on current statutes, regulations, and policies applicable to United States financial markets and institutions, corporation taxation, and international trade. The Fund cannot predict which statutes, regulations, or policies will be changed or repealed under the administration of President Donald Trump, or if changes are made, their effect on the value of the Funds assets. Because the Funds investment objective and policies are not fundamental, the Fund retains the right to change them in response to any such changes or for any other reason if the Board of Directors determines such changes to be in the best interests of stockholders. Examples of changes to the Funds investment objective and policies

include: retaining assets that otherwise would have been sold; selling assets that otherwise would have been retained; selling assets on an accelerated or delayed time frame; diversifying the Funds assets to seek to minimize losses, to enhance gains or to seek to become a regulated investment company under the Code; and changing the way the Fund uses derivatives to seek to hedge against or profit from possible changes in the value of the Funds assets.

Risks Relating to the Funds Convertible Notes After the Sale Transaction

The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect the Funds financial condition and operating results.

In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered after the completion of the Sale Transaction, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods after the completion of the Sale Transaction at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless the Fund elects to satisfy its conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of the Funds common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), the Fund would be required to settle a portion or all of its conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect the Funds liquidity or cause the Fund to sell assets at a time it would not otherwise choose to do so.

The Fund may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a Fundamental Change, and the Funds future debt may contain limitations on its ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.

Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Fund to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change at a repurchase price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. The Fund may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time the Fund is required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefore, or pay cash with respect to Convertible Notes being converted if the Fund elects not to issue shares, which could harm its reputation and affect the trading price of its common stock.

The Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions may affect the value of the Funds Convertible Notes and the Funds common stock.

The Fund will continue to be a party to Hedge Transactions following the completion of the Sale Transaction as long as the Convertible Notes remain outstanding. The Hedge Transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Fund is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. The Fund will also continue to be a party to the Warrant Transactions following the completion of the Sale Transaction. However, the Warrant Transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of the Funds common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants, in which case the Fund would be prohibited under the 1940 Act from issuing shares to satisfy its obligations under the Warrant Transactions. If the Fund is required to sell assets to satisfy its obligations under the Warrant Transactions in cash, it may be required to do so at a time that is disadvantageous to the Fund and its stockholders. The initial strike price of the warrants was $71.24 per share of common stock. Counterparties to the Warrant Transactions may make adjustments to certain terms of the warrants upon the occurrence of specified events, including the announcement of the Stock Purchase Agreement, if the event results in a material change to the trading price of Yahoos common stock or the value of the warrants. To date, two counterparties have given Yahoo notices of adjustments reducing their warrant exercise prices.

In connection with establishing their initial hedge of the Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of the Funds common stock and/or

entered into various derivative transactions with respect to the Funds common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Funds common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Funds common stock or other securities of the Fund in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of Convertible Notes by the Fund on any fundamental repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Funds common stock or the Convertible Notes.

Any adverse change in the rating of the Convertible Notes or the Fund may cause their trading price to decline.

While Yahoo did not solicit a credit rating on Yahoo or on the Convertible Notes, one rating service has rated both the Convertible Notes and Yahoo. If that rating service announces its intention to put the Fund or the Convertible Notes on credit watch or lowers its rating on the Fund or the Convertible Notes below any rating initially assigned to the Fund or the Convertible Notes, the trading price of the Convertible Notes could decline.

The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on the Funds reported financial results.

In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders equity on the Funds consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, the Fund will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. The Fund will report lower net income in its financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include the current periods amortization of the debt discount, which could adversely affect the Funds reported or future financial results, the trading price of the Funds common stock, and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.

In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of net income per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for net income per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of the Funds common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if the Fund elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. The Fund cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If the Fund is unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then its net income per share would be adversely affected.

The Fund may not be able to successfully monetize or realize meaningful value from the licensing and/or sale of the Excalibur IP Assets, and the Fund may not be able to sufficiently develop, maintain or protect the Excalibur IP Assets.

The Fund will explore opportunities to monetize the Excalibur IP Assets through the licensing or sale of all or a portion of the Excalibur IP Assets. However, there is no assurance the Fund will be successful in monetizing or realizing meaningful value from such efforts. In addition, if the Fund is unable to effectively enforce any of the Excalibur IP Assets to prohibit unauthorized use and other exploitation thereof by third parties, the value of such assets may be adversely impacted. Enforcing the Excalibur IP Assets is expensive and time-consuming, and the Excalibur IP Assets will only have value for a limited amount of time. Potential licensees and other third parties may challenge the validity, scope, enforceability, or ownership of the Excalibur IP Assets, which may further increase the cost of maintaining them. In addition, patent laws in the U.S. and abroad may continue to change, and such changes may create additional challenges to the Funds monetization activities. For instance, during 2013 and 2015, various new laws were proposed and considered to address various perceived abuses of the patent system by patent assertion entities.

The Fund will register as an investment company under the 1940 Act immediately after the closing of the Sale Transaction. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund will be obligated to send stockholder reports to stockholders semi-annually and to publicly file with the SEC reports of its portfolio holdings after both the first and third fiscal quarters each year. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a registered investment company and its affiliates, principal underwriters, and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that a registered investment company may not change the nature of its business so as to cease to be an investment company, change from a closed-end fund to an open-end fund, or deviate from fundamental investment policies unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities, which is defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of a majority of the outstanding voting securities or 67 percent or more of the securities voting if a quorum of a majority of the outstanding voting securities is present. The Fund has adopted the fundamental investment policies set forth under the section of this Annex 1 entitled Investment Objective and PoliciesFundamental Investment Restrictions. Stockholders will also be entitled to certain other voting rights granted under the 1940 Act such as electing directors in certain circumstances required under the 1940 Act, approving any investment advisory contracts, and terminating the employment of the Funds independent public accountant. After the Funds registration statement is filed with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act stockholders will be able to obtain a copy of the registration statement at the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

The Fund is permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple series of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to its common stock if the Fund meets the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, the Fund must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to its stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless the Fund meets the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. The Fund may also borrow amounts up to five percent of the value of its total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. See the section of this Annex 1 entitled Leverage for additional information about the Funds use of leverage.

The Fund may not issue and sell its common stock at a price below net asset value per share, except in connection with an offering to the holders of one or more classes of its capital stock, with the consent of a majority of its holders of the Funds common stock, upon conversion of a convertible security in accordance with its terms, or upon the exercise of any warrant issued in accordance with the 1940 Act.

The Fund will be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without the prior approval of the SEC.

The Fund will be subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.

The Fund will be required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect it against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a registered investment company, the Fund is prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to the Fund or its stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office.

The business and affairs of the Fund generally will be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund, and the Board of Directors of the Fund will oversee the management of the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio by one or more external investment adviser(s). Upon the completion of the Sale Transaction, the size of the Funds Board of Directors will be five members. The Company expects that, immediately following completion of the Sale Transaction, the Funds Board of Directors will include the four individuals listed below, three of whom will not be interested persons, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Fund (the Independent Directors), and one of whom will be an interested person of the Fund (the Interested Director). The Company has initiated a search for a candidate to serve as a fourth Independent Director of the Fund immediately following the closing of the Sale Transaction. If a new director is not appointed at such time, the Board of Directors of the Fund will seek to fill the vacancy as soon as practicable after the closing. The Funds Board of Directors will elect the officers of the Fund, who will serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

Process for Stockholders to Communicate with the Board

The Board of the Fund intends to establish a process to receive communications from stockholders and other interested parties. Stockholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of the Board, or the non-employee directors as a group, any Board committee or any chair of any committee by mail or electronically. To communicate with the Board or any member, group or committee thereof, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or any member, group or committee thereof by name or title. All such correspondence should be sent to Secretary of Altaba Inc. at 140 East 45th Street, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10017 or electronically to secretary@altaba.com.

Eric K. Brandt, an Independent Director, will be the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Yahoos Board of Directors has determined that having an Independent Director serve as the non-executive

Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Fund is in the best interests of stockholders of the Fund because it allows the Chairman to focus on the effectiveness and independence of the Funds Board of Directors while the Chief Executive Officer focuses on executing the Funds strategy and managing the Funds operations and performance.

The Funds Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, will serve an active role in overseeing management of the Funds risks. The Funds officers will be responsible for day-to-day risk management activities. The Funds full Board of Directors will monitor risks through regular reports from each of the committee chairs, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer, and will be apprised of particular risk management matters in connection with its general oversight and approval of corporate matters. The Funds Board of Directors and each committee thereof will oversee risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility, as summarized below. The Independent Directors of the Fund will meet in regularly scheduled sessions without management. The Chair of the Board will chair the executive sessions of the Funds Board of Directors.

The Funds Audit Committee (the Audit Committee) will review risks and exposures associated with financial matters, particularly financial reporting, tax, accounting, disclosures, internal control over financial reporting, and credit and liquidity matters, programs and policies relating to legal compliance and strategy, and the Funds operational infrastructure, particularly reliability, business continuity and capacity. The Funds Audit Committee will meet with key management personnel and representatives of outside advisers as required. The Audit Committees Charter will be made available on the Funds website following the Sale Transaction.

The Funds Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) will discuss and review compensation arrangements for the Funds executive officers and other compensation programs to avoid incentives that would promote excessive risk-taking that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Fund. The Compensation Committees Charter will be made available on the Funds website following the Sale Transaction.

The Funds Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the Nominating Committee) will oversee risks associated with operations of the Funds Board of Directors and its governance structure. The Nominating Committees Charter will be made available on the Funds website following the Sale Transaction.

Yahoos Board of Directors believes that the processes it has established for overseeing risk would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks with respect to the Fund and therefore do not materially affect its choice of leadership structure as described under The Boards Leadership Structure above.

Tor R. Braham, Eric K. Brandt, and Catherine J. Friedman, who are Independent Directors, will serve on the Audit Committee of the Fund. Mr. Brandt will serve as chair of the Funds Audit Committee. The overall purpose of the Funds Audit Committee will be to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Fund and the audits of the Funds financial statements.

The Funds Audit Committee will generally be responsible for reviewing and evaluating issues related to the accounting and financial reporting policies and internal controls of the Fund, overseeing the audit of the Funds financial statements, and acting as a liaison between the Funds Board of Directors and the Funds independent registered public accounting firm.

Yahoos Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Brandt qualifies as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of SEC rules and satisfies the financial sophistication requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards.

Ms. Friedman and Mr. Brandt, who are Independent Directors, will serve on the Compensation Committee of the Fund. Ms. Friedman will serve as the chair of the Funds Compensation Committee. The primary purpose of the Funds Compensation Committee will be to oversee the Funds compensation and employee benefit plans and practices. The Funds Compensation Committee will generally be responsible for reviewing the Funds compensation and benefits plans, reviewing and approving the compensation levels of executive officers, reviewing and approving employment, severance or termination arrangements, establishing stock ownership guidelines and reviewing and recommending to the Funds Board of Directors any changes in the compensation paid to the Funds non-employee directors.

Ms. Friedman and Mr. Brandt, who are Independent Directors, will serve on the Nominating Committee of the Fund. Mr. Brandt will serve as the chair of the Funds Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee will generally be responsible for identifying and recommending individuals qualified to serve as directors of the Fund, advising on matters related to board composition, procedures and committees, assessing the appropriateness of a director nominee who does not receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election, assessing the appropriateness of a director who retires or experiences a change in his or her principal occupation, employer, or principal business affiliation, and overseeing the annual self-assessment of each individual directors performance and the annual evaluation of the Funds Board of Directors and its committees.

The Funds Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. In considering director candidates, whether submitted by management, members of the Funds Board of Directors, stockholders, or other persons, the Funds Nominating Committee will consider the qualifications and suitability of the candidate, and with regard to a candidate submitted by a stockholder, may also consider the number of shares of the Funds Common Stock held by the recommending stockholder and the length of time that such shares have been held.

To have a candidate considered by the Funds Nominating Committee, a stockholder must submit the recommendation in writing and must include the following information:

The Funds Nominating Committee may require additional information as it deems reasonably required to determine the eligibility of the director candidate to serve as a member of the Funds Board of Directors.

The stockholder recommendation and information described above must be sent to the chair of the Nominating Committee in care of the Funds Secretary at 140 East 45th Street, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10017. For a candidate to be considered by the Funds Nominating Committee for nomination to the Funds Board of Directors at an upcoming annual meeting, a stockholder recommendation must be received by the Corporate Secretary not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the Funds or Companys most recent annual meeting of stockholders.

Pursuant to its charter, the Funds Nominating Committees criteria for evaluating potential candidates will be consistent with the Board of Directors criteria for selecting new directors. Such criteria will include the

possession of such knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, integrity, diversity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, and understanding of the Funds business environment as may enhance the Board of Directors ability to manage and direct the affairs and business of the Fund and, when applicable, the ability of Board committees to fulfill their duties, considered in the context of the Committees assessment of the perceived needs of the Board of Directors at that time. The Funds Nominating Committee may also take into account, as applicable, the satisfaction of any independence requirements imposed by any applicable laws, regulations or rules and the Corporate Governance Guidelines.

While the Funds Nominating Committee will not have formal objective criteria for determining the diversity desired or represented on the Funds Board of Directors, the committee will also consider and assess the effect that potential candidates may have on Board of Directors diversity (which may include, among other things, an assessment of gender, age, race, national origin, education, professional experience, and differences in viewpoints and skills) when evaluating the Board of Directors composition and recommending candidates for nomination.

In connection with the Funds Nominating Committees consideration of a potential director candidate, the committee may also collect and review publicly available information regarding the person to assess the suitability of the candidate and determine whether the person should be considered further. If the Funds Nominating Committee determines that the candidate warrants further consideration, the chair or another member of the Funds Nominating Committee may contact the candidate. Generally, if the candidate expresses a willingness to be considered and to serve on the Funds Board of Directors, the Funds Nominating Committee may request information from the candidate, review his or her accomplishments and qualifications and conduct one or more interviews with the candidate and members of the committee or other members of the Funds Board of Directors. The Funds Nominating Committee may consider all this information in light of information regarding other candidates that the Funds Nominating Committee is evaluating for membership on the Funds Board of Directors. In certain instances, members of the Funds Nominating Committee or Board of Directors may contact one or more references provided by the candidate or may contact other members of the business community or other persons that may have first-hand knowledge of the candidates accomplishments. The Funds Nominating Committees evaluation process will not vary based on the source of a recommendation of a candidate, although, as stated above, in the case of a candidate recommended by a stockholder, the Funds Board of Directors may take into consideration the number of shares of the Funds common stock held by the recommending stockholder and the length of time that such shares have been held.

The following table provides information regarding the estimated compensation that is contemplated to be paid to each director and each of the executive officers of the Fund with aggregate compensation from the Fund in excess of $60,000, assuming a full fiscal year of operations of the Fund as an investment company. The Fund is not part of a fund complex and therefore only aggregate estimated compensation from the Fund is shown.

Each of Mr. McInerney, Mr. Chong, Ms. Wellman, and Ms. Work has entered into an offer letter setting forth the terms and conditions of his or her employment with the Fund, which offer letter will become effective on the date of the closing of the Sale Transaction, other than Mr. Chong whose offer letter became effective on March 10, 2017. The letters have no specified term, and each officers employment with the Fund is on an at-will basis.

Base Salary and Target Bonus. The letters set forth the following annual base salary for each executive officer: Mr. McInerney  $2 million, Mr. Chong  $1 million, Ms. Wellman  $500,000, and Ms. Work  $400,000. Each executive officer will be eligible for a cash annual incentive award targeted at the following percentages of the executive officers annual base salary (each percentage, a Target Bonus): Mr. McInerney  100 percent, Mr. Chong  100 percent, Ms. Wellman  75 percent, and Ms. Work  75 percent. Mr. Chongs annual incentive award for his first year after closing of the Sale Transaction will be increased pro rata to reflect his services to Yahoo as an outside legal advisor from October 31, 2016 to March 9, 2017 and thereafter as General Counsel and Secretary through the closing of the Sale Transaction.

Long-Term Deferred Compensation. Each officer disclosed in the table above is eligible for grants of long-term deferred compensation governed by the terms of the Plan. The deferred amounts payable to each officer under the Plan will be based on attainment of performance targets pre-established by the Board. The Plan will

provide for a threshold value and range of payments that each officer may receive based on attainment of the pre-established performance targets:

The Company is currently seeking no-action relief from the staff of the SEC with respect to the Plan that the Board expects to adopt after the closing of the Sale Transaction. There can be no assurance the staff of the SEC will grant the requested relief. If the SEC staff does not grant the Companys no-action relief as requested, the Compensation Committee will seek to modify the Plan in a manner acceptable to the SEC staff and/or seek other forms of relief from the SEC and its staff, or adopt other alternative compensatory arrangements. Although the terms of any such modified Plan, other relief, or other alternative compensatory arrangements cannot be known at this time, the terms may include a modified version of the Plan described above, discretionary cash bonuses or additional base salary.

Severance Benefits. In the event an officers employment terminates without cause or as a result of a resignation for good reason (each, as defined in the offer letters), the officer will be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits, subject to the execution of an effective release of claims against the Fund: (i) a lump sum payment equal to 12 months (or, for Mr. McInerney, 18 months) of base salary; (ii) a pro rata portion of the officers annual incentive award based on actual performance, payable at the time such award would otherwise have been paid, (iii) any portion of the deferred compensation to which the officer is entitled pursuant to the terms of the Plan and (iv) subject to the officers timely and proper election for continued coverage under COBRA, reimbursement by the Fund for COBRA premiums paid by the officer for a period of 12 months (or, for Mr. McInerney, 18 months) following the officers termination of employment. In addition, in the event of a change in control (as defined in the letters), each officer will automatically receive the above payments and benefits, subject to the officers execution of an effective release of claims against the Fund; provided, that, in lieu of the pro rata annual incentive award described in clause (ii) above, the officer will be entitled to an amount equal to his or her Target Bonus, payable in lump sum within 10 business days following the effective date of the release of claims.

Each officer in the table above also will be eligible to participate in the benefit programs generally available to other officers and employees of the Fund and to accrue paid time off days in accordance with the Funds post-closing vacation or paid time off policy.

Each officer in the table above will also be eligible to participate in the Funds 401(k) plan and health and welfare benefit programs which will be made available to the Funds employees generally.

There are no arrangements or understandings between any of Mr. McInerney, Mr. Chong, Ms. Wellman, or Ms. Work and any other person pursuant to which he or she was selected as an executive officer of the Fund, and there are no family relationships between any of Mr. McInerney, Mr. Chong, Ms. Wellman, or Ms. Work and any of the Funds other directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by the Fund to become a director or executive officer.

None of Mr. McInerney, Mr. Chong, Ms. Wellman, or Ms. Work has any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of except as set forth in this section, and, in the case of Mr. Chong, his retention agreement with Yahoo pursuant to which he served as an

outside legal advisor to Yahoo from October 31, 2016 to March 9, 2017 in exchange for $100,000 per month and reimbursement for reasonable out of pocket expenses (including a car service) and, in the case of Ms. Work, her existing retention agreement with Yahoo pursuant to which she has served as an outside legal advisor to Yahoo since December 8, 2016 in exchange for $50,000 per month and reimbursement for reasonable out of pocket expenses.

As compensation for serving on the Board, each Independent Director will receive an annual retainer of $350,000 and the chair of the Board will receive an additional retainer of $80,000 for his or her additional services in this capacity. Each Independent Director will receive reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such attendance. In addition, the chair of the Funds Audit Committee will receive an annual retainer of $40,000 and each Audit Committee member will receive an annual retainer of $20,000 for their additional services in these capacities. The chair of any other committee will receive an annual retainer of $25,000 and each member of any other committee will receive an annual retainer of $10,000 for their additional services in these capacities. All amounts will be paid quarterly, subject to any deferred retainer amounts (described below), and amounts will be pro-rated for partial periods of service.

Up to half of the aggregate retainers will be paid as cash compensation, and it is intended that at least half of the aggregate retainers earned from the completion of the Sale Transaction to the third anniversary of the first annual stockholder meeting held after the completion of the Sale Transaction will be paid as deferred compensation on generally the same terms as described above for the Funds officers, though an Independent Director may elect to defer up to all of his or her retainer.

In addition, the Fund will maintain directors and officers liability insurance on behalf of its directors and officers. Interested Directors receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board.

The table below provides the dollar range of equity securities beneficially owned by each director in the Fund as of April 3, 2017.

Yahoo currently anticipates that the Fund will hire one or more external investment advisers to manage its Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. The 1940 Act requires any agreement pursuant to which an investment adviser provides the Fund advice with respect to the Funds securities to be approved by the Funds board of directors, including a majority of the Funds Independent Directors, and by the Funds stockholders. The Funds

directors anticipate meeting shortly after the completion of the Sale Transaction to vote on interim investment advisory agreements with one or more external investment advisers and then meeting in-person as soon as practicable to vote on the agreements as required under the 1940 Act and to call a meeting of the Funds stockholders to vote on the agreements. The Fund directors have not yet negotiated an investment advisory agreement with any external investment adviser or completed due diligence with respect to any external investment adviser, and no assurance can be given that any particular external investment adviser will manage the Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio.

The following summary of the Funds capital stock does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Funds certificate of incorporation. Reference is made to the Funds certificate of incorporation for a detailed description of the provisions summarized below. Yahoos existing certificate of incorporation, after giving effect to the Charter Amendment (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled The Special MeetingPurpose) and the change of the Companys name to Altaba Inc., will be the certificate of incorporation of the Fund.

The following are the classes of capital stock of the Fund assuming the Sale Transaction had taken place as of April 20, 2017.

The holders of the Funds common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of the Funds common stock will be entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the Board out of funds legally available for that purpose. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Fund, the holders of the Funds common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to the prior distribution rights of any outstanding preferred stock. The Funds common stock will have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Funds common stock. The outstanding shares of the Funds common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable.

The Fund has no present intention of offering any additional shares of the Funds common stock. Any offerings of the Funds common stock will require approval by the Board. Any offering of the Funds common stock will be subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, which provides that shares of the Funds common stock may not be issued at a price below the Funds then-current net asset value, exclusive of sales load, except in connection with an offering to existing holders of the Funds common stock, or with the consent of a majority of the Funds outstanding voting securities.

The Funds common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq but its ticker symbol will change to AABA. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds like the Fund do not continuously offer shares and do not provide daily redemptions. Rather, if a stockholder determines to buy additional shares of the Funds common stock or sell the Funds common stock already held, the stockholder may do so by trading through a broker on

Nasdaq or otherwise. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade on an exchange at prices lower than net asset value. Shares of closed-end investment companies like the Fund have during some periods traded at prices higher than net asset value and during other periods have traded at prices lower than net asset value. Because the market value of the Funds common stock may be influenced by such factors beyond the control of the Fund, such as the relative demand for and supply of shares of the Funds common stock in the market and general market and economic conditions, the Fund cannot assure you that shares of the Funds common stock will trade at a price equal to or higher than net asset value in the future.

Assuming the Sale Transaction had closed as of December 31, 2016, the Fund would have had approximately 8,736 record holders of the Funds common stock (which amount does not include the number of stockholders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, or other nominees, but instead includes all such institutions as one holder).

The Board will have the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, in one or more series. The Board will also have the authority to designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of each such series, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences, and the number of shares constituting any series.

The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of the Fund without further action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the Funds common stock. In certain circumstances, an issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the Funds common stock.

Under the 1940 Act, the Fund is not permitted to issue preferred stock unless immediately after such issuance the value of the Funds total assets are at least 200 percent of the liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock (i.e., the liquidation value may not exceed 50 percent of the Funds total assets). In addition, under the 1940 Act, the Fund is not permitted to declare any cash dividend or other distribution on its common stock unless, at the time of such declaration, the value of the Funds total assets are at least 200 percent of such liquidation value. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that the holders of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times, and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more.

No shares of preferred stock of Yahoo are currently outstanding. The Fund currently has no plans to issue preferred stock, but it reserves the right to do so to the full extent permitted by the 1940 Act.

As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo has $1.4 billion in principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding. If Yahoo does not repurchase the Convertible Notes prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction, then the Convertible Notes will remain senior unsecured obligations of the Fund and will rank senior in right of payment to any Fund indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. The Convertible Notes mature on December 1, 2018, unless previously purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Fund may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of the Funds common stock at an initial conversion rate of 18.7161 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately

$53.43 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. See the section of this Annex 1 entitled LeverageConvertible Notes for additional information about the Convertible Notes.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE FUNDS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS

The description set forth below is intended as a summary of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Fund, effective after the closing of the Sale Transaction.

The Funds certificate of incorporation will include provisions limiting the liability of the Funds directors for monetary damages to the extent permitted under Delaware law and the 1940 Act, except that there is no limitation on the liability of the Funds directors (1) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Fund or its stockholders, (2) for so long as the Fund is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, in the performance of the directors duties or by reason of the directors reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office, (3) for unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The effect of these provisions in the Funds certificate of incorporation will be to eliminate the Funds rights and the stockholders rights (through stockholders derivative suits on behalf of the Fund) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director under Delaware law except in specified limited circumstances. This provision does not limit or eliminate the Funds rights or any stockholders rights to seek nonmonetary relief such as an injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a directors duty of care. These provisions will not alter the liability of directors under federal securities laws. These 1940 Act limitations on indemnification will not limit the obligation of the Fund to indemnify officers and directors of Yahoo for actions that occurred prior to the Funds registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act.

The Funds certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Fund that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:

Yahoo believes that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging such proposals because, among other things, negotiation of such proposals might result in an improvement of their terms.

The bylaws of the Fund provide that the number of directors shall be determined, from time to time, by a resolution of the Board. A director may be removed from the Board with or without cause, only by the

affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund then entitled to vote at an election of directors. The bylaws of the Fund provide that any vacancies arising through death, resignation, removal, an increase in the number of directors, or otherwise may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation, or removal.

The bylaws of the Fund establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of stockholders (the Stockholder Notice Procedure).

The Stockholder Notice Procedure provides that (1) only persons who are nominated by, or at the direction of, the Board, or by a stockholder who has given timely written notice containing specified information to the Funds secretary prior to the meeting at which directors are to be elected, will be eligible for election as directors and (2) at an annual meeting, only such business may be conducted as has been brought before the meeting by, or at the direction of, the Board or by a stockholder who has given timely written notice to the Funds secretary of such stockholders intention to bring such business before the meeting. Except for stockholder proposals submitted in accordance with the federal proxy rules as to which the requirements specified therein shall control, notice of stockholder nominations or business to be conducted at a meeting generally must be received by the Fund not less than 90 days or more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the previous years annual meeting if the notice is to be submitted at an annual stockholders meeting.

Yahoos bylaws currently allow eligible stockholders to include their own director nominees in Yahoos proxy materials along with the Board-nominated candidates. Among other things, this proxy access right currently:

In light of the reduction of the size of the Board to five directors following the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund anticipates that it will amend its bylaws to provide that the maximum number of stockholder candidates eligible for inclusion in the Funds proxy materials is equal to 20 percent of the directors then serving on the Board (rounded to the nearest whole number), and not the greater of two stockholder-nominated candidates or 20 percent of the directors then serving on the Board (rounded down to the nearest whole number).

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

The Funds certificate of incorporation provides that the Fund reserves the right to amend, alter, change, or repeal any provision contained therein, in the manner prescribed by Delaware statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders in the Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation.

The Funds certificate of incorporation provides that the directors shall have the power to make, alter, or repeal the Funds bylaws. The Funds bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered, or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the Board then in office.

The Fund will be a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company (commonly referred to as a closed-end fund) with no operating history as an investment company. Closed-end funds differ from open-end funds (commonly referred to as mutual funds) in that closed-end funds generally list their common stock for trading on a stock exchange and do not redeem shares of common stock at the request of the stockholder. This means that if you wish to sell your shares of common stock of a closed-end fund you must trade them on the stock exchange like any other stock at the prevailing market price at that time. In a mutual fund, if the stockholder wishes to sell shares of the fund, the mutual fund will redeem or buy back the shares at net asset value per share. Also, mutual funds generally offer new shares on a continuous basis to new investors and closed-end funds generally do not. The continuous inflows and outflows of assets in a mutual fund can make it difficult to manage the funds investments. By comparison, closed-end funds are generally able to stay more fully invested in securities that are consistent with their investment objectives and also have greater flexibility to make certain types of investments and to use certain investment strategies, such as financial leverage and investments in illiquid securities.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Because of this possibility and the recognition that any such discount may not be in the interest of stockholders, the Board might consider from time to time engaging in open-market repurchases, tender offers for shares, or other programs intended to reduce the discount. The Board also might consider from time to time engaging in open-market repurchases, tender offers for shares, or other programs intended to increase any premium to net asset value at which the Funds common stock may trade. The Fund cannot guarantee or assure, however, that the Board will decide to engage in any of these actions. Nor is there any guarantee or assurance that such actions, if undertaken, would result in the shares trading at a price equal or close to the net asset value per share or increase any premium at which such shares may trade. Although share repurchases and tender offers could have a favorable effect on the market price of the Funds common stock, the acquisition of shares of the Funds common stock by the Fund would decrease the capital of the Fund and, therefore, may have the effect of increasing the Funds expense ratio. Any share repurchases or tender offers will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the 1940 Act, and the principal stock exchange on which the Funds common stock is traded. Before deciding whether to take any action to repurchase the Funds common stock, the Board would likely consider all relevant factors, including the extent and duration of the discount, the liquidity of the Funds portfolio, tax consequences to the Fund and its stockholders, the impact of any action that might be taken on the Fund or its stockholders, and market considerations. Based on these considerations, even if the Funds shares would trade at a discount, the Board may determine that, in the interest of the Fund and its stockholders, no action should be taken. The Fund reserves the right to repurchase its common stock from time to time, including prior to the mailing of its first annual or semi-annual stockholder report after the completion of the Sale Transaction.

Although the Fund does not currently intend to regularly engage in brokerage transactions, it does expect that one or more external investment advisers will regularly engage in principal transactions with dealers in the fixed income markets in connection with the management of the Funds Marketable Debt Securities Portfolio. When engaging in any such brokerage or principal transactions, Fund management or any external investment advisers will not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but will seek to obtain the best net results for the Fund. While Fund management or any external investment advisers generally will seek reasonable trade execution costs, the Fund will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, Fund management or any external investment advisers will seek to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for the Fund, taking into account a variety of factors including: (1) the size, nature, and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (2) the desired timing of the transaction; (3) knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (4) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (5) the full range of brokerage services provided; (6) the brokers or dealers capital; (7) the quality of research and research services provided; (8) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread, or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (9) knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer.

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations for holders of the Funds common stock. This discussion is based on the Code, applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. Such authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders of the Funds common stock that are U.S. holders, as defined below, and that hold their shares of the Funds common stock as capital assets, within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. Further, this discussion does not discuss all tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Funds common stock in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it address any tax consequences to holders of the Funds common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as tax-exempt entities, partnerships (including entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), persons who acquired their shares of the Funds common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options, or otherwise as compensation, financial institutions, insurance companies, dealers, or traders in securities, and persons who hold their shares of the Funds common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, synthetic security, integrated investment, or other risk-reduction transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion does not address any U.S. federal estate, gift, or other non-income tax considerations (including the Medicare tax on net investment income), any state, local, or foreign tax considerations, or any tax reporting requirements.

For purposes of this section, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of the Funds common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of the Funds common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding shares of the Funds common stock should consult its tax advisor regarding any tax considerations related to the partnerships ownership of the Funds common stock.

U.S. Federal Income Taxation of the Fund

It is currently anticipated that, immediately after the completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will be treated as a regular corporation, or a C corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the remainder of this summary assumes such treatment. Upon completion of the Sale Transaction, the Fund will not be eligible to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company under the Code because a regulated investment company cannot invest more than 25 percent of its assets in securities of a single issuer, and more than 25 percent of the Funds assets will be invested in securities of Alibaba. Accordingly, the Fund generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at the graduated rates applicable to corporations under the Code. In addition, the Fund may be subject to an alternative minimum tax on its alternative minimum taxable income to the extent that the alternative minimum tax exceeds the Funds regular income tax liability. The extent to which the Fund is required to pay U.S. corporate income tax or alternative minimum tax could materially reduce the Funds cash available to make distributions on the Funds common stock.

Distributions by the Fund of cash or property in respect of the Funds common stock will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from the Funds current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Any such dividends will be eligible for the dividends-received deduction if received by an otherwise qualifying corporate holder that meets the holding period and other requirements for the dividends-received deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund to certain non-corporate holders of the Funds common stock (including individuals) will be eligible for U.S. federal income taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains for individuals; that the holder receiving the dividend satisfies applicable holding period and other requirements.

If the amount of a Fund distribution exceeds the Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the holders adjusted tax basis in the Funds Common Stock, with any remaining amount taxed as capital gain. Any such capital gain will be long-term capital gain if the holder receiving the distribution has a holding period in the applicable shares of the Funds common stock of more than one (1) year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders of the Funds common stock (including individuals) are generally subject to U.S. federal income taxation at reduced maximum rates.

Upon the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of the Funds common stock, a holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition and the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in the Funds common stock. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holders holding period in the Funds common stock is more than one (1) year at the time of disposition. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders of the Funds common stock (including individuals) are generally subject to U.S. federal income taxation at reduced maximum rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code.

U.S. Bank National Association will serve as the custodian of the Funds assets pursuant to a custody agreement. Under the custody agreement, the custodian will hold the Funds assets, including assets that the Fund holds through Altaba HK, in compliance with the 1940 Act. U.S. Bank National Association is located at 1555 N. River Center Drive, Suite 302, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53212.

Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will serve as the Funds transfer agent and registrar for the Funds common stock. Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is located at 250 Royall Street, Canton, Massachusetts 02021.

U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC will serve as administrator to the Fund. Pursuant to an administration agreement. U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC is located at 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202.

To the knowledge of Yahoo, based on the stockholders of the Company on April 3, 2017, it is expected that immediately upon completion of the Sale Transaction, no person will beneficially own more than five percent of the voting securities of any class of equity securities of the Fund, except as indicated in the table set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled Beneficial Ownership of Principal Stockholders and Management.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Fund and is expected to render an opinion annually on the financial statements of the Fund.

The Fund will vote proxies relating to its portfolio securities in a manner in which the Fund believes is consistent with the best interest of stockholders. The Fund will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by the Fund. Although the Fund generally will vote against proposals that the Fund expects would have a negative impact on its portfolio securities, the Fund may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.

The Funds proxy voting decisions will be made by the Board. The Board may delegate its authority to make proxy voting decisions to a committee of the Board. To ensure that the Funds vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Fund will require that:

Information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period ended June 30 will be made available on the Funds website at www.altaba.com when available. This information will also be available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

The Fund will adopt a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The code of ethics will apply to the personal investing activities of Interested Directors, officers, and certain employees (Access Persons). Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the codes of ethics are designed to prevent unlawful practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities by Access Persons. Under the code of ethics, Access Persons are permitted to engage in personal securities transactions, but are generally required to pre-clear their personal securities transactions in private investments and initial public offerings, and must report their holdings for monitoring purposes. Access Persons may engage in personal securities transactions in securities that are held by the Fund, including in derivatives on those securities, subject to the limitations of the code of ethics.

The code of ethics of the Fund will be filed with the SEC and subsequently can be reviewed and copied at the SECs Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the operation of the SECs Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. The code of ethics will also be available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs website at www.sec.gov, and copies of the code of ethics may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SECs Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.

Yahoo Operating Business. On July 23, 2016, Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo or the Parent) and Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement (the Original Stock Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which Yahoo has agreed to sell, and Verizon has agreed to purchase (the Sale), all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Yahoo (Yahoo Holdings) and, prior to the sale of Yahoo Holdings, to cause Yahoo Holdings to sell to a foreign subsidiary of Verizon all of the equity interests in a newly formed foreign subsidiary of Yahoo Holdings that will hold certain foreign subsidiaries relating to the Yahoo Operating Business (as defined below) (the Foreign Sale Transaction). Immediately prior to the consummation of the Sale, Yahoo Holdings will own Yahoos operating business. Under the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid to Yahoo by Verizon in connection with the Sale was $4,825,800,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Original Stock Purchase Agreement.

Concurrently with the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, Yahoo entered into a Reorganization Agreement (the Original Reorganization Agreement) with Yahoo Holdings, pursuant to which Yahoo will transfer to Yahoo Holdings prior to the consummation of the Sale all of Yahoos assets and liabilities relating to the Yahoo Operating Business (as defined below), other than specified excluded assets and retained liabilities (the Reorganization).

On February 20, 2017, Yahoo and Verizon entered into an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement amending the Original Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment and, together with the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement), and, concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings entered into an Amendment to Reorganization Agreement amending the Original Reorganization Agreement (the Reorganization Agreement Amendment). Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment and the Reorganization Agreement Amendment, Yahoo, Yahoo Holdings, and Verizon entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the Settlement and Release Agreement).

The Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the consideration to be paid by Verizon to Yahoo in connection with the Sale by $350,000,000 to $4,475,800,000, (ii) provided that certain data security incidents to which Yahoo has been subject will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether certain closing conditions have been satisfied and in determining whether a Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and (iii) provided that the date after which each of Yahoo and Verizon may terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement if the Closing (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) has not occurred has been extended to July 24, 2017.

The Reorganization Agreement Amendment provides, among other things, that Yahoo and Verizon will each be responsible for 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by Yahoo.

Under the terms of the Settlement and Release Agreement, among other things, Verizon released certain claims, subject to certain exceptions, that it (and its affiliates and representatives) may have against Yahoo (or its affiliates and representatives) relating to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by Yahoo.

Upon completion of the Sale, Verizon will also receive for its benefit and that of its current and certain of its future affiliates, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property not core to Yahoos operating business (the Excalibur IP Assets) held by Excalibur IP, LLC, a wholly owned

subsidiary of the Company (Excalibur), that is not being transferred to Yahoo Holdings with the operating business.

The excluded assets include Yahoos cash and marketable securities as of the closing of the Sale, Yahoos shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba Group) and Yahoo Japan Corporation (Yahoo Japan), certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity of Excalibur. The retained liabilities will include the 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 issued by Yahoo in November 2013 (the Convertible Notes), securityholder litigation, certain director and officer indemnification obligations, and, pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement Amendment, 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by Parent. Following the closing of the Sale, the excluded assets and retained liabilities will remain in Parent which will be renamed Altaba Inc. and will become an independent, publicly traded, management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The closing of the Sale is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the approval of the Sale by Parents stockholders, the closing of the Reorganization, and certain other customary closing conditions.

We refer to the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement as the Sale Transaction.

These combined financial statements relate to the operating business of Yahoo which is to be sold to Verizon pursuant to the Sale Transaction, which business we refer to in these combined financial statements as Yahoo Operating Business. These financial statements have been prepared on a combined basis as they represent a portion of the Parents business that was not historically a separate legal entity from the Parent. The combined financial statements have been prepared as if Yahoo Operating Business were a separate legal entity as of the dates and for the periods presented in the combined financial statements and described in these notes. Throughout these notes, references to actions of, or contracts entered into by, Yahoo Operating Business refer to historical actions of, or contracts entered into by, the Parent or one of its subsidiaries that are attributable to Yahoo Operating Business.

Yahoo Operating Business is a guide to digital information discovery, focused on informing, connecting, and entertaining users through its search, communications, and digital content products. By creating highly personalized experiences, Yahoo Operating Business helps users discover the information that matters most to them around the worldon mobile or desktop. Yahoo Operating Business creates value for advertisers with a streamlined, simple advertising technology that leverages Yahoo Operating Business data, content, and technology to connect advertisers with their target audiences. Advertisers can build their businesses through advertising to targeted audiences on Yahoo Operating Business online properties and services (Yahoo Properties) and a distribution network of third party entities (Affiliates) who integrate Yahoo Operating Business advertising offerings into their websites or other offerings (Affiliate sites). Yahoo Operating Business revenue is generated principally from search and display advertising. Yahoo Operating Business manages and measures its business geographically, principally in the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Asia Pacific.

Basis of Presentation. The accompanying combined financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities, operating results, and cash flows of Yahoo Operating Business. The preparation of these combined financial statements includes the use of carve-out accounting procedures wherein only assets and liabilities that are specifically attributable to Yahoo Operating Business have been identified and attributed to Yahoo Operating Business, and all costs directly related to Yahoo Operating Business have been allocated to Yahoo Operating Business.

Financial statements have not historically been prepared for Yahoo Operating Business as it has not operated as a separate business. The accompanying combined financial statements include certain assets and liabilities that

have historically been held at the Yahoo corporate level but are specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to Yahoo Operating Business. Cash and cash equivalents held by Yahoo were not attributed to Yahoo Operating Business unless they were held in a legal entity that was dedicated to Yahoo Operating Business for the periods presented. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Net parent company investment is impacted by contributions from and distributions to Yahoo which are the result of treasury activities and net funding distributed to or provided by Yahoo. The other components impacting the net parent company investment are corporate cost allocations and income tax related transfers.

The combined financial statements of Yahoo Operating Business include all Parent expenses for certain functions, including general corporate expenses related to information technology, finance, legal, human resources, internal audit, treasury, tax, investor relations, and executive oversight except for certain costs related to management of the excluded assets, which have been excluded from Yahoo Operating Business operations. Management considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. However, the financial information presented in these combined financial statements may not reflect the combined financial position, operating results, and cash flows of Yahoo Operating Business had Yahoo Operating Business been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented. The accompanying combined financial statements have been derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of Yahoo. These combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America (U.S.). These principles require management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Yahoo Operating Business evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue, the useful lives of long-lived assets including property and equipment and intangible assets, originally developed content, acquired content, stock-based compensation, goodwill, income taxes, contingencies, and restructuring charges. Yahoo Operating Business bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The income tax amounts in these combined financial statements have been calculated based on a separate income tax return methodology and presented as if Yahoo Operating Business operations were separate taxpayers in the applicable jurisdictions.

Yahoo Operating Business maintains various share-based compensation plans. Yahoo Operating Business employees participate in those programs and a portion of the cost of those plans is included in Yahoo Operating Business combined financial statements. See Note 9Employee Benefits for further description of the accounting for share-based compensation plans.

The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared in connection with the Sale Transaction to demonstrate the historical results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Yahoo Operating Business for the indicated periods under Yahoos management.

Concentration of Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Yahoo Operating Business to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments.

Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. Yahoo Operating Business performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses.

Yahoo Operating Business derivative instruments expose Yahoo Operating Business to credit risk to the extent that its derivative counterparties become unable to meet their financial obligations under the terms of the agreements. Yahoo Operating Business seeks to mitigate this risk by limiting its derivative counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions. In addition, the

potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. See Note 7Foreign Currency Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information related to Yahoo Operating Business derivative instruments.

Revenue under the Search and Advertising Sales Agreement (as amended, the Microsoft Search Agreement) with Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) represented approximately 35 percent and 37 percent of Yahoo Operating Business revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and no other individual customer accounted for 10 percent or more of Yahoo Operating Business revenue for 2015 or 2016. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, no one customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the accounts receivable balance.

Comprehensive Loss. Comprehensive loss consists of two components, net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of Yahoo Operating Business equity but are excluded from net loss. Yahoo Operating Business other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges.

Foreign Currency. The functional currency of Yahoo Operating Business international subsidiaries is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and is often the local currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, historical rates of exchange for equity, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenue and expenses. Translation gains (losses) are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of Yahoo Operating Business equity. Yahoo Operating Business records foreign currency transaction gains and losses, realized and unrealized and foreign exchange gains and losses due to re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies in other (expense) income, net in the combined statements of operations. Yahoo Operating Business recorded a $22 million net loss in 2015 and a $4 million net gain in 2016.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. Yahoo Operating Business invests its excess cash in time deposits at high-credit corporate issuers which are classified as cash equivalents. All time deposits with an original maturity of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Yahoo Operating Business records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. Yahoo Operating Business considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay to determine the level of allowance required.

Foreign Currency Derivative Financial Instruments. Yahoo Operating Business uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, to mitigate certain foreign currency exposures.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these forward contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on Yahoo Operating Business combined balance sheets and reclassified into revenue in the combined statements of operations when the underlying hedged revenue is recognized. If the cash flow hedges were to become ineffective, the ineffective portion would be immediately recorded in other (expense) income, net in Yahoo Operating Business combined statements of operations.

Yahoo Operating Business hedges certain of its net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that its earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These balance sheet hedges are used to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other (expense) income, net in Yahoo Operating Business combined statements of operations. The fair values of the balance sheet hedges are determined using quoted observable inputs.

Yahoo Operating Business recognizes all derivative instruments as other assets or liabilities on Yahoo Operating Business combined balance sheets at fair value. See Note 7Foreign Currency Derivative Financial Instruments for a full description of Yahoo Operating Business derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting.

Property and Equipment. Buildings are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 20 to 25 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their expected useful lives and the remaining lease term. Computers and equipment and furniture and fixtures are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years.

Property and equipment to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. No impairments of such assets were identified during any of the periods presented.

Capitalized Software and Labor. Yahoo Operating Business capitalized certain software and labor costs totaling approximately $31 million and $25 million during 2015 and 2016, respectively. Yahoo Operating Business capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage through the development stage. The estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project and ranges from one to three years. Actual economic lives may differ from estimated useful lives. Periodic reviews could result in a change in estimated useful lives and therefore amortization expense in future periods. During 2015 and 2016, the amortization of capitalized costs totaled approximately $144 million and $85 million, respectively. Capitalized software and labor costs are included in property and equipment, net. Included in the capitalized amounts above are $5 million and $4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.

Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Yahoo Operating Business reporting units are at or one level below the operating segments level. The reporting units carrying value is compared to its fair value. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using either the market approach, income approach, or a combination of the market and income approach. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The income approach uses expected future operating results and failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value. The implied fair value is calculated by allocating all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied estimated fair value. Yahoo Operating Business conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31. See Note 5Goodwill for results of the goodwill impairment test.

Intangible Assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis over one to seven years as the pattern of use is ratable. Yahoo Operating Business reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Intangible assets with indefinite useful

lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If Yahoo Operating Business determines that an intangible asset with an indefinite life is more likely than not impaired, a quantitative test comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset with its carrying amount is performed. Yahoo Operating Business estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets using an income approach. Measurement of any impairment losses on both definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. See Note 6Intangible Assets, Net for additional information.

Originally Developed Content and Acquired Content. Originally developed content and acquired content are both carried at cost. Originally developed content is amortized based on the expected pattern of viewing. Acquired content is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of each programs contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. Marketing and general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.

For originally developed content, Yahoo Operating Business performs regular recoverability assessments on a program-by-program basis. If there are any events or changes in circumstances indicating that Yahoo Operating Business should assess whether the fair value of originally developed content is less than its unamortized costs, Yahoo Operating Business performs a fair value analysis using an expected cash flow approach. The amount by which the unamortized costs of the originally developed content exceed estimated fair value is charged to expense as an asset impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Yahoo Operating Business recorded an asset impairment charge of $16 million related to originally developed content.

For acquired content, Yahoo Operating Business compares the net realizable value on a program-by-program basis with the unamortized cost. The amount by which the unamortized costs of the acquired content exceed net realizable value is charged to expense as an asset impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Yahoo Operating Business recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million related to acquired content, primarily driven by a reduction of forecasted revenues to be generated from advertising on Yahoo Properties.

Leasing. Yahoo Operating Business leases office space and data centers under operating leases and certain data center equipment under capital lease agreements with original lease periods up to 15 years. Assets acquired under capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business expensed $4 million and $3 million of interest related to capital leases, respectively, which approximated the cash payments made for interest. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business had net capital lease obligations included in other short-tem and long-term liabilities on the combined balance sheets of $33 million and $23 million, respectively. Certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays and rent escalation provisions. For purposes of recognizing these lease incentives on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, Yahoo Operating Business uses the date that Yahoo Operating Business has the right to control the asset to begin rent expense. Lease renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the period of straight-line recognition of rent expense.

Yahoo Operating Business establishes assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent Yahoo Operating Business is involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon the right to control the facilities under build-to-suit leases, Yahoo Operating Business assesses whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If Yahoo Operating Business continues to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as finance leases.

Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Yahoo Operating Business records a valuation allowance against particular deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes comprises Yahoo Operating Business current tax liability and change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating Yahoo Operating Business uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. Yahoo Operating Business establishes liabilities for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities are established when Yahoo Operating Business believes that certain positions might be challenged despite its belief that its tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws. Yahoo Operating Business adjusts these liabilities when new information becomes available, such as the closing of a tax audit, new tax legislation, developments in case law, or interactions with the tax authorities. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of changes to liabilities for tax-related uncertainties that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were $37 million and $24 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, if Yahoo Operating Business were to file a tax return on separate tax return basis. See Note 11Income Taxes for additional information.

Revenue Recognition. Revenue is generated from offerings, which include clicks on text-based links to advertisers websites that appear primarily on search results pages (search advertising), the display of graphical, non-graphical, and video advertisements (display advertising), and other sources.

Search Revenue. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes revenue from search advertising on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites. Search revenue is recognized based on Paid Clicks. A Paid Click occurs when an end-user clicks on a sponsored listing on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites for which an advertiser pays on a per click basis. Yahoo Operating Business also sells search traffic to certain customers where it does not have a direct relationship with the advertiser, in which case revenue is also recognized based on Paid Clicks. In the Microsoft Search Agreement, Yahoo Operating Business agreed to request paid search results from Microsoft for 51 percent of search queries originating from desktop computers accessing Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites (the Volume Commitment). There is no such Volume Commitment for traffic generated on mobile devices.

On April 15, 2015, the Parent and Microsoft entered into the Eleventh Amendment (the Eleventh Amendment) to the Microsoft Search Agreement. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, Yahoo Operating Business completed the transition of its exclusive sales responsibilities to Microsoft for Microsofts paid search services to premium advertisers in the United States, Canada, and Europe on April 1, 2016 and in its remaining markets (other than Taiwan and Hong Kong) on June 1, 2016. Following the transition in each respective market, Yahoo Operating Business is considered the principal in the sale of traffic to Microsoft and other customers because Yahoo Operating Business is the primary obligor in its arrangements with Microsoft and has discretion in how search queries from Affiliate sites will be fulfilled and monetized. As a result, amounts paid to Affiliates under the Microsoft Search Agreement in the transitioned markets are recorded as cost of revenuetraffic acquisition costs (TAC) rather than as a reduction to revenue, resulting in revenue from the Microsoft Search Agreement being reported on a gross rather than net basis. Effective June 3, 2016, Yahoo and Microsoft further amended the Microsoft Search Agreement to provide that sales responsibilities for premium advertisers in Taiwan and Hong Kong will not be transitioned. TAC in those markets will continue to be reported as a reduction to revenue.

The table below presents how Yahoo Operating Business accounted for amounts paid to Affiliates related to the Microsoft Search Agreement in transitioned markets, and shows the impact of the implementation of the Eleventh Amendment in transitioned markets (in thousands):

See Note 14Microsoft Search Agreement for a description of the Microsoft Search Agreement.

Prior to the Eleventh Amendment, Yahoo Operating Business was entitled to receive a percentage of the revenue (the Revenue Share Rate) generated from Microsofts services on Yahoo Properties and on Affiliate sites after deduction of the Affiliate sites share of revenue and certain Microsoft costs. The Revenue Share Rate was 88 percent for the first five years of the Microsoft Search Agreement and then increased to 90 percent on February 23, 2015. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, the Revenue Share Rate increased to 93 percent, but Microsoft now receives its 7 percent revenue share before deduction of the Affiliate sites share of revenue . The Yahoo Operating Business is responsible for paying the Affiliate for the Affiliate sites share of revenue.

Yahoo Operating Business also recognizes search revenue generated from mobile and desktop ads served through Yahoo Gemini (Yahoo Operating Business unified marketplace for search and native advertising on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites). Yahoo Operating Business is considered the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the search advertising service. Accordingly, the search revenue generated from mobile and desktop ads served through Yahoo Gemini that involve traffic supplied by Affiliates is reported gross of the TAC paid to Affiliates (reported as cost of revenueTAC) as Yahoo Operating Business performs the search service for advertisers.

In October 2015, Yahoo reached an agreement with Google Inc. (Google) that provides Yahoo with additional flexibility to choose among suppliers of search results and ads. Googles offerings complement the search services provided by Microsoft and Yahoo Gemini. Yahoo Operating Business is considered the principal in the sale of traffic to Google because Yahoo Operating Business is the primary obligor in its arrangement with Google and has discretion in how search queries from Affiliate sites will be fulfilled and monetized. As a result, amounts paid to Affiliates under the Google agreement are recorded as cost of revenueTAC. Additionally, Yahoo Operating Business generates search revenue from a revenue sharing arrangement with Yahoo Japan for search technology and services and records the related revenue as reported.

Display Revenue. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes revenue from display advertising on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites as impressions of or clicks on display advertisements, including native ads, are delivered. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears in pages viewed by users. Clicks are delivered when a user clicks on an advertisement. Arrangements for these services generally have terms of up to one year. For display advertising on Affiliate sites, Yahoo Operating Business pays Affiliates from the revenue generated from the display of these advertisements on the Affiliate sites. TAC are payments made to Affiliates and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to Yahoo Properties. The display revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by Affiliates is reported gross of the TAC paid to Affiliates (reported as cost of revenueTAC) when Yahoo Operating Business is the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the display advertising service.

From time-to-time, Yahoo Operating Business may offer customized display advertising solutions to advertisers. These customized display advertising solutions combine Yahoo Operating Business standard display advertising with customized content, customer insights, and campaign analysis which are separate units of accounting. Due to the unique nature of these products, Yahoo Operating Business may not be able to establish selling prices based on historical stand-alone sales or third-party evidence; therefore, Yahoo Operating Business may use its best estimate to establish selling prices. Yahoo Operating Business establishes best estimates within a range of selling prices considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, class of advertiser, size of transaction, seasonality, margin objectives, observed pricing trends, available online inventory, industry pricing strategies, and market conditions. Yahoo Operating Business believes the use of the best estimates of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction.

Other Revenue. Other revenue includes listings-based services revenue, e-commerce, transaction revenue, royalties, patent licenses, and fees revenue. Listings-based services revenue is generated from a variety of consumer and business listings-based services, including classified advertising such as Yahoo Local and other

services. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes listings-based services revenue when the services are performed. Transaction revenue is generated from facilitating commercial transactions through Yahoo Properties, principally from Yahoo Small Business, Yahoo Travel, and Yahoo Shopping. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes transaction revenue when there is evidence that qualifying transactions have occurred. The revenue streams associated with Yahoo Japan and Alibaba Group are considered operational in nature as they relate to licenses of intellectual property that are associated with the core operating business. As such, these amounts are reflected as a part of Yahoo Operating Business condensed combined statements of operations. Yahoo Operating Business receives royalties from Yahoo Japan which are recognized when earned. Yahoo Operating Business recorded revenue from Yahoo Japan of $228 million and $257 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business had net receivable balances from Yahoo Japan of approximately $37 million and $46 million, respectively. Alibaba Groups obligation to make royalty payments under the Technology and Intellectual Property License Agreement (the TIPLA) ceased on September 24, 2014 as a result of the Alibaba Groups initial public offering (the Alibaba Group IPO) of American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and Yahoo Operating Business recognition of the remaining TIPLA deferred revenue was completed on September 18, 2015. Yahoo Operating Business recognized approximately $199 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the TIPLA. Fees revenue consists of revenue generated from a variety of consumer and business fee-based services as well as services for small businesses. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes fees revenue when the services are performed.

In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured. Yahoo Operating Business arrangements generally do not include a provision for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact revenue recognition.

Yahoo Operating Business accounts for cash consideration given to customers, for which it does not receive a separately identifiable benefit and cannot reasonably estimate fair value, as a reduction to revenue.

Current deferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Long-term deferred revenue includes amounts received for which revenue will not be earned within the next 12 months.

Cost of revenueTAC. TAC consists of payments made to Affiliates and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to Yahoo Properties. TAC is either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as cost of revenue  TAC.

TAC related to the Microsoft Search Agreement was recorded as a reduction to revenue for reporting periods through March 31, 2016. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, TAC related to the Microsoft Search Agreement is recorded as cost of revenueTAC in markets that have completed the transition of exclusive sales responsibilities to Microsoft for paid search services to premium advertisers pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment as described above. See Note 14Microsoft Search Agreement for additional information.

TAC recorded as cost of revenue  TAC also relates to Yahoo Operating Business other offerings. Yahoo Operating Business enters into Affiliate agreements of varying duration that involve TAC. There are generally two economic structures of the Affiliate agreements: fixed payments with or without a guaranteed minimum amount of traffic delivered or variable payments based on a percentage of Yahoo Operating Business revenue or based on a certain metric, such as the number of searches or paid clicks. Yahoo Operating Business expenses TAC under two different methods. Agreements with fixed payments are expensed ratably over the term the fixed payment covers or as the traffic is delivered. Agreements based on a percentage of revenue, number of searches, or other metrics are expensed based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed-upon price or rate.

Yahoo Operating Business also has an agreement to compensate a third party, Mozilla Corporation (Mozilla), to make Yahoo Operating Business the default search provider on certain of Mozillas products in the United States. Yahoo Operating Business records these payments as cost of revenue  TAC.

Cost of revenueother. Cost of revenue-other consists of bandwidth costs, stock-based compensation, content, and other expenses associated with the production and usage of Yahoo Properties, including expense and amortization of developed technology and patents. Cost of revenueother also includes costs for Yahoos technology platforms and infrastructure, including depreciation expense of facilities and other operating costs, directly related to revenue generating activities.

Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization of customer, affiliate, and advertiser-related relationships and tradenames, trademarks, and domain names are classified within amortization of intangibles. Amortization of developed technology and patents is included in cost of revenueother.

Product Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of compensation-related expenses (including stock-based compensation expense) incurred for research and development, the development of, enhancements to, and maintenance and operation of Yahoo Properties, advertising products, technology platforms, and infrastructure. Depreciation expense, third-party technology and development expense, and other operating costs are also included in product development.

Advertising Costs. Costs of advertising are recorded as expense as advertising space or airtime is used. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense totaled approximately $184 million and $135 million for 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Restructuring Charges. Yahoo Operating Business has developed and implemented restructuring initiatives to improve efficiencies across the organization, reduce its cost structure, and/or better align its resources with Yahoo Operating Business product strategy. As a result of these plans, Yahoo Operating Business has recorded restructuring charges comprised principally of employee severance and associated termination costs related to the reduction of its workforce, the consolidation of certain real estate facilities and data centers, losses on subleases, and contract termination costs. Yahoo Operating Business restructuring plans include one-time termination benefits as well as certain contractual termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements. One-time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees, unless employees must provide future service, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable. Contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when the entity terminates the contract in accordance with the contract terms.

These restructuring initiatives require management to make estimates in several areas including: (i) expenses for severance and other employee separation costs; (ii) realizable values of assets made redundant, obsolete, or excessive; and (iii) the ability to generate sublease income and to terminate lease obligations at the estimated amounts.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense. The employees of Yahoo Operating Business participate in various Yahoo Operating Business stock compensation plans in which equity awards were granted to Yahoo Operating Business employees. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognizes compensation costs for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award. Stock-based awards are valued based on the grant date fair value of these awards; Yahoo Operating Business records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally one to four years.

Calculating stock-based compensation expense related to stock options requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock options, stock price volatility, and the pre-vesting

forfeiture rate of stock awards. Yahoo Operating Business estimates the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which Yahoo Operating Business believes are representative of future behavior. Yahoo Operating Business estimates the volatility of its common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on its common stock, with a term of one year or greater. Yahoo Operating Business believes that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on its common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent Yahoo Operating Business best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and Yahoo Operating Business uses different assumptions, Yahoo Operating Business stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, Yahoo Operating Business is required to estimate the expected pre-vesting award forfeiture rate, as well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved, and only recognizes expense for those shares expected to vest. Yahoo Operating Business estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of Yahoo Operating Business stock-based awards that are granted and cancelled before vesting. See Note 9Employee Benefits for additional information.

Yahoo Operating Business uses the with and without approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, Yahoo Operating Business recognizes a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to Yahoo Operating Business have been utilized. When tax deductions from stock-based awards are less than the cumulative book compensation expense, the tax effect of the resulting difference (shortfall) is charged first to additional paid-in capital, to the extent of Yahoo Operating Business pool of windfall tax benefits, with any remainder recognized in income tax expense. Yahoo Operating Business determined that it had a sufficient windfall pool available through the end of 2016 to absorb any shortfalls. In addition, Yahoo Operating Business accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based awards on other tax attributes, such as the research tax credit, through the combined statements of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which finalizes its amendments to the guidance in the new revenue standard on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction. This conclusion impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing which finalizes its amendments to the guidance in the new revenue standard regarding the identification of performance obligations and accounting for the license of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients which finalizes its amendments to the guidance in the new revenue standard on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. The amendments are intended to make the guidance more operable and lead to more consistent application. The amendments have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue recognition standard. The standard is required to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. Yahoo Operating Business has not yet selected the transition method. Yahoo Operating Business will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018. Yahoo Operating Business is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about Yahoo Operating Business ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued on both an interim and annual basis. Management is required to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Yahoo Operating Business ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on Yahoo Operating Business disclosures in the footnotes to its combined financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Yahoo Operating Business is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on Yahoo Operating Business combined financial statements and anticipates the new guidance will significantly impact its combined financial statements given Yahoo Operating Business has a significant number of leases.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as part of its simplification initiative, which involves several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax effects, statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Yahoo Operating Business will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact to Yahoo Operating Business financial statements, but do not expect it to have a material impact.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), a consensus of the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. Yahoo Operating Business is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on Yahoo Operating Business cash flows.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory which amends the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intra-entity transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Yahoo Operating Business is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on Yahoo Operating Business combined financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash which provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included within the cash and cash equivalents balances when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017

with early adoption permitted. Yahoo Operating Business is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on Yahoo Operating Business cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment which eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this ASU an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The ASU also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Yahoo Operating Business is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on Yahoo Operating Business combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The following table sets forth the financial assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

The following table sets forth the financial assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

The amount of cash included in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 was $443 million and $283 million, respectively.

The fair values of Yahoo Operating Business Level 1 financial assets and liabilities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair values of Yahoo Operating Business Level 2 financial assets and liabilities are obtained using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices (e.g., interest rates and yield curves).

Activity between Levels of the Fair Value Hierarchy

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business did not make any transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 assets or liabilities.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

The inputs used to measure the estimated fair value of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs using company-specific information. The valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets is discussed in Note 5Goodwill and Note 6Intangible Assets, Net.

As of both December 31, 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business held approximately $19 million of investments in equity securities of privately-held companies that are accounted for using the cost method.

The following table summarizes acquisitions (including business combinations and asset acquisitions) completed during the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions):

At the completion date of each acquisition, Yahoo Operating Business recorded goodwill where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The majority of the goodwill originating from these acquisitions was subsequently impaired in the fourth quarter of 2015. See Note 5Goodwill for results of the goodwill impairment test.

Polyvore. On September 2, 2015, Yahoo Operating Business acquired Polyvore, Inc. (Polyvore), a social commerce website that lets users across the globe discover and shop for their favorite products in fashion, beauty and home décor.

The total purchase price of approximately $161 million consisted of cash consideration. Under the terms of the agreement, Yahoo Operating Business acquired all of the equity interests (including all outstanding vested options) of Polyvore. Outstanding Polyvore unvested options were assumed and converted into equivalent awards for Yahoo common stock valued at $7 million, which is being recognized by Yahoo Operating Business as stock-based compensation expense as the options vest over periods of up to four years from the date of the acquisition.

Separately, in connection with the acquisition, Yahoo Operating Business is also recognizing stock-based compensation expense of $15 million over a period of four years from the date of the acquisition. This amount is comprised of Yahoo common stock issued to the founders (which had a fair value of $15 million at the acquisition date). As part of the Sale Transaction, the Parent retains the obligation to distribute the Yahoo common stock held in escrow that was issued to the founders, but is subject to forfeiture and will be released over four years from the date of the acquisition provided they remain employees of Yahoo Operating Business (or a successor company).

The allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values was as follows (in thousands):

The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding five years and a weighted average useful life of three years. The purchase price of $161 million exceeded the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired and, as a result of the allocation, Yahoo Operating Business recorded goodwill of $131 million in connection with this transaction. Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. The entire goodwill amount was recorded in the Americas segment.

Other AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, Yahoo Operating Business acquired one other company which was accounted for as a business combination. The total purchase price for this acquisition was $23 million. The purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values was as follows: $5 million to amortizable intangibles; $4 million to net liabilities assumed; and the remainder of $22 million to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. The entire goodwill amount was recorded in the EMEA segment.

Yahoo Operating Business business combinations completed during the year ended December 31, 2015 did not have a material impact on Yahoo Operating Business combined statements of operations, and therefore proforma disclosures have not been presented.

Yahoo Operating Business did not make any acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016.

During 2014, Yahoo Operating Business entered into a patent sale and license agreement for total cash consideration of $460 million. The total consideration was allocated based on the estimated relative fair value of each of the elements of the agreement: $61 million was allocated to the sale of patents (Sold Patents), $135 million to the license to existing patents (Existing Patents) and $264 million to the license of patents developed or acquired in the five years following the date Yahoo Operating Business entered into such agreement (Capture Period Patents).

The amounts allocated to the license of the Existing Patents are being recorded as revenue over the four-year payment period under the license when payments are due. The amounts allocated to the Capture Period Patents are being recorded as revenue over the five-year capture period. Yahoo Operating Business recognized $86 million in revenue related to the Existing Patents and the Capture Period Patents in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.

During 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business sold certain patents and recorded a gain on sale of patents of approximately $11 million and $2 million, respectively.

During 2016, Yahoo Operating Business entered into a purchase agreement to sell certain property located in Santa Clara, California. The total carrying value of the property assets was $126 million, which mostly pertained to the land, and was reported within the Americas segment. The decision to sell this property was largely based upon a general lack of operational need for the land and recent improvements in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area. The sale under the purchase agreement was finalized on June 16, 2016 for total proceeds of $246 million, net of closing costs of $4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business recorded a gain of $120 million, net of closing costs, on the sale of the property assets which is included in gain on sale of patents and land in our combined statements of operations.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually (as of October 31) at the reporting unit level or whenever Yahoo Operating Business identifies certain triggering events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might indicate an interim evaluation is warranted include, among other things, unexpected adverse business conditions, regulatory changes, loss of key personnel and reporting unit and macro-economic factors such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at or one level below Yahoo Operating Business operating segments. Yahoo Operating Business identified U.S. & Canada, Latin America, and Tumblr as the reporting units below the Americas operating segment; EMEA is the reporting unit as well as the operating segment; and Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand, India & Southeast Asia as the reporting units below the Asia Pacific operating segment. These operating segments are the same as Yahoo Operating Business reportable segments.

To test for impairment, Yahoo Operating Business uses the two-step quantitative test.

The first step of the quantitative test involves comparing the estimated fair value of Yahoo Operating Business reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill.

To estimate fair value, the company uses the market approach, income approach, or a combination of the two. Under the market approach, Yahoo Operating Business utilizes publicly-traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value Yahoo Operating Business reporting units.

Under the income approach, Yahoo Operating Business determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Yahoo Operating Business bases cash flow projections for each reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value based on the Perpetuity Growth Model.

For any reporting units, where the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, as determined in step one, Yahoo Operating Business performs step two to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The second step of the quantitative test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value. The implied fair value is calculated by allocating all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.

Interim Test. After recording the goodwill impairment charge for Tumblr during the fourth quarter of 2015, the fair value of the Tumblr reporting unit approximated its carrying value. As such, any significant unfavorable changes in the forecast would result in the fair value being less than the carrying value. During the second quarter of 2016, Yahoo Operating Business determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Tumblr reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Tumblr reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31, 2015 included a decline in the 2016 and beyond forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows.

To test the Tumblr reporting unit for impairment, Yahoo Operating Business used the two-step quantitative test. Consistent with methodology used for the prior years annual goodwill impairment testing, Yahoo Operating Business estimated the fair value of the Tumblr reporting unit using an income approach which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, Yahoo Operating Business determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Tumblr reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Tumblr reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Yahoo Operating Business based its cash flow projections for the Tumblr reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value based on the Perpetuity Growth Model. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the analysis, Yahoo Operating Business concluded that the carrying value of the Tumblr reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The second step of the quantitative test was performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the Tumblr reporting unit to its implied fair value. The step two quantitative test for the Tumblr reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Tumblr reporting unit, and Yahoo Operating Business recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $395 million during the second quarter of 2016.

Annual Test. As of October 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business conducted its annual impairment test and no additional impairment was identified.

The remaining goodwill related to the Tumblr reporting unit as of December 31, 2016 was $124 million, which is included in the Americas operating segment. As of December 31, 2016, there was also goodwill remaining for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia & New Zealand reporting units, which are included in the Asia Pacific operating segment.

In 2015, the estimated fair values of the reporting units for all reporting units identified, except for Tumblr and Latin America, were estimated using a combination of a market approach and an income approach, giving equal weighting to each. This combination is deemed to be the most indicative of the reporting units estimated fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants and is consistent with the methodology used for the goodwill impairment test in prior years. For the Tumblr reporting unit, the fair value was estimated using an income approach which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. For the Latin America reporting unit, the fair value was estimated using the market approach as the income approach yielded negative cash flows and was not deemed to be comparable. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from the most recent annual financial forecast for which the planning process commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015. The estimated fair values of Yahoo Operating Business Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia & New Zealand reporting units exceeded their estimated carrying values and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired. In 2015, the carrying value exceeded the fair value for the following reporting units: U.S. & Canada, Europe, Tumblr and Latin America. Yahoo Operating Business completed an assessment of the implied fair value of these reporting units, which resulted in an impairment of all goodwill for the U.S. & Canada, Europe, and Latin America reporting units and a partial impairment for the Tumblr reporting unit. Yahoo Operating Business recorded goodwill impairment charges of $3,692 million, $531 million, $230 million and $8 million, associated with the U.S. & Canada, Europe, Tumblr, and Latin America reporting units, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The impairments were a result of a combination of factors, including a sustained decrease in Yahoo Operating Business market capitalization in fourth quarter of 2015 and lower estimated projected revenue and profitability in the near term. The lower estimated projected cash flows and higher discount rates were used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit affected by such changes.

The following table summarizes Yahoo Operating Business intangible assets, net (in thousands):

Definite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis, as follows:

Yahoo Operating Business recognized amortization expense for intangible assets of $137 million and $100 million for 2015 and 2016, respectively, including $58 million and $42 million, respectively, included in cost of revenue-other. Based on the current amount of intangibles subject to amortization, the estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding years is as follows: 2017: $76 million; 2018: $55 million; 2019: $30 million; and 2020 and after: $1 million.

Yahoo Operating Business reviews identifiable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If Yahoo Operating Business determines that an intangible asset with an indefinite life is more likely than not impaired, a quantitative test comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset with its carrying amount is performed. Yahoo Operating Business estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets using an income approach. Measurement of any impairment losses on both definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.

As a result of the impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2015, the entire carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets were fully impaired as of December 31, 2015, and Yahoo Operating Business did not purchase any indefinite-lived intangibles during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business only had definite-lived intangible assets.

During the second quarter of 2016, Yahoo Operating Business reviewed its Tumblr asset group for impairment as there were events and changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. As a result, Yahoo Operating Business performed a quantitative test comparing the fair value of the Tumblr long-lived assets with the carrying amounts and recorded a partial impairment charge of $87 million associated with its definite-lived intangible assets, which were included within customer, affiliate, and advertiser related relationships and tradenames, trademarks, and domain names in the Americas segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Yahoo Operating Business reviewed its definite-lived intangible assets for impairment. No impairment was identified for definite-lived intangibles.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Yahoo Operating Business reviewed both definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. No impairment was identified for definite-lived intangibles. For indefinite-lived intangibles, Yahoo Operating Business performed a quantitative test comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets with their carrying amount and recorded an impairment charge of $15 million related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in the EMEA segment. As a result, the entire carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was fully impaired as of December 31, 2015.

Yahoo Operating Business uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to mitigate risk associated with adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Yahoo Operating Business records all derivatives in the combined balance sheets at fair value, with assets included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other long-term assets, and liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities. Yahoo Operating Business accounting treatment for these instruments is based on whether or not the instruments are designated as a hedging instrument. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in revenue on the combined statements of operations when the underlying hedged revenue is recognized. Any ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other (expense) income, net on Yahoo Operating Business combined statements of operations. For balance sheet hedges, changes in the fair value are recorded in other (expense) income, net on Yahoo Operating Business combined statements of operations.

Yahoo Operating Business enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk associated with contracts held by Yahoo Operating Business by permitting net settlement of foreign exchange contracts with the same counterparty, subject to applicable requirements. Yahoo Operating Business presents its derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values on the combined balance sheets. Yahoo Operating Business is not required to pledge, and is not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative transactions.

Cash Flow Hedges. Yahoo Operating Business entered into foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of varying maturities through January 31, 2017. The cash flow hedges were considered to be effective as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. All of the forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges that were settled were reclassified to revenue within fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and Yahoo Operating Business recognized the hedge forecasted revenue related to these contacts as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. These trades were de-designated as of December 31, 2016 and all current outstanding cash flow hedges have been reclassified into revenue during 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, the amounts recorded in other (expense) income, net as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were not material.

Balance Sheet Hedges. Yahoo Operating Business hedges certain of its net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that its earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities, including intercompany transactions, which are denominated in foreign currencies.

Notional amounts of Yahoo Operating Business outstanding derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 (in millions) were as follows:

Foreign currency derivative activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 was as follows (in millions):

Lease Commitments. Yahoo Operating Business leases office space and data centers under operating and capital lease agreements with original lease periods of up to 15 years which expire between 2017 and 2025.

Rent expense for all operating leases was approximately $77 million and $60 million for 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Many of Yahoo Operating Business leases contain one or more of the following options which Yahoo Operating Business can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (i) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate or at a slight discount to the fair market rental rate; (ii) purchase of the property at the then fair market value; or (iii) right of first offer to lease additional space that becomes available.

A summary of gross and net lease commitments as of December 31, 2016 was as follows (in millions):

Affiliate Commitments. Yahoo Operating Business is obligated to make payments, which represent TAC, to its Affiliates. As of December 31, 2016, these commitments totaled $925 million, of which $300 million will be payable in each of 2017, 2018, and 2019, and $25 million will be payable in 2020.

Non-cancelable Obligations. Yahoo Operating Business is obligated to make payments under various non-cancelable arrangements with vendors and other business partners, principally for content, bandwidth, and marketing arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, these commitments totaled $172 million, of which $86 million will be payable in 2017, $55 million will be payable in 2018, $17 million will be payable in 2019, $4 million will be payable in 2020, $3 million will be payable in 2021, and $7 million will be payable thereafter.

Intellectual Property Rights. Yahoo Operating Business is committed to make certain payments under various intellectual property arrangements of up to $12 million through 2023.

Note Payable Obligations. Yahoo Operating Business is obligated to make payments for notes payable related to two buildings in Sunnyvale, California. The estimated timing and amounts of payments totaled $52 million, of which $5 million will be payable each year from 2017 through 2021, and $27 million will be payable thereafter.

Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business had outstanding potential obligations relating to standby letters of credit of $38 million. Standby letters of credit are financial guarantees provided by third parties for ongoing operating liabilities such as leases, utility bills, taxes, and insurance. If any letter of credit is drawn upon by a beneficiary, Yahoo Operating Business is obligated to reimburse the provider of the guarantee. The standby letters of credit generally renew annually.

Other Commitments. In the ordinary course of business, Yahoo Operating Business may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, joint ventures and business partners, purchasers of assets or subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of Yahoo Operating Business breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by Yahoo Operating Business, services to be provided by Yahoo Operating Business, intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties or, with respect to the sale, lease, or assignment of assets, or the sale of a subsidiary, matters related to Yahoo Operating Business conduct of the business and tax matters prior to the sale, lease or assignment. In addition, Yahoo Operating Business has also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. Yahoo Operating Business maintains director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to indemnify its current and former directors and officers, and former directors and officers of acquired companies, in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, Yahoo Operating Business has not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and it has not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in Yahoo Operating Business combined financial statements.

As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business did not have any relationships with uncombined entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Accordingly, Yahoo Operating Business is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if Yahoo Operating Business had such relationships. In addition, Yahoo Operating Business identified no variable interests currently held in entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.

Patent Matters. From time to time, third parties assert patent infringement claims against Yahoo Operating Business. Currently, Yahoo Operating Business is engaged in lawsuits regarding patent issues and has been notified of other potential patent disputes.

TCPA Litigation Concerning Yahoo Messenger. On March 21, 2014 and April 16, 2014, civil complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by plaintiffs Rachel Johnson and Zenaida Calderin, respectively, against Yahoo, alleging that the process by which Yahoo Messenger sends a notification SMS message in addition to delivering a users instant message to a recipients cellular telephone constitutes a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. § 227. The penalty per violation ranges from $500 to $1,500. The complaints, which were consolidated, seek statutory damages for a purported class of plaintiffs. In January 2016, the District Court denied class certification treatment proposed by plaintiff Calderin, who accepted a $1,500 offer of judgment to resolve her case in its entirety. The District Court certified a class proposed by plaintiff Johnson comprising more than 300,000 potential members. Yahoo sought permission from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to appeal the District Courts certification order, which the Court of Appeals denied. On March 1, 2017, Yahoo filed a motion for decertification of the class. No decision has been made on the merits of plaintiffs claims, which Yahoo is defending vigorously. Yahoo also previously defended related litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, which denied class certification in September 2015; that case was dismissed with prejudice in March 2016.

General. Yahoo Operating Business is regularly involved in claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of Yahoo Operating Business business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, privacy, consumer protection, information security, data protection or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, as well as actions involving content generated by users, stockholder derivative actions, purported class action lawsuits, and other matters.

Yahoo has determined, based on current knowledge, that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses, including reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts already accrued, is not reasonably estimable with respect to certain matters described above. Yahoo has also determined, based on current knowledge, that the aggregate amount or range of losses that are estimable with respect to Yahoo Operating Business legal proceedings, including the matters described above, would not have a material adverse effect on Yahoo Operating Business combined financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts accrued as of December 31, 2016 were not material. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties, and cannot be predicted with certainty. In the event of a determination adverse to Yahoo, its subsidiaries, directors, or officers in these matters, Yahoo Operating Business may incur substantial monetary liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on Yahoo Operating Business combined financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Yahoo Operating Business may also incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against these claims.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that a copy of certain user account information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoo Operating Business network in late 2014 (the 2014 Security Incident). On December 14, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that, based on its outside forensic experts analysis of data files provided to Yahoo in November 2016 by law enforcement, Yahoo believes an unauthorized third party stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August 2013 (the 2013 Security Incident). In November and December 2016, Yahoo disclosed that based on an investigation by its outside forensic experts, it believes an unauthorized third party accessed Yahoo Operating Business proprietary code to learn how to forge certain cookies. The outside forensic experts have identified approximately 32 million user accounts for which they believe forged cookies were used or taken in 2015 and 2016 (the Cookie Forging Activity). The 2013 Security Incident, the 2014 Security Incident, and the Cookie Forging Activity are collectively referred to herein as the Security Incidents.

As of April 20, 2017, approximately 43 putative consumer class action lawsuits had been filed against Yahoo in U.S. federal and state courts, and in foreign courts, relating to the Security Incidents, one of which was voluntarily dismissed. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of users, generally claim to have been harmed by Yahoos alleged actions and/or omissions in connection with the Security Incidents and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages or other related relief.

Additional lawsuits and claims related to the Security Incidents may be asserted by or on behalf of users, partners, or others seeking damages or other related relief.

Following the consummation of the Sale, pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, Yahoo Operating Business will be responsible for 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related to the Security Incidents. The Parent will be responsible for 100 percent of any such liabilities that are finally determined and entered or stipulated against the Parent or any of its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Sale.

While a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, Yahoo cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses related to these legal proceedings at this time because the legal proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. Based on current information, Yahoo does not believe that a loss from these matters is probable and therefore has not recorded an accrual for litigation or other contingencies relating to the Security Incidents. Yahoo will continue to evaluate information as it

becomes known and will record an accrual for estimated losses at the time or times it is determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.

Benefit Plans. Yahoo Operating Business full-time employees in the U.S. participated in the Yahoo! Inc. 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan) The 401(k) Plan allows employees of Yahoo Operating Business to contribute up to the Internal Revenue Code prescribed maximum amount. Employees may elect to contribute from 1 to 100 percent of their annual compensation to the 401(k) Plan. Yahoo Operating Business matches employee contributions at a rate of 25 percent, up to the IRS prescribed amount. Both employee and employer contributions vest immediately upon contribution. During 2015 and 2016, Yahoo Operating Business contributions to the 401(k) Plan amounted to approximately $21 million and $18 million, respectively. Yahoo Operating Business also contributed approximately $15 million and $12 million to its other defined contribution retirement benefit plans outside of the U.S. for 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Stock Plans. The employees of Yahoo Operating Business participate in various stock compensation plans in which equity awards were granted to Yahoo Operating Business employees with respect to shares of Yahoo common stock. Yahoo Operating Business records stock-based compensation expense for the equity awards granted to the employees of Yahoo Operating Business. The amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of future performance and do not necessarily reflect the results that Yahoo Operating Business would have experienced as an independent company for the periods presented.

The Stock Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, including executive officers, and consultants. The Stock Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and dividend equivalents.

Options granted under the Stock Plan before May 19, 2005 generally expire 10 years after the grant date, and options granted after May 19, 2005 generally expire seven years after the grant date. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period based on continued employment and vest either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.

The Stock Plan permits the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively referred to as restricted stock awards). The restricted stock award vesting criteria are generally the passing of time, meeting certain performance-based objectives, or a combination of both, and continued employment through the vesting period (which varies but generally does not exceed four years). Restricted stock award grants are generally measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of Yahoos common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense over the corresponding service period.

The Stock Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 784 million shares of which 96 million shares were still available for award grant purposes as of December 31, 2016. Each share of Yahoos common stock issued in settlement of full-value awards (which include all awards other than options and stock appreciation rights) granted on or after June 25, 2009 under the Stock Plan counted as 1.75 shares against the Stock Plans share limit. Each share of Yahoos common stock issued in settlement of full-value awards granted on or after June 25, 2014 under the Stock Plan is counted as 2.5 shares against the Stock Plans share limit.

The Directors Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee directors of Yahoo Operating Business. The Directors Plan provides for the issuance of up to 9 million shares of Yahoos common stock, of which approximately 4 million were still available for award grant purposes as of December 31, 2016. Each share of Yahoos common stock issued in settlement of restricted stock units granted after Yahoos 2006 annual meeting of shareholders under the Directors Plan is counted as 1.75 shares against the Directors Plans share limit.

Options granted under the Directors Plan before May 25, 2006 generally become exercisable, based on continued service as a director, for initial grants to new directors, in equal monthly installments over four years, and for annual grants, with 25 percent of such options vesting on the one year anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining options vesting in equal monthly installments over the remaining 36-month period thereafter. Such options generally expire seven to 10 years after the grant date. Options granted on or after May 25, 2006 become exercisable, based on continued service as a director, in equal quarterly installments over one year. Such options generally expire seven years after the grant date.

Restricted stock units granted under the Directors Plan generally vest in equal quarterly installments over a one-year period following the date of grant and, once vested, are generally payable in an equal number of shares of Yahoos common stock on the earlier of the end of the one-year vesting period or the date the director ceases to be a member of Yahoos Board of Directors (the Board) (subject to any deferral election that may be made by the director).

Non-employee directors are also permitted to elect an award of restricted stock units or a stock option under the Directors Plan in lieu of a cash payment of their quarterly Board retainer and any cash fees for serving on committees of the Board. Such stock options or restricted stock unit awards granted in lieu of cash fees are fully vested on the grant date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. During the first quarter of 2015, Yahoo discontinued the offering of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to the employees of Yahoo Operating Business. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan allowed employees of Yahoo Operating Business to purchase shares of Yahoos common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 percent of their compensation subject to certain Internal Revenue Code limitations. The price of the common stock purchased under the plan after November 2012 was equal to 90 percent of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each three-month offering period or the specified purchase date.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, stock-based compensation expense related to the activity under the plan was $2 million.

Stock Options. Yahoos Stock Plan, the Directors Plan, and stock-based awards assumed through acquisitions (including stock-based commitments related to continued service of acquired employees, such as holdbacks by Yahoo of shares of Yahoo common stock issued to founders of acquired companies in connection with certain of Yahoos acquisitions) are collectively referred to as the Plans. Stock option activity under Yahoos Plans for the year ended December 31, 2016 is summarized as follows (in thousands, except years and per share amounts):

The weighted average grant date fair values of all options granted and assumed in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $20.31. Yahoo did not grant any options in 2016.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the aggregate difference between the closing stock price of Yahoos common stock on December 31, 2016 and the exercise price for in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders if all in-the-money options had been exercised on December 31, 2016.

The total intrinsic values of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 were $53 million and $27 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2016, there was $7 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years.

Cash received from option exercises and purchases of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $18 million.

The total net tax benefit attributable to stock options exercised in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $6 million.

The fair value of option grants, including assumed options from acquisitions, is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity under the Plans for the year ended December 31, 2016 is summarized as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

As of December 31, 2016, there was $497 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years.

The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 was $502 million and $470 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, 14 million shares that were subject to previously granted restricted stock units vested. These vested restricted stock awards were net share settled. Yahoo Operating Business withheld 5 million shares based upon Yahoos closing stock price on the vesting date, to satisfy the Yahoo Operating Business tax withholding obligation relating to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. Yahoo Operating Business then remitted cash to the appropriate taxing authorities.

Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the relevant taxing authorities were $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and are reflected as a financing activity within the combined statements of cash flows. The payments were used for tax withholdings related to the net share settlements of restricted stock units.

In 2015 and 2016, $3 million and $1 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards for options exercised and restricted stock awards that vested in current and prior periods were included as a source of cash flows from financing activities. These excess tax benefits represent the reduction in income taxes otherwise payable during the period, attributable to the actual gross tax benefits in excess of the expected tax benefits for options exercised and restricted stock awards that vested in current and prior periods. Yahoo Operating Business has accumulated excess tax deductions relating to stock options exercised and restricted stock awards that vested prior to January 1, 2006 available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable. To the extent such deductions reduce income taxes payable in the current year, they are reported as financing activities in the combined statements of cash flows.

Performance Options. The financial performance stock options awarded by Yahoo in November 2012 to Ms. Mayer and Mr. Goldman include multiple performance periods. The number of stock options that ultimately

vest for each performance period will range from 0 percent to 100 percent of the target amount for such period stated in each executives award agreement based on Yahoo Operating Business performance relative to goals. The financial performance goals are established at the beginning of each performance period and the portion (or tranche) of the award related to each performance period is treated as a separate grant for accounting purposes. In March 2016, the Compensation Committee established performance goals under these stock options for the 2016 performance year. The 2016 financial performance metrics (and their weightings) under the performance stock options are GAAP revenue (one-third), revenue ex-TAC (one-third), and adjusted EBITDA (one-third). The grant date fair value of the 2016 tranche of the November 2012 financial performance stock options was $13 million, and is being recognized over the twelve-month service period. Yahoo Operating Business began recording stock-based compensation expense for this tranche in March 2016, when the financial performance goals were established.

Performance RSUs. In March 2016, the Compensation Committee approved additional annual financial performance-based RSU awards to Ms. Mayer and other senior officers, and established the 2016 annual performance goals for these awards as well as for the similar performance-based RSUs granted in February 2013, February 2014, and March 2015. The 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 performance-based RSU awards are generally eligible to vest in equal annual target amounts over four years (three years for Ms. Mayer) based on Yahoo Operating Business attainment of annual financial performance goals as well as the executives continued employment through each vesting date. The number of shares that ultimately vest each year will range from 0 percent to 200 percent of the annual target amount, based on Yahoo Operating Business performance. Annual financial performance metrics and goals are established for these RSU awards at the beginning of each year and the tranche of each RSU award related to that years performance goal is treated as a separate annual grant for accounting purposes. The 2016 financial performance metrics (and their weightings) established for the performance RSUs are: GAAP revenue (one-third), revenue ex-TAC (one-third), and adjusted EBITDA (one-third). The grant date fair value of the first tranche of the March 2016 performance RSUs was $10 million, the grant date fair value of the second tranche of the March 2015 performance RSUs was $8 million, the grant date fair value of the third tranche of the February 2014 performance RSUs was $4 million, and the grant date fair value of the fourth tranche of the February 2013 performance RSUs was $8 million. These values are being recognized over the tranches twelve-month service periods. Yahoo Operating Business began recording stock-based compensation expense for these tranches in March 2016, when the financial performance goals were established.

Restructuring charges, net consists of employee severance pay and related costs, accelerations of stock-based compensation expense, facility restructuring costs, contract termination and other non-cash charges associated with the exit of facilities, as well as reversals of restructuring charges arising from changes in estimates.

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, restructuring charges, net was comprised of the following (in thousands):

Although Yahoo Operating Business does not allocate restructuring charges to its segments, the amounts of the restructuring charges relating to each segment are presented below. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, restructuring charges, net consists of the following (in thousands):

Yahoo Operating Business has implemented multiple restructuring plans to reduce its cost structure, align resources with its product strategy and improve efficiency, which have resulted in workforce reductions and the consolidation of certain real estate facilities and data centers.

The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to Yahoo Operating Business plan announced in February 2016 to reduce its workforce by approximately 15 percent by the end of 2016 and exit six offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Milan and Burbank, California, subject to applicable laws and consultation processes, as a part of the strategic plan to simplify Yahoo Operating Business product portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with this action, Yahoo Operating Business incurred pre-tax cash charges of $47 million for severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures, pre-tax cash charges of $17 million related to the consolidation and exit of facilities related to noncancelable lease costs and other related costs, pre-tax non-cash charges of $7 million related to stock-based compensation expense and less than $1 million related to impairment costs.

Yahoo Operating Business restructuring accrual activity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 is summarized as follows (in thousands):

The $43 million restructuring liability as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $3 million for employee severance expenses, which Yahoo Operating Business expects to substantially pay out by the end of second quarter of 2017, and $40 million related to non-cancelable lease costs, which Yahoo Operating Business expects to pay over the terms of the related obligations through the fourth quarter of 2025, less estimated sublease income.

As of December 31, restructuring accruals were included on Yahoo Operating Business combined balance sheets as follows (in thousands):

As of December 31, restructuring accruals by segment consisted of the following (in thousands):

Yahoo Operating Business is included in the Yahoo consolidated group and its U.S. taxable income is included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of Yahoo as well as in returns filed by Yahoo with certain state and local taxing jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries tax returns are filed on a separate company basis. Yahoo Operating Business income tax liability has been computed and presented herein under the separate return method. Under the separate return method, Yahoo Operating Business calculated its tax provision as if it were filing its own separate tax return based on Yahoo Operating Business pre-tax financial results. This can result in perceived inconsistencies between the tax provision of Yahoo Operating Business and the tax provision of the Yahoo consolidated group.

The components of loss before income taxes are as follows (in thousands):

The provision for income taxes is composed of the following (in thousands):

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows (in thousands):

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):

Yahoo Operating Business is included in the Yahoo consolidated group and its U.S. taxable income is included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of Yahoo as well as in returns filed by Yahoo with certain state and local taxing jurisdictions. If Yahoo Operating Business was filing on separate return basis as of December 31, 2016, its federal and California net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes would be approximately $172 million and $158 million, respectively.

Yahoo Operating Business has a valuation allowance of approximately $459 million and $564 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 against certain deferred income tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized in future periods. In evaluating Yahoo Operating Business ability to realize its deferred income tax assets, Yahoo Operating Business considers all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business recorded a valuation allowance against all of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Yahoo Operating Business expects to provide a valuation allowance on future U.S. tax benefits until it can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

As of December 31, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business repatriated cumulative earnings from its wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and recorded a $17 million tax expense (primarily related to $172 million of dividend income recognizable in the U.S. with an associated $67 million U.S. tax credit for foreign income taxes that have been paid on such earnings) related to this repatriation in Yahoo Operating Businesss effect of non-US operations. This is included as part of the total income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016. Yahoo Operating Business also intends to repatriate its future earnings from these foreign subsidiaries.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $484 million as of December 31, 2016, of which up to $297 million would affect Yahoo Operating Business effective tax rate if realized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2015 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands):

The remaining balances are recorded on Yahoo Operating Business combined balance sheets as follows (in thousands):

Yahoo Operating Business gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 increased by $32 million from the recorded balance as of December 31, 2015 primarily related to transfer pricing among entities in different tax jurisdictions. Yahoo Operating Business recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made. During 2015 and 2016, interest and penalties recorded in the combined statements of operations were a charge of $1 million and $4 million, respectively. The amounts of

accrued interest and penalties recorded on the combined balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 were approximately $46 million and $50 million, respectively.

The Parent is in various stages of examination and appeal in connection with its taxes both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Those audits generally span tax years 2005 through 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the Parents 2011 through 2015 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination. Yahoo has appealed the proposed California Franchise Tax Boards adjustments to the 2005 through 2008 returns, but no conclusions have been reached to date. Yahoo Operating Business 2009 through 2010 California tax returns are currently under examination. Yahoo Operating Business 2011 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the California Franchise Tax Board for California tax purposes. While it is difficult to determine when the examinations will be settled or their final outcomes, certain audits in various jurisdictions are expected to be resolved in the foreseeable future. Yahoo Operating Business believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable adverse adjustment to the Parents tax returns and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on its combined financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is reasonably possible that Yahoo Operating Business unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to approximately $20 million in the next twelve months.

Tax authorities from the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo have assessed certain indirect taxes against Yahoo Operating Business Brazilian subsidiary, Yahoo! do Brasil Internet Ltda., related to online advertising services. The assessment is for calendar years 2008 through 2012 and as of December 31, 2016 totals approximately $140 million. Yahoo Operating Business currently believes the assessment is without merit. Yahoo Operating Business believes the risk of loss is remote and has not recorded an accrual for the assessment.

Net parent company investment is primarily impacted by contributions from and distributions to Yahoo which are the result of centrally managed treasury activities and net funding distributed to or provided by Yahoo. The other components impacting the net parent company investment are corporate cost allocations and income tax related transfers.

Revenue from related parties, represented approximately 1 percent of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. Management believes that the terms of the agreements with these related parties are comparable to the terms obtained in arms-length transactions with unrelated similarly situated customers of Yahoo Operating Business.

Yahoo Operating Business continues to manage its business geographically. The primary areas of measurement and decision-making are Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and Asia Pacific. Management relies on an internal reporting process that provides revenue, revenue ex-TAC (which is defined as revenue less cost of revenueTAC), direct costs excluding TAC by segment, and combined loss from operations for making decisions related to the evaluation of the financial performance of, and allocating resources to, the Yahoo Operating Business segments.

The following tables present summarized information by segment (in thousands):

See also Note 5Goodwill and Note 10Restructuring Charges, Net for additional information regarding segments.

The following table presents revenue for groups of similar services (in thousands):

Revenue is attributed to individual countries according to the online property that generated the revenue. No single foreign country accounted for more than 10 percent of Yahoo Operating Business revenue, in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

On December 4, 2009, Yahoo Operating Business entered into the Microsoft Search Agreement. On February 18, 2010, Yahoo Operating Business received regulatory clearance from both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission and on February 23, 2010 the Parent commenced implementation of the Microsoft Search Agreement on a market-by-market basis.

On April 15, 2015, Yahoo Operating Business and Microsoft entered into the Eleventh Amendment, pursuant to which the terms of the Microsoft Search Agreement were amended. Previously under the Microsoft Search Agreement, Microsoft was the exclusive algorithmic and paid search services provider to Yahoo Operating Business on personal computers for Yahoo Properties and for search services provided by Yahoo Operating Business to Affiliate sites. Microsoft was the non-exclusive provider on mobile devices. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, Microsoft will provide such services on a non-exclusive basis for Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites on all devices. Commencing on May 1, 2015, Yahoo Operating Business agreed to the Volume Commitment and displays only Microsofts paid search results on such search result pages.

Prior to the Eleventh Amendment, Yahoo Operating Business was entitled to receive the Revenue Share Rate with respect to revenue generated from paid search results on Yahoo Properties and on Affiliate sites after deduction of the Affiliate sites share of revenue and certain Microsoft costs. The Revenue Share Rate was 88 percent for the first five years of the Microsoft Search Agreement and then increased to 90 percent on February 23, 2015. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, the Revenue Share Rate increased to 93 percent, but Microsoft now receives its 7 percent revenue share before deduction of the Affiliate sites share of revenue. Yahoo Operating Business is responsible for paying the Affiliate for the Affiliate sites share of revenue.

Additionally, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, Yahoo Operating Business has the ability in response to queries on both personal computers and mobile devices to request algorithmic listings only, paid listings only or both algorithmic and paid listings from Microsoft. To the extent Yahoo Operating Business requests algorithmic listings only or requests paid listings but elects not to display such paid listings, Yahoo Operating Business pays Microsoft serving costs but not a revenue share. In other cases and with respect to the Volume Commitment, the Revenue Share Rate applies.

Previously under the Microsoft Search Agreement, Yahoo Operating Business had sales exclusivity for both Yahoo Operating Business and Microsofts premium advertisers. For reporting periods ending December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, TAC related to Yahoo Operating Business Microsoft Search Agreement was recorded as a reduction to revenue. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, Yahoo Operating Business completed the transition of its exclusive sales responsibilities to Microsoft for Microsofts paid search services to premium advertisers in the United States, Canada, and Europe on April 1, 2016 and in its remaining markets (other than Taiwan and Hong Kong) on June 1, 2016. Following the transition in each respective market, Yahoo Operating Business is considered the principal in the sale of traffic to Microsoft and other customers because Yahoo Operating Business is the primary obligor in its arrangements with Microsoft and has discretion in how search queries from Affiliate sites will be fulfilled and monetized. As a result, the amounts paid to Affiliates under the

Microsoft Search Agreement in the transitioned markets are recorded as cost of revenueTAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue, resulting in GAAP revenue from the Microsoft Search Agreement being reported on a gross rather than net basis.

Effective June 3, 2016, Yahoo Operating Business and Microsoft further amended the Microsoft Search Agreement to provide that sales responsibilities for premium advertisers in Taiwan and Hong Kong will not be transitioned. TAC in those markets will continue to be reported as a reduction to revenue.

The term of the Microsoft Search Agreement is 10 years from its commencement date, February 23, 2010, subject to earlier termination as provided in the Microsoft Search Agreement. As of October 1, 2015, either Yahoo Operating Business or Microsoft may terminate the Microsoft Search Agreement by delivering a written notice of termination to the other party. The Microsoft Search Agreement will remain in effect for four months from the date of the termination notice to provide for a transition period; however, Yahoo Operating Business Volume Commitment will not apply in the third and fourth months of this transition period.

Approximately 35 percent and 37 percent of Yahoo Operating Business revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, was attributable to the Microsoft Search Agreement. Commencing in the second quarter of 2016, TAC payments related to the Microsoft Search Agreement for transitioned markets, which previously would have been recorded as a reduction to revenue, began to be recorded as a cost of revenue due to a required change in revenue presentation. During the year ended December 31, 2016, $812 million of GAAP revenue and cost of revenueTAC was due to the change in revenue presentation. See Note 1Yahoo Operating Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on change in revenue presentation.

Yahoo Operating Business uncollected revenue share in connection with the Microsoft Search Agreement was $267 million and $392 million, respectively, which is included in accounts receivable, net, as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

On December 4, 2009, in connection with entering into the Microsoft Search Agreement, Yahoo Operating Business also entered into a License Agreement with Microsoft (as amended, the License Agreement). Under the License Agreement, Microsoft acquired an exclusive 10-year license to Yahoo Operating Business core search technology and has the ability to integrate this technology into its existing Web search platforms. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, the exclusive licenses granted to Microsoft under the License Agreement became non-exclusive. Yahoo Operating Business also agreed pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to license certain sales tools to Microsoft to use solely in connection with Microsofts paid search services pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement.

Expenses with respect to any Intercompany Agreement that is not so terminated shall be taken into account for the determination of any purchase price adjustment under Section 1.04 of the Purchase Agreement. Each Party will take, or cause to be taken, all actions as may be reasonably necessary to effect the foregoing.

(b) If a claim or demand is made against an Indemnitee by any Third Party (a  ) as to which such Indemnitee is, or reasonably expects to be, entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnitee will notify the Indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) after receipt by such Indemnitee of notice of the Third-Party Claim; , that the failure to provide notice of any such Third-Party Claim will not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations except and solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party will have been prejudiced as a result of such failure.

compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Claim). After a notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to control the defense, compromise and settlement of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee will have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise and settlement thereof, at its own expense and, in any event, will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense, compromise and settlement and use its reasonable best efforts to make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses and information in such Indemnitees possession or under such Indemnitees control relating thereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party; , that the Indemnitee shall not be required to disclose any information if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to: (w) contain information that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Indemnitee is competitively sensitive; (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or the protections of the work product doctrine; (y) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or Contract to which any Indemnitee is a party; or (z) expose the Indemnitee to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; , that, in any such case, the Indemnitee shall provide such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such privilege or protections or comply with such Law or Contract or otherwise make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this , in the event that (i) an Indemnifying Party elects not to control the defense, compromise and settlement of a Third-Party Claim, (ii) there exists a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee, (iii) any Third-Party Claim seeks a Governmental Order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnitee, (iv) the Indemnitees exposure to Liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim is reasonably expected to exceed the Indemnifying Partys exposure in respect of such Third-Party Claim taking into account the indemnification obligations hereunder, or (v) the Person making such Third-Party Claim is a Governmental Authority with regulatory authority over the Indemnitee or any of its material Assets, such Indemnitee will be entitled to control the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, with one (1) counsel (and any applicable local counsel) of such Indemnitees choosing (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnitee is conducting the defense against any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitee in such defense and use its reasonable best efforts to make available to the Indemnitee all witnesses and information in such Indemnifying Partys possession or under such Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnitee; , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to disclose any information if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to: (w) contain information that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Indemnifying Party is competitively sensitive; (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or the protections of the work product doctrine; (y) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or Contract to which the Indemnifying Party is a party; or (z) expose the Indemnifying Party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; , that, in any such case, the Indemnifying Party shall provide such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such privilege or protections or comply with such Law or Contract or otherwise make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable.

(f) In the case of a Third-Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement of the Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment, other adverse Governmental Order or non-

monetary relief, or monetary relief for which the Indemnitee is not fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party, to be entered, directly or indirectly, against any Indemnitee, does not unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all Liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Claim or includes an admission of guilt, wrongdoing or misconduct on behalf of the Indemnitee.

(g) Absent fraud by an Indemnifying Party, and other than as provided in , the indemnification provisions of and this will be the sole and exclusive remedy of an Indemnitee for any monetary or compensatory damages or Losses resulting from any breach of this Agreement, and each Indemnitee expressly waives and relinquishes all rights, claims or remedies such Person may have with respect to the foregoing other than under and this against any Indemnifying Party.

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall User Security Liabilities include, or the Parties obligations in respect thereof cover, the Business loss of users or partners, any diminution in the value of or lost revenues or profit of the Business or any other adverse business impact on the Business (other than the payments expressly set forth

in the immediately preceding sentence) resulting from, arising out of or relating to any (x) User Security Matters or any such other Data Breaches or (y) any consent decree or other remedy (or the cost of compliance therewith) imposed on or with respect to the Business resulting from, arising out of or relating to any User Security Matters or any such other Data Breaches.   shall mean any of the matters, facts, events, disclosures, developments and occurrences described in or underlying (i) the press release, issued by Seller on September 22, 2016, entitled An Important Message About Yahoo User Security, (ii) the section of Sellers Quarterly Report on Form for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 entitled Security Incident appearing under the heading Recent Developments in Item 2.

(b) Effective immediately, Section 5.2(c) of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following parenthetical at the end thereof:

(ii) adding the following parenthetical (but subject to the proviso at the end of clause (a) above) immediately following the phrase in each case appearing immediately following clause (b) of Section 7.3 of the Agreement.

(f) Effective immediately, Section 7.4 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new clause (h) at the end thereof, as follows:

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Third-Party Claim in respect of User Security Liabilities shall be controlled by the Company Indemnitees, but Seller shall be entitled to participate therein either (i) with counsel (selected by the Company Indemnitees and of recognized standing and competence) that shall serve as joint counsel for Seller and the Company Indemnitees or (ii) with separate counsel selected by Seller, and, in either case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be included in the User Security Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement, that, in the case of clause (ii), (A) unless such separate counsel is retained by Seller as a result of (1) an actual or potential conflict of interest resulting from such joint representation or the Company Indemnitees control or (2) the counsel selected by the Company Indemnitees otherwise refusing to jointly represent Seller, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel for Seller shall not be included in User Security Liabilities and shall instead be at Sellers sole expense and (B) in the event such separate counsel is retained by Seller as a result of clause (A)(1) or (2) above, the fees and expenses of any such separate counsel for Seller beyond a single firm (plus applicable local counsel) shall not be included in User Security Liabilities and shall instead be at Sellers sole expense. The Company Indemnitees shall not settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(g) Effective immediately, the Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new Schedule 1.4 thereto as set forth on Appendix A to this Amendment.

4. . The Parties acknowledge and agree that any reference in the Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document (or in any other document or instrument referred to in any of the foregoing) to the Agreement shall mean the Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

other than the Excluded Matters, individually or in the aggregate, constitute or would reasonably be expected to constitute, or have contributed to or would reasonably be expected to contribute to, a Business Material Adverse Effect, which Purchaser reserves the right to assert, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Data Breaches other than the Excluded Matters shall not be disregarded for purposes of (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 5.02(a)(iii), 5.02(a)(iv) and 5.02(b) of the Purchase Agreement, as amended by the Amendment to Purchase Agreement, to the obligations of Purchaser thereunder to consummate the Closing and purchase the Shares or (ii) the right of Purchaser to terminate the Purchase Agreement, as amended by the Amendment to Purchase Agreement, pursuant to Section 6.01(d)(i) thereof.

The undersigned, Arthur Chong, hereby certifies that:

1. He is the duly elected and acting Secretary of Altaba Inc., a Delaware corporation.

2. The Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation was originally filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on March 24, 1999 under the name Yahoo! Inc.

3. This Restated Certificate of Incorporation only restates and integrates and does not further amend the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation as heretofore amended or supplemented and there is no discrepancy between those provisions and the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

4. The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation as heretofore amended or supplemented, including the Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock attached hereto as , is hereby restated without further amendments or changes to read in full as follows:

The name of this corporation is Altaba Inc. (the  ).

The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

(A) . The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively,   and  . The total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is Five Billion Ten Million (5,010,000,000) shares, each with a par value of $0.001 per share. Five Billion (5,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock and Ten Million (10,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock.

(B) The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, within the limitations and restrictions stated in this Certificate of Incorporation, to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by a bylaw or amendment thereof duly adopted by the Board of Directors.

In the election of directors, each holder of shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to one vote for each share held. No stockholder will be permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors.

No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation other than at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders, upon due notice and in accordance with the provisions of the Corporations Bylaws.

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

The Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

(A) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same may be amended from time to time, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If any applicable law is hereafter amended to authorize, with the approval of the Corporations stockholders, further reductions in the liability of the Corporations directors for breach of fiduciary duty, then a director of the Corporation shall not be liable for any such breach to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as amended.

(B) To the extent the limitations on liability delineated in paragraph (A) of this Article XI are limited by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  ), the limitations under the Investment Company Act shall govern only those actions taken by directors of the Corporation while the Corporation is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and do not apply to any actions taken by directors of the Corporation when the Corporation is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

(C) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article XI shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

(A) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same may be amended from time to time, the Corporation is also authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) agents (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or other applicable law, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory) and the Investment Company Act with respect to actions for breach of duty to a corporation, its stockholders, and others.

(B) To the extent the rights to indemnification delineated in paragraph (A) of this Article XII are limited by the Investment Company Act, such limitations shall govern only those actions taken by an indemnified person while the Corporation is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and do not apply to any actions taken by an indemnified person when the Corporation is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

(C) Any repeal or modification of any of the foregoing provisions of this Article XII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director, officer, agent or other person existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any such person with respect to, any acts or omissions of such person occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

This Restated Certificate of Incorporation, including the Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock attached hereto as , has been duly adopted by the Corporations Board of Directors in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law

of the State of Delaware

Section 1. . The shares of such series shall be designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such series shall be two million (2,000,000).

(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year (each such date being referred to herein as a  ), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $.01 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Corporation (the  ) since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after March 1, 2001 (the  ) (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock).

(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior

Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one thousand (1,000) votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a default period) which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) directors.

(ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of directors shall be exercised unless the holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2) directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or

stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (C) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.

(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.

(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not

(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;

(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;

(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or

(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.

(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

Section 5. . Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.

(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to $100 per share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the  ). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the  ) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the  ). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.

(C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock,

or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Section 7. . In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Section 8. . The shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.

Section 9. . The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporations Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.

Section 10. . At any time when any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding, neither the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation nor this Certificate of Designation shall be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.

Section 11. . Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holders fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

The Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to Yahoo! Inc. (the Company) of the $4.4758 billion in cash (as adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.01 and 1.04 of the Agreement (as defined below), the Cash Consideration) to be paid to the Company, together with the substitution by the Purchaser of such restricted stock unit awards of the Company as are specified in Section 1.03(b) of the Agreement for restricted stock unit awards with respect to shares of the Purchasers common stock as specified in the Agreement, thereby relieving the Company of its obligations with respect to such substituted restricted stock unit awards (the RSU Substitution and, together with the Cash Consideration, collectively, the Consideration), pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2016 (the Agreement), by and between the Company and Verizon Communications Inc. (the Purchaser), as amended by the Amendment to the Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2017 (the Amendment and together with the Agreement, the Agreement), in connection with the purchase from the Company of all of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Shares) of Yahoo! Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (SaleCo). Concurrently with the execution of the Amendment, the Company, SaleCo and the Purchaser entered into (a) an amendment, dated as of February 20, 2017 (the Reorganization Amendment), to the Reorganization Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2016 (the Reorganization Agreement and as amended, the Reorganization Agreement), and (b) a Settlement and Release Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2017 (the Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, the following will occur:

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, the Purchaser, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the

The Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors

transaction contemplated by the Agreement (the Transaction). We have acted as financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Strategic Review Committee) in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the principal portion of which is payable upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation. We also have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Purchaser and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as joint bookrunner with respect to a public offering by the Purchaser of $400,000,000 of Floating Rate notes due 2019, $1,000,000,000 of 1.375% Notes due 2019, $1,000,000,000 of 1.750% Notes due 2021, $2,250,000,000 of 2.625% Notes due 2026, and $1,500,000,000 of 4.125% Notes due 2046 in July 2016; financial advisor to AOL Inc., a subsidiary of the Purchaser, in connection with its acquisition of Millennial Media in October 2015; as a lead dealer manager with respect to seven private offers to exchange specified series of debt securities of the Purchaser and one of its subsidiaries for new debt securities of the Purchaser and cash in March 2015; as a underwriter with respect to a public offering by the Purchaser of 2.625% Notes due 2031 (aggregate principal amount of 1,000,000,000) in December 2014; as a underwriter with respect to a public offering by the Purchaser of 1.625% Notes due 2024 (aggregate principal amount of 1,400,000,000) in December 2014; as a lead dealer manager and a lead solicitation agent with respect to three cash tender offers on behalf of the Purchaser and certain of its subsidiaries in April 2016; and as a dealer in respect of the Purchasers commercial paper program commencing in 2006. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, the Purchaser, SaleCo and their respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. In addition, Goldman, Sachs & Co., acting as principal, is a counterparty to the Company with respect to convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the Companys sale of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the Convertible Notes) and with respect to issuer written warrant transactions entered into contemporaneously with those note transactions (the Hedge and Warrant Transactions). Pursuant to the terms of the Hedge and Warrant Transactions specified in the confirmations thereof, upon a change of control, fundamental change, sale of assets or certain other events involving the Company (including the Transaction), there could be an adjustment, cancellation or termination of the Hedge and Warrant Transactions in whole or in part. In that case, the terms of such confirmations could require the Company to make a termination or cancellation payment to us. In connection with the Hedge and Warrant Transactions, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in hedging transactions intended to reduce the risk of being party to these transactions.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement, the Amendment, the Reorganization Agreement, the Reorganization Amendment and the Settlement Agreement; the preliminary proxy statement of the Company with respect to the Transaction contemplated by the Agreement filed on Schedule 14A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2016; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on of the Company; and certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; certain historical financial information relating to the Business prepared by the management of the Company; certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Business as of July 22, 2016 prepared by the management of the Company; and

The Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors

certain updated internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Business prepared by the management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the Updated Forecasts). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Business, including regarding their assessment of the potential financial impact of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches (in each case, as defined in the Reorganization Agreement); compared certain financial information for the Business and certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar financial and stock market information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the digital media industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Updated Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and the Strategic Review Committee. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including SaleCo, or the Business and, except for being furnished with appraisals of certain real estate assets of the Company, we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, including its decision to enter into the Amendment, the Reorganization Amendment or the Settlement Agreement, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the Company, as of the date hereof, of the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Company for the Shares, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement, the Reorganization Agreement, the Settlement Agreement or the Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement, the Reorganization Agreement or the Settlement Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including the Reorganization Transactions, the Indenture (as defined in the Agreement), any indemnification or other ongoing obligations of the Company, including in respect of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches or any expenses related thereto, any allocation of the Consideration (including between the Cash Consideration and the RSU Substitution), the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or SaleCo, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Company for all of the Shares, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of the

The Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors

Companys common stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company, SaleCo or the Purchaser or the ability of the Company SaleCo or the Purchaser to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Strategic Review Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with their consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Company for the Shares, together with the RSU Substitution, pursuant to the Agreement, is fair from a financial point of view to the Company.

Very truly yours,

The Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors

Members of the Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Yahoo! Inc. (the Seller) of the consideration to be paid to the Seller in the Transaction (as defined below) with Verizon Communications Inc. (the Acquiror) relating to the Sellers wholly owned subsidiary, Yahoo! Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company). The Seller entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2016 (the Pre-Amendment Agreement), with the Acquiror and we understand that the Seller proposes to enter into an Amendment to the Pre-Amendment Agreement (the Amendment and together with the Pre-Amendment Agreement, the Agreement). Concurrently with the execution of the Amendment, the Seller, the Company and the Acquiror will enter into (i) an amendment (the Reorganization Amendment) to the Reorganization Agreement (the Pre-Amendment Reorganization Agreement as amended, the Reorganization Agreement) as defined in the Agreement and (ii) a Settlement and Release Agreement (the Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, the following will occur (collectively, the Transaction):

We also understand that the Consideration will be subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement based on the value of the Sellers unvested restricted stock units outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the closing of the Transaction and the amounts of the Companys working capital, cash, indebtedness and transaction expenses as set forth in the Agreement (the Purchase Price Adjustments).

In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Pre-Amendment Agreement, a draft, dated February 18, 2017, of the Amendment, the Pre-Amendment Reorganization Agreement, a draft, dated February 18, 2017, of the Reorganization Amendment, and a draft, dated February 18, 2017, of the Settlement Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Business and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Business with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant, and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Sellers common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Seller relating to the Business as of July 22, 2016, (vi) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and

updated forecasts prepared by the management of the Seller relating to the Business; and (vii) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Seller with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Business, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Business, including making inquiries of certain members of the management of the Seller regarding their assessment of the potential financial impact of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches (in each case, as defined in the Reorganization Agreement), and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Seller or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Seller, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or, with the exception of being provided with appraisals of certain real estate assets (which we did not use in giving our opinion), been provided with, any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Seller, the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and updated forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Business to which such analyses or updated forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or updated forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions with, and materials furnished to us by, representatives of the Seller and will be consummated as described in the Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement and that the Amendment, Reorganization Amendment and Settlement Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the drafts thereof furnished to us. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Seller and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis, that the Seller will have no exposure under any indemnification obligations contained within the Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement, including in respect of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches, in any amount material to our analysis, and that the Purchase Price Adjustments will not result in any adjustment to the Consideration that is material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Seller with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Seller, the Company or the Business or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Seller in the Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Seller or the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Seller to engage in the Transaction. We express no opinion as whether the Transaction constitutes a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the Sellers properties and assets to another person for purposes of the Sellers 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the Convertible Notes). Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Seller in the Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee of the Sellers Board of Directors with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Seller for our services, a portion of which was paid upon the delivery of our opinion, dated July 22, 2016, and a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Seller has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Seller and the Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as financial advisor to the Seller in connection with its strategic planning in 2015, acting as financial advisor to the Acquiror in connection with its sale of a portfolio of cellphone towers to American Tower in February, 2015 and acting as joint bookrunner on the Acquirors bond offering in October, 2016. In addition, as we have previously advised the Strategic Review Committee and the Seller, one of our affiliates (x) sold to the Seller convertible note hedge options relating to the Sellers common stock in connection with the Sellers sale of the Convertible Notes (the Note Hedge Options) and (y) purchased from the Seller warrants relating to the Sellers common stock contemporaneously with such sale of the Note Hedge Options (the Warrants, and, together with the Note Hedge Options, the Call Spread). Such affiliate entered into the Call Spread, and is acting thereunder, as principal for its own account and not as an advisor to the Seller. Pursuant to the terms of each of the Note Hedge Options and the Warrants, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change under the Convertible Notes, a fundamental change under the Convertible Notes and/or certain transactions or events involving the Seller, the terms of the Note Hedge Options and/or Warrants may be adjusted and/or one or both of the Note Hedge Options and the Warrants may be terminated, in whole or in part. Upon any termination of the Warrants, the Seller will be required to make a payment or delivery to such affiliate. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Acquiror, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Seller and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Seller or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Cash Consideration to be paid to the Seller in the Transaction, together with the RSU Substitution, is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Seller.

The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided to the Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors of the Seller and the Board of Directors of Seller (in their capacities as such) in connection with and for the purposes of their evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Seller as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information statement mailed to stockholders of the Seller but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.

Very truly yours,

The Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors

Members of the Strategic Review Committee of the Board and of the Board:

We understand that Yahoo! Inc. (the Seller) has entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2016 (the Pre-Amendment Agreement), with Verizon Communications Inc., (the Purchaser) and proposes to enter into an Amendment to the Pre-Amendment Agreement (the Amendment and together with the Pre-Amendment Agreement, the Agreement), pursuant to which the Purchaser will purchase from the Seller all of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Shares) of Yahoo! Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), in exchange for $4.4758 billion in cash (the Cash Consideration) and the substitution by the Purchaser of such restricted stock unit awards of the Seller as are specified in Section 1.03(b) of the Agreement for restricted stock unit awards with respect to shares of the Purchasers common stock as specified in the Agreement, thereby relieving the Seller of its obligations with respect to such substituted restricted stock unit awards (the RSU Substitution and, together with the Cash Consideration, collectively, the Consideration). Concurrently with the execution of the Amendment, the Seller, the Company and Purchaser will enter into (i) an amendment (the Reorganization Amendment) to the Reorganization Agreement (the Pre-Amendment Reorganization Agreement) as defined in the Agreement (as amended, the Reorganization Agreement) and (ii) a Settlement and Release Agreement (the Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, the following will occur (collectively, the Transaction):

We also understand that the Consideration will be subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement based on the value of the Sellers unvested restricted stock units outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the closing of the Transaction and the amounts of the Companys working capital, cash, indebtedness and transaction expenses as set forth in the Agreement (the Purchase Price Adjustments).

The terms and conditions of the Transaction are fully set forth in the Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement.

You have asked us whether, in our opinion, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received in the Transaction by the Seller is fair to the Seller from a financial point of view. In arriving at the opinion set forth below, we have, among other things:

In preparing this opinion, with your consent, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information and all other information discussed with or reviewed by us, without independent verification thereof. For purposes of the opinion delivered by us on July 22, 2016, in connection with the Pre-Amendment Agreement, we were provided by the management of the Seller with forecasts and certain terminal year assumptions relating to the Business as of July 22, 2016, which we were directed to use by the Strategic Review Committee. In connection with preparing this opinion, we were provided by the management of the Seller with updated forecasts and certain terminal year assumptions relating to the Business (collectively, the Updated Projections), which we were directed to use by the Board of Directors. We have assumed with your consent that the Updated Projections and the assumptions underlying the Updated Projections, and all other financial analyses, estimates and forecasts provided to us by the management of the Seller, have been reasonably prepared in accordance with industry practice and represent managements best currently available estimates and judgments as to the business and operations and future financial performance of the Business. We assume no responsibility for and express no opinion as to the Updated Projections, the assumptions upon which they are based or any other financial analyses, estimates and forecasts provided to us by the management of the Seller. We have also assumed that there have been no material changes in the assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Business since the respective dates of the last financial statements made available to us. We have relied on representations and/or projections provided by the management of the Seller regarding taxable income, standalone net operating loss utilization and other tax attributes of the Business. We have further relied with your consent upon the assurances of the management of the Seller that they are not aware of any facts that would make the information and projections provided by them inaccurate, incomplete or misleading.

We have not been asked to undertake, and have not undertaken, an independent verification of any information provided to or reviewed by us, nor have we been furnished with any such verification and we do not assume any

responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets of the Seller or the Company. We did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or the liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Seller, nor, with the exception of being furnished with appraisals of certain real estate assets (which we did not use in preparing this opinion), have we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Seller, the Company or the Purchaser under any applicable laws.

We also have assumed with your consent that the final executed forms of the Amendment, the Reorganization Amendment and the Settlement Agreement will not differ in any material respects from drafts reviewed by us and the consummation of the Transaction will be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement, and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party consents and approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Seller, the Company or the Business or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We have also assumed that the Seller will have no exposure under any indemnification obligations contained in the Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement, including in respect of the User Security Matters and Data Breaches, in any amount material to our analysis, and that the Purchase Price Adjustments will not result in any adjustment to the Consideration that is material to our analysis. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Seller obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors and have relied upon without independent verification the assessment of the Seller and its legal, tax and regulatory advisors with respect to such matters.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not considered the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any other business plan or opportunity that might be available to the Seller, or the effect of any other arrangement in which the Seller might engage, and our opinion does not address the underlying decision by the Seller to engage in the Transaction, including its decision to enter into the Amendment, the Reorganization Amendment or the Settlement Agreement. Our opinion is limited to the fairness as of the date hereof, from a financial point of view, to the Seller of the Consideration to be received by the Seller in the Transaction, and our opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the Transaction, the Agreement, the Reorganization Agreement, the Settlement Agreement or any other agreement or understanding entered into in connection with the Transaction or otherwise. We further express no opinion or view as to the fairness of the Transaction to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Seller or as to the underlying decision by the Seller to engage in the Transaction. We also express no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Sellers or the Companys officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based upon economic, market, monetary, regulatory and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated, and the information made available to us, as of the date hereof. We express no opinion as to whether the Transaction constitutes a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the Sellers properties and assets to another person for purposes of the Sellers 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. We express no opinion as to the prices or trading ranges at which the shares of the Sellers common stock will trade at any time.

This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Seller as to how any such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of PJT Partners in accordance with established procedures.

This opinion is provided to the Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors of the Seller and the Sellers Board of Directors, in their capacities as such, in connection with and for the purposes of their evaluation of the Transaction only and is not a recommendation as to any action the Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors should take with respect to the Transaction or any aspect thereof.

This opinion is not to be quoted, summarized, paraphrased or excerpted, in whole or in part, in any registration statement, prospectus or proxy or information statement, or in any other report, document, release or other written or oral communication prepared, issued or transmitted by the Strategic Review Committee of the Board of Directors or any other committee of the Board of Directors, or the Seller, without our prior consent. However, a copy of this opinion may be included, in its entirety, as an exhibit to any disclosure document the Seller is required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Transaction. Any summary of or reference to this opinion or the analysis performed by us in connection with the rendering of this opinion in such documents shall require our prior written approval.

We are acting as financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee of the Sellers Board of Directors with respect to the Transaction and will receive a fee from the Seller for our services, a portion of which was payable upon the rendering of our opinion, dated July 22, 2016, and a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. We will not receive a fee from the Seller in connection with the delivery of this opinion. In addition, the Seller has agreed to reimburse us for out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of the performance of such services (including the rendering of this opinion).

In the ordinary course of our and our affiliates businesses, we and our affiliates may provide investment banking and other financial services to the Seller or the Purchaser and may receive compensation for the rendering of these services.

We may also in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Seller, the Company, the Purchaser and their respective affiliates for which we may receive compensation.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion, as investment bankers, that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the Seller in the Transaction is fair to the Seller from a financial point of view.

Very truly yours,
