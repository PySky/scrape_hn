The Department of Homeland Security is prepared to ban laptops and other electronics larger than a cellphone in the cabins of all flights from Europe to the U.S., officials said on Wednesday.

In March, the Trump administration announced laptop restrictions on flights originating from 10 airports in countries including the UAE, Qatar and Turkey.

England quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes.

Any expansion of the ban could impact U.S. carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group.

Electronic devices may be searched by customs

Six U.S. and European officials said they expect the Department of Homeland Security to make an announcement but declined to say when, according to Reuters.|||
