The Texas Senate recently passed Senate Bill 6 (SB6), known as the “bathroom bill”, targeting transgender people. The bill requires people to use bathrooms in public schools, government buildings, and public universities based on the sex designated on their birth-certificate. Chef strongly opposes this bill.

Chef is dedicated to providing an inclusive and harassment-free experience for anyone who participates in our events. The Chef Code of Conduct prohibits discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.

Quite simply, we do not tolerate harassment or discrimination in any form.

ChefConf will take place May 22-24 in Austin. We have been following SB6 closely since it was introduced last year. Every venue we have contracted for ChefConf, including the JW Marriott and Stubb’s BBQ, unanimously support gender-neutral bathrooms. While the bill was passed by the Senate, it is not yet a law. After thorough discussion and consideration, we will continue with our plans to host ChefConf 2017 in Austin.

We can assure you that should the bill ever become a law – this year in September or in the future – we will not host any additional Chef events in Texas.

If there are any questions we can answer for you please don’t hesitate to reach out!|||
