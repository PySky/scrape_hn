Microsoft Developer Division Corporate Vice President S. "Soma" Somasegar is leaving Microsoft after a 27-year career at the company.

Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie announced Somasegar's impending departure internally on October 8. Somasegar has decided to leave the company and pursue the next phase of his career, according to Guthrie's note.

Microsoft is working on its transition plan now and is hoping to announce that plan in the next few weeks, a company spokesperson confirmed.

Most recently, Somasegar has been in charge of Microsoft's developer tools and services, including programming languages and runtimes; the Visual Studio line of products and services; and the .Net Framework. Somasegar also was responsible for the Cloud and Enterprise business' Global Development Centers in China, India, and Israel, and was the executive sponsor for these centers for all of Microsoft.

Somasegar has been a champion of Microsoft embracing more open-source processes.

Before leading the Developer Division, Somasegar contributed to eight releases of Windows, according to his biography.

There were some rumors earlier this summer that David Treadwell's move from Windows Engineering to Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise unit might signal that Treadwell would become Microsoft's next Developer Division chief. But Treadwell ended up taking a position as head of Microsoft's Identity team.|||
