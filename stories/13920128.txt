It's so easy to forget where you parked your car, especially on a city street or in a huge mall parking lot, but Google Maps is here to save the day.

The latest beta version of Google Maps for Android (sorry iOS users!) has a few features that'll remind you where you parked your car.

The first feature lets you set your parking location by tapping on the blue location dot, and selecting the "Save your parking" option in the menu the list that pops up. (Note: You need to be signed into Google Maps or the feature won't show up, even if you install the beta.)

Once you've done that, you can then add parking notes (i.e. parking lot floor), set a timer to remind you how long you can park your car for, and even add photos to remind you of the surroundings.

Apple Maps on iOS 10 has a car similar feature to help you find your parked car, but it requires a Bluetooth connection between your iPhone and car. But at least Maps will automatically mark your parked car's location as soon as you leave your car. Maps also lets you add notes and photos to your parked car's location, too.

For now, the handy parked car reminder features for Google Maps are limited to the Android beta version. There's no word on when it'll become a public release or when it'll hit iOS.|||

You know, for when you just can't muster the brain cells to remember where you left it.
