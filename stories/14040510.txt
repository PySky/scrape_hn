Reliance Jio is preparing to enter in to the DTH (Direct to Home) service space, given new leaked images of its set-top box have started to surface online. The new pictures are quite different from the ones leaked earlier, which had revealed a round set-top box. Leaked in February, the images had a Jio-branded remote along with set-top box which had a circular top. The device, which deviates from the standard rectangular design for set-top boxes, looks customised for Jio customers.

However, new leaked images suggest Jio might stick with a rectangular design for its set-top box after all. The pictures show a blue box with Reliance Jio branding on top as well as new set-top box. The device has a number of ports including a standard cable connector, HDMI, USB, as well as audio and video output. There’s also an Ethernet port, which will allow users to connect to a modem to offer broadband.

JioTV is said to offer more than 360 channels, at least 50 of which will be in HD. There will be a seven-day ‘catch up’ option to .

The leaks hint at the fact the services might launch pretty soon in the coming months, starting with Mumbai. To recall, the company had said that its Jio fibre service will offer high-speed Internet at up to 1 Gbps speeds. With Jio fibre, users will be able to stream and play high-definition games with multiple players and buffer 4K videos easily.
