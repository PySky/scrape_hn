The Nigerian vise president (yemi osinbajo) has being relegated to the acting coordinator instead of acting president, the relegation was been announcement by president Mohammad Buhari before he jet out for his medical vacation. The announcement as cause debate among many others Nigerians citizens seeing it as a backslide.Sometimes in January, when the president his not around he handed over to his vice president as a acting president, but this time around the vice president will serve as a coordinate of governmental affairs, which it looks like a demotion to him. Apparently, some notable Nigerians have over-hype the vice president beyond compare.I reason with vice president for not revolting over the post, because the president is the boss to the vice president, he as to be loyal to him and obey his word. Nigerian's are too good in twisting words i don't see anything bad in naming the vice president a general coordinator.I believe the acting president will put his best in moving the country forward he has done that before and is going to repeat the same, he his capable that is why the president don't have a recourse over leaving the vice president behind and travel out for medical check up.|||
