Donald Trump: Has he backed down from underestimating North Korea?

"I Would Be Honored to Meet With N. Korean Dictator – Under the Right Circumstances"- Trump

The American government underestimates and has a certain pride that causes the country more harm than good. They sit and waste their precious time boasting of their guns, ammunition, tanks and military prowess, while the enemy plots. This is the reason the 11 September took them by surprise. That plot could have been prevented.

Over the tension between North Korea and America, like always, Donald Trump started in a very bad way with threats and boasts over the might of the American army. But Kim Jong-Un is not like an African leader America can intimidate, dominate and his country used to test the bio-weapons of Aids and Ebola.

Actually, Kim Jong-Un was the first world leader to confront America after triggering Ebola in West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while like a scared dog with the tail tucked in between its thighs, no African leader was able to question the American government about this medical crime which killed thousands of people in West Africa.

In one of our publications, we warned the American government to be careful when dealing with a man called Kim Jong-Un. This is a man the American government shouldn't underestimate because he is an extremely dangerous man.

We are glad that Trump has planned a new strategy to solve the rift between his country and North Korea because the continuous provocation of North Korea by violating rules and testing nuclear weapons is a clear message to America and the rest of the world that he is ready to fight.|||
