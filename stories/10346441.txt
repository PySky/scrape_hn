The MP 01 is a tool, designed to do a job. It flies in the face of the general trend in mobile phone design, with manufacturers fighting to make their offerings ever thinner. By this logic, the perfect phone would be ‘non-physical’: just pixels floating in the air. The MP 01 combines beautiful design with a reassuring solidity that feels good in the hand.

There are phones available for the price of a burger and chips. The MP 01 is an object of real beauty, both inside and out.

The MP 01 has an elegant monochrome user interface, designed to focus on what matters. No app icons, animations, or special effects. Nice and simple.

Charge your smartphone every night. Charge the MP 01 every now and then.

The MP 01 is made with long-lasting materials, including damage-resistant Gorilla Glass, and is finished in an exclusive, high-specification camera paint. It’s built to last – unlike many products in today’s throwaway culture.|||
