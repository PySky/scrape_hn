I couldn't find anyone to explicitly confirm it, but I think it's very likely. If you look carefully at the image they provide on their website:

You can see that the third menu item is 'Add expiry', which suggests that you have to manually do it. Also, note that almost none of the items in the image are in their original packages, and so they don't have their expiry dates written on them at all.

As an aside, I suspect that detecting expiry dates would be a complicated jobâ€”far more difficult than just getting the user to do it. For a camera to be able to detect the expiry date:

As you can see, it's technically far easier to just have the user enter the date, and if they've already had to align the packaging the correct way, reading the date isn't much more effort.

Maybe in future there will be a standard format to show the use by date... But don't raise your hopes too much!|||
