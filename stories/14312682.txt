Create a list of hashes sorted by id backend by redis (useful to create queues with data).

All functions take either an args Array plus optional callback because operations with redis are asynchronous.

Create new hash in list and return its id.

Atomically removes the set of the list stored at source, and pushes the set to the list stored at destination.|||
