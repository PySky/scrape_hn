Didier Rappaport: No, Happn is about serendipity. In the past when you went to dating websites, you had a lot of profiles and it was too virtual.

We are this kind of very poetic app: we believe that it all starts in real life.

You have a lot of possibilities around you, but you cannot get all of them. So many times you might cross paths with someone who you would love to talk with, but you cannot, because you are too shy, or you are too busy, or the person is with grandma.

Happn offers the possibility to reappropriate these missed connections.

DR: Happn is an app for major cities where there is dense population, and it’s strange to notice that these are exactly the place where it’s very difficult to meet people.

There is this new trend of people trying to protect themselves. They live in a place where there are so many people, and sometimes they are fearful about that.

Also in this new life, people, they work so much. You have twenty-six or twenty seven-year old professionals, who spend so much time in the office.

Happn helps you to communicate with others, but you are protected, because the meeting is a little bit virtual.

No I don’t think so. People who find it easy to go over to people, they will not stop because it now exists in a virtual way.

It’s really a question of each individual. The new mobile tools of the internet are not changing life. They just give new ways to do these things.|||

As dating app Happn celebrates $14m of funding, we ask founder Didier Rappaport if the location-based match-making service is killing serendipity.
