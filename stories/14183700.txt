Hey there, we would like to share the latest Cluvio updates with you.

Let’s dive right in!

Today we are launching support for Google BigQuery, Google CloudSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and Exasol, in addition to the already supported Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, AWS Aurora and MariaDB.

You favourite database not yet supported?

Let us know - it can be the next one.

“Cluvio OnPremise”, a new product that we are launching today, allows you to run your own instance of Cluvio on your cloud account (AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) or completely on-premise. Get in touch to get more information.

Our latest update vastly improves the usability of Cluvio on mobile devices like tablets and phones. The mobile experience for writing SQL and analyzing data is still not for the faint-hearted, but checking your dashboards on the go is quite cool, give it a try!

A new configuration option for our Table chart — value bars provide a quick visual overview of numerical values relative to each other in a column.

Press “Cmd + F” (OSX) or “Ctrl + F” (Win) to open the search in our SQL editor.

Press the keys twice to use “Search + Replace”. Much more powerful than the built-in browser search!
