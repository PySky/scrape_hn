My name is Frank Chen, and I am teaching a seminar at UCLA called CS 88S: Safety in the Cloud - Introduction to Cybersecurity in Spring 2017. This course is an preliminary introduction to the field of cybersecurity. We will study a variety of topics that are important for a regular consumer of technology. This course has great relevance in our current society: cyber attacks and data leaks are becoming more mainstream. A shared belief in the journalism field is that "nothing is more important to democracy than an educated electorate"; the same can be said for education in cybersecurity. It is more important than ever for everyone to be cybersecurity-aware.

This is an online form for anyone not enrolled but interested in following along with the course!

No programming or computer science background is required to understand the material - just excitement for a more cybersecurity-aware society! I'll be sending out weekly emails + resources.|||
