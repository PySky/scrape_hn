This infographic is based on trends and learnings across hundreds of enterprises we've engaged with, spanning Fortune 100 companies evaluating a move to public or private clouds, to high-growth, software-first startups that were born in the cloud. The blue bar at bottom summarizes the costs & benefits a company can expect to incur across these stages.

Our goal is to help executives, managers and teams engage in structured conversation to better understand where on the spectrum they fall, and to prioritize how aggressively they want to evolve their deployment capabilities and methodologies.

For companies looking to move aggressively to the right, we recommend learning more about Spinnaker, and then following our Spinnaker Adoption Playbook.

If you'd like to have Armory help enable Stage 4 software deployments to make your company's ability to deploy software a core competency, just reach out to us using the form below.|||
