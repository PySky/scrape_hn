Tesla to release a pickup truck within next two years, Musk tweets it last week. He also said that there will be a Tesla Semi truck to be unveiled in coming September. Elon already has a plan of selling expensive vehicles like Model S and Roadster which can push the company to provide wide range of vehicles to the customers.

Coming to the truck, Elon described it as a new kind of pickup truck, though the concept was already existing. This could be a success to Tesla as it has a strong following in its home country. It is alleged to be named as, Model Y.

There’s also good news for those customers still hoping to receive their Model 3 pre-orders relatively soon: The final reveal of the production version of the Model 3 is coming in July, Musk said, which would fit with reports of multiple prototypes on the streets around Tesla HQ, and its anticipated shipping timeline, which should see the first units go out to customers by the end of this year.

Musk has said that by offering the Model 3, along with the Model S and Model X premium vehicles, it will be able to offer a future compact SUV and a pickup to cover most of the available market. It is also planning to launch a shuttle-bus kind of vehicle to address other remaining markets. Tesla’s overall goal is to capture most the road transportation market in a sustainable way.
