NNCP (Node to Node copy) is a collection of utilities simplifying secure store-and-forward files and mail exchanging.

See also this page on russian.

This utilities are intended to help build up small size (dozens of nodes) ad-hoc friend-to-friend (F2F) statically routed darknet networks for fire-and-forget secure reliable files, file requests and Internet mail transmission. All packets are integrity checked, end-to-end encrypted, explicitly authenticated by known participants public keys. Onion encryption is applied to relayed packets. Each node acts both as a client and server, can use push and poll behaviour model.

Out-of-box offline sneakernet/floppynet, dead drops and air-gapped computers support. But online TCP daemon with full-duplex resumable data transmission exists.

Look for possible use cases!

NNCP is copylefted free software licenced under GNU GPLv3+. It should work on all POSIX-compatible systems. Easy integration with existing SMTP servers. Single YAML configuration file.

Why create yet another store-and-forward solution when UUCP, FTN and even SMTP exists? Look in comparison section! Simplicity, cryptographic security, sneakernet compatibility and easy integration with current SMTP servers are the reasons.|||
