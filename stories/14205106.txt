Linear Technology's family of charge pumps offers the widest selection of simple and compact inductorless DC/DC converter designs. These converters can be used to step-up, step-down or invert an input voltage. By eliminating the inductor, these switched capacitor converters provided small solution footprint and a simpler design. Furthermore, by incorporating Spread Spectrum technology on-chip, both input and output noise are significantly reduced.|||
