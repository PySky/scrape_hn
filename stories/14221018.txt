Fusion energy and MIT's pathway for accelerated demonstration with high-magnetic field tokamaks



An introduction to the key concepts of producing clean, safe, and carbon-free electricity from magnetic fusion energy. This talk reviews the present state of fusion energy research and then introduce MIT's proposed pathway to use high-field superconducting magnets to achieve fusion energy at smaller unit size, at lower cost, and on a timescale relevant to climate change.|||
