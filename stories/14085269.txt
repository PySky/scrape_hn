Qualcomm Inc. fired back at Apple Inc. in their legal battle, defending its business model and seeking damages from Apple over withheld payments for technology used in iPhones.

Qualcomm QCOM, +1.17%  , whose chips and patents are widely used in smartphones, accused Apple AAPL, +1.40%   of mischaracterizing the chipmaker’s business and encouraging international regulators to attack it.

The filing, which Qualcomm said it made late Monday in a federal court in Southern California, argues that Apple’s iPhone business wouldn’t exist had Qualcomm not developed essential technologies and agreed to license them fairly. The iPhone accounted for three-fourths of Apple’s estimated $84 billion gross profit in its latest fiscal year, according to investment bank CLSA.

Apple’s U.S. suit claimed that Qualcomm abused its monopoly position in cellular chips to impose “onerous, unreasonable and costly” terms on customers and competitors. It also said that Qualcomm charged too much for its patents and refused to sell chips to phone makers that didn’t license its patent portfolio.
