We’re committed to helping you reach more fans and keep them engaged. That’s why we built products like Cards and End Screens , which are mobile-friendly tools that let you poll your audience, link to merchandise, recommend videos, and more.Based on your feedback, we’ve made Cards and End Screens even better over time. You told us you wanted Cards to link to videos within a playlist. So we made it happen. For End Screens, you asked for the ability to import End Screens from other videos and use smart elements. So we incorporated it. We’ll continue to listen to your inputs, as always.As adoption of End Screens and Cards has grown, the use of annotations has decreased by over 70 percent. For this reason, the time has come to discontinue Annotations Editor. Effective starting May 2, you’ll no longer be able to add new or edit existing annotations, only delete them. Existing annotations will continue to show when using a desktop computer. We wanted to give you advanced notice so you can adjust. So why now?If you haven’t already, join the many creators who are using End Screens or Cards . As always, thank you for helping build a better YouTube.|||
