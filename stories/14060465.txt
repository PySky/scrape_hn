VPNs are becoming a major topic of conversation due to the recent removal of ISP privacy protections. There are hundreds of VPN providers out there already, and more are materializing every dayâ€”some for good reasons, and some for bad.

Given that reality, I thought it would be a good idea to assemble a short, curated list of my own. Basically, I took numerous resources like this one, and studied and parsed them down to five recommendations.

In short, you are unlikely to go wrong with any of these.

My current, personal recommendation would be to use Mullvad or IVPN if you want an OpenVPN/TLS option, and Zipline if you want an IPSEC solution.|||
