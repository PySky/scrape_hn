This morning I received an e-mail on my HipChat linked account.

According to Atlassian, they have detected an incident that may have resulted in unauthorized access to my user account information which very well includes the username, email address and hashed password.

They go ahead to mention that there is no evidence for other Atlassian products having been breached. They also claim that they did not detect any unauthorized access to financial data.
