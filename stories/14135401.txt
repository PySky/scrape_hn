OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for testing reinforcement learning algorithms. Gym is fun and powerful, but installation can be a challenge. This post will give you a one-line command to install Gym on any modern Mac, reducing your setup time to minutes.

To get started, open up terminal and run the below command to download and run the setup script:

That’s it! The script will take a few minutes to interactively install Gym and it’s dependencies.

We use Homebrew to install Gym’s system-level dependencies. Homebrew downloads packages to their own folders, and uses symlinks to make the commands available. Here’s a summary of each dependency:

We also install the Xcode Command Line tools, which is needed for compiling certain environments.

Conda (also known by Anaconda or Miniconda) is an alternative to the pip/virtualenv/easy_install toolchain. Conda makes it easy to setup Python 3.5 and by using a Conda environment existing python setups will not be affected.

We install Gym using pip within our Conda environment called ‘p36’. Here are the library dependencies:

We create a ‘GymAgents’ folder in the current directory to place our Python-based agents.

Then we download and run a simple example agent to make sure Gym has been successfully installed. If everything works, you will see a ASCII message like this:

If you run into any challenges with the setup script, let me know via the comment section or preferably Github issues. My goal is to make the script as fast, clear, and enjoyable as possible.

You now should be setup with OpenAI Gym. Read the docs and test your Reinforcement Learning algorithms!|||
