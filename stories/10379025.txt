Carson Says Americans Need Guns To Defend Themselves Against The Government

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson tells CBS’ Face the Nation exactly where it’s at, that Americans need to be armed in case “we have the wrong people in office” or in case that horrific day should ever come that America was to be invaded by a foreign Country.

The armed citizens of The United States Of America are then able to rise up and defend themselves. To help to fight against either a tyrannical Government,  or enemy foreign invaders, whichever the case could be some day?

Ben knows that guns and the Second Amendment are a lifeline that ensures us all of our freedoms .

The American people need to be armed, to help protect our very existence and our way of life as we know it. A disarmed Country is a dead Country in my book.|||
