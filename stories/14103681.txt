Android, though based on Linux and is an open source operating system is still vulnerable to a lot of security threats like malware and password cracking and has a lot more privacy concerns than the iPhones.

Eventhough Smartphone manufacturers like Samsung is continuously working on various new technologies like Facial recognition using the Iris scanner and Google constantly revamping the code to provide top level encryptions, Security is still a major threat and a primary concern for the vast majority of smartphone users, especially Android.

Adding to this concern, a recent study by a team of cyber security experts at the Newcastle University suggests that hackers may crack the 4-digit pins or passwords of your android phone with as less as 5 attempts and with 100% accuracy.

Considering the fact that most android phones allow up to 5 wrong attempts before you enter the correct password by default this does really seem to be a huge security concern.

According to this research, the experts have come to a conclusion that it is possible to deduce a password of an android smartphone based on how the users hold their phones, their tilt patterns using the data from the number of sensors installed on most phones like the gyroscope, accelerometer and the proximity sensor.

Since most websites or apps do not specifically require permissions to access the sensors of your phone, the experts say that it is actually easier to crack down your password and even worse the hackers may even know exactly where you are interacting with your screen.

In some cases, the hackers may insert some malicious code to your phone in some way using which they can get access to every little detail you enter and every web page or app you open on your phone with just monitoring the way you tilt or hold your phone.

The university personnel has also added that they have taken this threat to the notice of Apple, Google, and other large tech companies and they still haven'tÂ received any answer from anyone. Hopefully, this issue comes into light and is solved as soon as possible as it poses a major threat to billions of people's personal data.|||
