Chimicles & Tikellis LLP (C&T) is investigating a potential class action lawsuit against Google relating to reports of early shut off and bootlooping in its Nexus 6P smart phones.

First, consumers are reporting a battery problem in the Nexus 6P that causes the phone to power down when the battery gauge still shows anywhere from 10-60% of battery life remaining. Reports link the issue to Android 7.0, but even those users who have flashed back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow are reporting that the problem still occurs. Although Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, the problem has been given low priority and there is no indication of an incoming fix. Reports indicate that consumers who have attempted to receive warranty service from Huawei – the phone manufacturer – have been turned away, with Huawei telling them the problem is not the phone or the battery, but instead it is a problem with Google’s software.

Other consumers are reporting separate problem in the Nexus 6P, namely that the smart phones are getting stuck in what is referred to as a “bootloop.” A bootloop occurs when a Nexus 6P restarts, the Google logo appears on the screen, and then the phone then restarts again, repeatedly, until the phone runs out of battery. Some users reportedly have even wiped their phone’s memory and reflashed Android, to no avail. Reports indicate that this may suggest and support that the bootlooping is caused by a hardware issue. Consumers report that Google tells consumers to seek warranty coverage from Huawei for this issue, too, and that Huawei is largely unhelpful and often stonewalls attempts to obtain warranty coverage.
