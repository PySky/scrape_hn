We’ve been talking about Windows 10 for over a year now and today we started our next chapter, with new devices designed for Windows 10.

Today I stood on stage in NYC along with members of my team and had the honor of unveiling a new era of Windows 10 devices from Microsoft. We introduced new Surface, Lumia, and Band devices and shared the latest from HoloLens, and Xbox. I’ve been using these devices for months and couldn’t wait to share them with you today.

In just a few short months, it’s been incredible to see more than 110 million devices already running Windows 10. I’m personally humbled and excited to see people around the world loving Windows 10. Thank you for your feedback – the team and I love reading it and using it to help us shape the future of Windows.

We’re seeing a great response from IT professionals, with over 8 million business PCs already running Windows 10.

I’ve also been thrilled to see the response from developers and people enjoying everything our new Windows Store has to offer. With over 1.25 billion visits, developers are seeing the benefits – with developer revenue per download increasing four times since Windows 10 launched. This early activity is attracting new universal Windows apps to Windows 10. Today, we announced Facebook will be building universal Windows apps for Facebook, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger. And, we’re excited to welcome new universal Windows apps for Shazam, Box, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Flipagram, NASCAR, Uber and many, many more.

Our approach to hardware is to create and reinvent categories – like we did with Xbox and Xbox Live, with Surface being the tablet that can replace your laptop, with Lumia and Continuum, with Surface Hub, and of course with HoloLens being the only platform enabling you to mix holograms into your world.

Today, we unveiled a range of new devices, all built to make the most of Windows 10:

– the new, ultimate laptop from Microsoft brings together best in class performance with the versatility of pen and touch.

– the tablet that can replace your laptop just got thinner, lighter and faster.

New Lumia Phones – the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL combine Windows 10 innovation with our most powerful hardware and top-of-the-line imaging to help you be more productive. And the Lumia 550, our most affordable 4G LTE smartphone running Windows 10.

– the new Band can help you live healthier and achieve more with a new curved screen, a barometer, and apps for email, text, running, biking, the gym, and golf.

– designed to help Windows developers mix holograms into their world.

– With an upcoming update bringing Windows 10 to Xbox One, backward compatibility, hot games, all new bundles and the most advanced controller we’ve ever created for Xbox One and Windows 10.

Last month, our device partners built more Windows devices than they ever have before in the history of Windows and since launch, we’ve been excited to see share increases for Windows at retail.

And over the next couple of weeks, we’ll be joining some of our partners around the globe as they unveil their holiday device lineup, with great new devices from Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, LG, Panasonic, Toshiba, and more. Our partners have built some amazing new devices – and we have an exciting few weeks ahead of us as they unveil.

With the depth and breadth of Windows 10 devices coming this holiday and beyond, from low cost budget PCs to premium and elegantly designed high performance hardware, we hope you’ll consider a Windows 10 device from Microsoft or our partners.|||
