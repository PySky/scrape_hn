It was 50 years ago today that Sgt Pepper taught the band to play. Which means it must also have been just under 50 years ago today that Sgt Pepper told the four lads in his band to have another crack at recording his title track: “This time a bit rougher and without the horns … Oh, and lads, maybe add a bit of random chatter at the end, see how that works out?” (I’m paraphrasing there – Pepper himself declined to speak to us for this piece.)

What we’re trying to say is that, to celebrate five decades since the Beatles released their masterpiece, we have an exclusive outtake from the legendary sessions to share with you.

It’s part of the album’s Anniversary Edition – out on 26 May – which features the album newly mixed by Giles Martin and Sam Okell, notes from Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, and a whopping 34 previously unreleased recordings.

Without the horn fanfare in the middle or the audience’s cheers and laughter, this version sounds pretty stripped back – and it features some trippy voices echoing around towards the end (“I feel it, I feel it, oh baby now I feel it … Gotta be free now”). Then there’s a brief conversation between John and Paul about singing technique, and some bits where Paul has run out of breath. It’s safe to say the final version is more of a banger, but this recording offers an intriguing glimpse into the Fabs’ world. Have a listen and let us know your thoughts.|||
