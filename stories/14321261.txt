Tuesday is one of my favorite nights of the week! Monday night I am preparing for the full week ahead and resting from the weekend, and wednesday night is usually my busiest night of the week, full of homework and meetings. So Tuesday night is my mid-week reprieve where I can be intentional about cooking, catch up on my to do list, work on projects, do some reading, or spend quality time with someone in my life. Another reason I love Tuesday, is because taco Tuesday specials are observed in LA far and wide, which means that Tuesday is a great opportunity to save on one of my favorite foods. And because so many people love tacos, it often turns into a group event where I get to spend time with amazing people.

What started out as Taco Tuesday for me slowly metamorphosed into tortilla Tuesday, because I kept wanting to explore new foods and flavors! I went from only getting tacos, to getting a taco salad, a burrito or tostadas! I love the idea of having a weekly theme one night of the week so that I can explore and refine the art of crafting delicious tortilla central dishes. This weekâ€™s shopping list is a collection of some of my favorite dishes that I have gathered from a myriad of talented cooks! Whether you decide to eat them all this week, or whether you make one of these dishes for the next five tuesdays, I hope that you will enjoy them as much as I do!|||
