Keep an eye on specific keywords being posted on Twitter

Ever wondered if you would like to keep an eye on a specific keyword on twitter, eg. "bug bounty" if you would like to be updated with latest bug bounty program updates coming in, or "apt" to keep an eye on upcoming threats with help of data visualization.

Congrats, you have landed safely at the right spot.

This program lets you define a specific keyword and allows you to: 



Options: 

 -h, --help [show this help message and exit]

 -k KEYWORD, --keyword=KEYWORD [What do you want to check, sire?]

 -m MAIL, --mail=MAIL [Give your gmail userid.] 

 -e ELASTDETAILS, --elastdetails=ELASTDETAILS [Details of Elasticsearch instance, eg. ip_address:port]



Note: You can pass comma seperated multiple keywords, in order to monitor all of them. This will work properly for alerts on mail functionality, but elasticsearch will recieve mismanaged dictionary and hence might give hamper your dashboards in Kibana.|||
