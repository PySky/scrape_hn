On December 1, 2010, we started a new law firm, in part because our old firm had too many unnecessary expenses that were cutting into the profitability of our business model. We vowed to keep our expenses as low as possible on items that did not directly serve our customers, concentrating on keeping our overhead low. We found, and decided to try Bill4Time. With one exception, our firm is not full of technically savvy types, but we've found Bill4Time to be very user friendly. We've been able to provide the exact same service to our customers at a fraction of the cost of larger billing systems. We are fairly new to Bill4Time but so far we are very happy.|||
