I was on Quora last week and came across this question: What makes product managers angry?

I had a knee-jerk reaction which I’ll get to in a moment, but the question called to mind some of the things that never failed to irritate me as a PM:

But I’d argue that by far the most irritating thing by far, was whenever I worked on a product the market doesn’t want. The data from our survey (published here) shows that I’m not alone. When we asked product managers what the #1 product management challenge was here’s what we found:

No one sets out to build a product the market doesn’t want – it just kind of happens. A team breaks ground on a project without market validation and starts coding. After a certain amount of development, sunk cost mentality sinks in. Even if the feedback from eventual users isn’t good, iterating on the product is more appealing than throwing in the towel.

The problem is, iterating on a product that wasn’t built to solve a real problem is a lot harder than building the right product in the first place. Because everything slows down.

Not only are you trying to design and build what you should have built in the first place, you’ve also got to keep everything else working. More stuff to QA every release; more code to maintain; more things that can go wrong; more stuff to train the sales team on and write documentation for…the ripple effects of sloppy strategy spread far and wide.

We all can make decisions that turn out to be bad. Mistakes happen, and no one bats 1,000 for their career. Some of that iteration and scrambling is inevitable (we’re in the process of changing things with UserMuse now). Being wrong isn’t what makes most product managers angry – it’s not having a vision of what’s right.
