On the web, there's an overwhelming amount of information about the different presidential candidates, and much of it is scattershot. As a political enthusiast, I often receive requests from friends to give them a quick "TLDR" on the current presidential contenders. Using Airtable, I've created an overview of all of the candidates in a highly condensed form.

The best part of this template is that you can create your own copy of it and change it to your own exact needs (click "Get Started" to do so). Add your own checkbox column to mark whether you'd consider voting for the candidate, or rearrange them to your own liking. Create your own filters to show only candidates that support certain issues. And, as we draw closer to the primaries, you can modify and update the stances and candidacy statuses yourself, like a march madness bracket!

Please note that to edit this template, you must first add it to your Airtable account on desktop. You will then be able to access it on mobile devices!|||
