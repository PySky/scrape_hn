Taking decisive action is easier said than done, we normally would have to get to a stage where we realise the consequences of our in-action on our life before we are pushed to take the necessary course of action to make change.



However, many times when we believe we're taking actions to move or propel us forward, we are actually just rotating on the same axis and not really getting anything done.



In todays post I'll try and highlight the significance of taking action, and in-action, how, when and in what circumstances we need to take action, and the difference between actions that would bring an end result and those actions that keeps us in motion, and yield zero results.
