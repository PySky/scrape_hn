"Can I use" provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.

Yes, the support data on this site is free to use under the CC BY 4.0 license.

Yes, you can enable accessible colors from this link or from the option under Settings. This color scheme will be used again on revisit.

Yes, the raw support data is available on GitHub and is updated regularly.

I try to keep it as current as possible, with new information being usually being processed within a few days. Follow the feed if you'd like keep up with all the changes made.|||
