Our latest European Tech Funding and Exits Report shows that a higher proportion of later-stage rounds made Q1 2017 one of the best quarters on record for European and Israeli tech funding. It was also a particularly strong quarter for VC-backed company exits.

In terms of funding, the quarter was the second best we’ve recorded since we started tracking in 2013, surpassed only by Q1 of 2016, when Spotify raised €1 billion in convertible debt. European and Israeli startups completed 869 funding rounds in Q1 2017, totalling €4.5 billion. Compared to Q4 2016, there was a 3% drop in the number of deals, and a 17.2% increase in investment volume.

While the number of  overall tech M&A deals across Europe increased 5.6% during the first quarter compared to the same period the previous year, very few of the transaction sizes were disclosed.

That led the total reported exit volume to drop by 16.7% to €20 billion during the period, compared to €24 billion during the same quarter of 2016.

The number of transactions involving VC-backed tech companies held steady at 65, but the value of those transactions shot up 358.3% from €3.5 billion in Q1 2016 to €16.2 billion in Q1 2017 – mainly thanks to Israel-based Mobileye’s €13.4 billion acquisition by Intel.

Our newly released European Tech Funding and Exits Report dives deep into these numbers.  It’s the first time we are releasing one combined report that looks both at funding and exit figures in one comprehensive analysis.

The report is the culmination of our ongoing monitoring of 150+ news sources across Europe in 12+ languages – including Israel, Russia, the Balkans, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and other countries we consider part of the European technology industry. These deals are also outlined on a weekly basis in our newsletter.

This is our fourth year producing in-depth reports, and each has proved to be a very valuable resource for corporates, VC and M&A firms, and other prominent actors in Europe’s ecosystem.
