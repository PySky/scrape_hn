This does not require babel to perform transpiling as later version of node have ES6 support natively, however current version of node used here does not support import so require is being used.

Any donations received will be able to assist me provide more blog entries and examples via GitHub, any contributions provided is greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your support.|||
