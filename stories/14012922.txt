I’m excited to announce that Syscoin and its parent company, Blockchain Foundry, have recently launched three blockchain products which are now LIVE on Azure.

Through Syscoin’s API product, developers can create blockchain-enabled applications using Syscoin’s suite of decentralized business services, including digital certificates, secure messaging, marketplace offers, payments and escrow transactions.

Syscoin and Blockchain Foundry are important partners on Azure. We are proud to welcome them to the platform and we look forward to an ongoing partnership with the team.
