A new, much larger variety of chimpanzee was recently discovered in northern Congo in the Bili region. These chimps walk with their back straight and nest on the ground, unlike other chimpanzees. It's claimed they attack and kill large carnivores for food. This has renewed the debate among scientists about genetic variation among the great apes. It began in the 1860s when explorer Paul Du Chaillu described a hybrid species he called the koola-kamba -- a cross between chimpanzee and gorilla.

More recently, scientific uncertainty was renewed when a performing chimpanzee named Oliver was thought to be too close to human to be a mere chimpanzee. His blood was tested by the University of Chicago in 1996 and found to possess the 24 chromosome pairs of a chimpanzee.

Below is a Bili ape captured on video, along with footage of Oliver and a photo of a mysterious primate photographed at the Yaounde zoo in Cameroon which has the eyes of a gorilla and the body of a chimpanzee.

It would seem the great apes exhibit greater variety than was originally believed.  Since they inhabit remote, dense jungles, much remains to be learned. They may hold clues about how humans came to emerge.  (By Paris A. Walker)
