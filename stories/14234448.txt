If you need to schedule power on’s or shut downs and avoid being charged while your virtual machines are not being used on Microsoft’s Azure Cloud, Azure Virtual Machine Scheduler (AVMS) is the tool for you.

AVMS automates scheduled startup and shutdown of Azure Virtual Machines and can perform multiple granular power schedules. Simply select the virtual machines you want to power off or shutdown, create a schedule and AVMS will complete this and notify you via email when the job has started and completed as well as detailing which VMs within Azure you have selected.

Popular uses for AVMS include Development and Test environments, where work loads are not required outside of business hours, normally with a reoccurring schedule so you can forget about doing this manually.

As an example, simply selecting all your Development and Test Azure VMs to be shut down outside of business hours at 6:00 PM, then start up again 6:00 AM. They will be ready for your Developers when they come in to the office in the morning and you wont be getting billed for services you are not using.|||
