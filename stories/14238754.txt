To everyone above:

Making changes to the interface of GitLab is very hard, and very easy to get wrong and we clearly missed the ball here. Without going in needless detail that can be found in the issues linked by others, we didn't consider the importance of two major interface features that we have removed with this change:

Our evaluation for making this change was too short and it seems like we have been biased by our own way of using GitLab.

Our iteration speed is extremely high for a product like ours, but we need to learn to be more careful when making changes to our interface.

On that note, I can't make a quick decision on this feature either, but I want to make it clear that we want to resolve any issues to productivity that this has caused as soon as possible.

Going forward, together with you all, we will be working on bringing back lost functionality (be that be reverting, #29866 (closed) or allowing you to pin the current menu) in the first release we're able to do so.

We will also make changes that prevent us from making a mistake like this less likely. We will document those changes here and elsewhere and they will be described in detail in our handbook.

We like to err on the side of risk, allowing us to quickly react to feedback, but we don't want to upset, confuse or reduce productivity of our users. We want the opposite of that! GitLab should delight you, be easy, obvious to use and boost your productivity with every release.

Our PMs and UX team will continue to be active in this thread, linking how we're moving forward and closing this issue once a path forward has been established. And as always - we'll do this together with you all.|||
