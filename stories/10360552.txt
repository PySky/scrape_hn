DevSnack #10: JS frameworks! The good, the bad, and the ugly. Tie-breaker comparisons for this week’s DevSnack.

JavaScript fundamentalists may argue pure JavaScript is better for a great number of reasons, while most of  the community prefers to delegate the deep-down code to Frameworks and just work on what they call ‘the real problem’.  See for yourself what David Walsh (@davidwalshblog) has to say about it.

Released in March of 2014 and having 83 contributors on GitHub, Mithril is worth to take a look at, as it claims to be the smallest, fastest and easiest JS Framework. Take a look at this post to see how convenient it may be for your purposes, compared to an Angular or React approach.

Robin Ward (@eviltrout), tells us in his blog that Angular is simpler than Ember, but this simplicity comes along with some pitfalls he illustrates with examples. Check it out!

In this article, Paul Yoder (@paulyoder) explains how he found Ember, and why he feels that Angular let him down in some aspects. Not only a technical comparison but also an overview from a more human perspective.

Come along with Uri Shaked (@urishaked), while he contrasts the key features of these frameworks. Things like Backbone’s minimalism, Angular’s innovative approach and Ember’s performance.
