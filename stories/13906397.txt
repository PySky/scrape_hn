This library provides a public domain cross platform lock free thread caching 16-byte aligned memory allocator implemented in C. The latest source code is always available at https://github.com/rampantpixels/rpmalloc

The code should be easily portable to any platform with atomic operations and an mmap-style virtual memory management API.

This library is put in the public domain; you can redistribute it and/or modify it without any restrictions. Or, if you choose, you can use it under the MIT license.

We believe rpmalloc is faster than most popular memory allocators like tcmalloc, hoard, ptmalloc3 and others without causing extra allocated memory overhead in the thread caches. We also believe the implementation to be easier to read and modify compared to these allocators, as it is a single source file of ~1700 lines of C code.

Contained in a parallel repository is a benchmark utility that performs interleaved allocations (both aligned to 8 or 16 bytes, and unaligned) and deallocations (both in-thread and cross-thread) in multiple threads. It measures number of memory operations performed per CPU second, as well as memory overhead by comparing the virtual memory mapped with the number of bytes requested in allocation calls. The setup of number of thread, cross-thread deallocation rate and allocation size limits is configured by command line arguments.

Below is an example performance comparison chart of rpmalloc and other popular allocator implementations, with default configurations used.

The benchmark producing these numbers were run on an Ubuntu 16.10 machine with 8 logical cores (4 physical, HT). The actual numbers are not to be interpreted as absolute performance figures, but rather as relative comparisons between the different allocators. For additional benchmark results, see the BENCHMARKS file.

Configuration of the thread and global caches can be important depending on your use pattern. See CACHE for a case study and some comments/guidelines.

The easiest way to use the library is simply adding rpmalloc.[h|c] to your project and compile them along with your sources. This contains only the rpmalloc specific entry points and does not provide internal hooks to process and/or thread creation at the moment. You are required to call these functions from your own code in order to initialize and finalize the allocator in your process and threads:

rpmalloc_initialize : Call at process start to initialize the allocator

rpmalloc_finalize: Call at process exit to finalize the allocator

rpmalloc_thread_initialize: Call at each thread start to initialize the thread local data for the allocator

rpmalloc_thread_finalize: Call at each thread exit to finalize and release thread cache back to global cache

Then simply use the rpmalloc/rpfree and the other malloc style replacement functions. Remember all allocations are 16-byte aligned, so no need to call the explicit rpmemalign/rpaligned_alloc/rpposix_memalign functions unless you need greater alignment, they are simply wrappers to make it easier to replace in existing code.

If you wish to override the standard library malloc family of functions and have automatic initialization/finalization of process and threads, also include the file in your project. The automatic init/fini is only implemented for Linux and macOS targets.

To compile as a static library run the configure python script which generates a Ninja build script, then build using ninja. Or use the Visual Studio or XCode projects available in the build subdirectories. This also includes the malloc overrides and init/fini glue code.

The configure + ninja build also produces a shared object/dynamic library that can be used with LD_PRELOAD/DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to inject in a preexisting binary, replacing any malloc/free family of function calls. This is only implemented for Linux and macOS targets.

Free memory pages are cached both per thread and in a global cache for all threads. The size of the thread caches is determined by an adaptive scheme where each cache is limited by a percentage of the maximum allocation count of the corresponding size class. The size of the global caches is determined by a multiple of the maximum of all thread caches. The factors controlling the cache sizes can be set by either defining one of four presets, or by editing the individual defines in the source file for fine tuned control. If you do not define any of the following three directives, the default preset will be used which is to increase caches and prioritize performance over memory overhead (but not making caches unlimited).

ENABLE_UNLIMITED_CACHE: This will make all caches infinite, i.e never release spans to global cache unless thread finishes, and never unmap memory pages back to the OS. Highest performance but largest memory overhead.

ENABLE_SPACE_PRIORITY_CACHE: This will reduce caches to minimize memory overhead while still maintaining decent performance.

DISABLE_CACHE: This will completely disable caches for free pages and instead immediately unmap memory pages back to the OS when no longer in use. Minimizes memory overhead but heavily reduces performance.

Detailed statistics are available if ENABLE_STATISTICS is defined to 1 (default is 0, or disabled), either on compile command line or by setting the value in . This will cause a slight overhead in runtime to collect statistics for each memory operation, and will also add 4 bytes overhead per allocation to track sizes.

Integer safety checks on all calls are enabled if ENABLE_VALIDATE_ARGS is defined to 1 (default is 0, or disabled), either on compile command line or by setting the value in . If enabled, size arguments to the global entry points are verified not to cause integer overflows in calculations.

Asserts are enabled if ENABLE_ASSERTS is defined to 1 (default is 0, or disabled), either on compile command line or by setting the value in .

The allocator is similar in spirit to tcmalloc from the Google Performance Toolkit. It uses separate heaps for each thread and partitions memory blocks according to a preconfigured set of size classes, up to 2MiB. Larger blocks are mapped and unmapped directly. Allocations for different size classes will be served from different set of memory pages, each "span" of pages is dedicated to one size class. Spans of pages can flow between threads when the thread cache overflows and are released to a global cache, or when the thread ends. Unlike tcmalloc, single blocks do not flow between threads, only entire spans of pages.

The allocator is based on 64KiB page alignment, where all runs of memory pages are mapped to 64KiB boundaries. On Windows this is automatically guaranteed by the VirtualAlloc granularity, and on mmap systems it is achieved by atomically incrementing the address where pages are mapped to. By aligning to 64KiB boundaries the free operation can locate the header of the memory block without having to do a table lookup (as tcmalloc does) by simply masking out the low 16 bits of the address.

Memory blocks are divided into three categories. Small blocks are [16, 2032] bytes, medium blocks (2032, 32720] bytes, and large blocks (32720, 2097120] bytes. The three categories are further divided in size classes.

Small blocks have a size class granularity of 16 bytes each in 127 buckets. Medium blocks have a granularity of 512 bytes, 60 buckets. Large blocks have a 64KiB granularity, 32 buckets. All allocations are fitted to these size class boundaries (an allocation of 34 bytes will allocate a block of 48 bytes). Each small and medium size class has an associated span (meaning a contiguous set of memory pages) configuration describing how many pages the size class will allocate each time the cache is empty and a new allocation is requested.

Spans for small and medium blocks are cached in four levels to avoid calls to map/unmap memory pages. The first level is a per thread single active span for each size class. The second level is a per thread list of partially free spans for each size class. The third level is a per thread list of free spans for each number of pages in the span configuration. The fourth level is a global list of free spans for each number of pages in the span configuration.

Each span for a small and medium size class keeps track of how many blocks are allocated/free, as well as a list of which blocks that are free for allocation. To avoid locks, each span is completely owned by the allocating thread, and all cross-thread deallocations will be deferred to the owner thread.

Large blocks, or super spans, are cached in two levels. The first level is a per thread list of free super spans. The second level is a global list of free super spans.

There is no memory fragmentation by the allocator in the sense that it will not leave unallocated and unusable "holes" in the memory pages by calls to allocate and free blocks of different sizes. This is due to the fact that the memory pages allocated for each size class is split up in perfectly aligned blocks which are not reused for a request of a different size. The block freed by a call to will always be immediately available for an allocation request within the same size class.

However, there is memory fragmentation in the meaning that a request for x bytes followed by a request of y bytes where x and y are at least one size class different in size will return blocks that are at least one memory page apart in virtual address space. Only blocks of the same size will potentially be within the same memory page span.

Unlike the similar tcmalloc where the linked list of individual blocks leads to back-to-back allocations of the same block size will spread across a different span of memory pages each time (depending on free order), rpmalloc keeps an "active span" for each size class. This leads to back-to-back allocations will most likely be served from within the same span of memory pages (unless the span runs out of free blocks). The rpmalloc implementation will also use any "holes" in memory pages in semi-filled spans before using a completely free span.

Compared to the tcmalloc implementation, rpmalloc does not suffer as much from a producer-consumer thread scenario where one thread allocates memory blocks and another thread frees the blocks. In tcmalloc the free blocks need to traverse both the thread cache of the thread doing the free operations as well as the global cache before being reused in the allocating thread. In rpmalloc the freed blocks will be reused as soon as the allocating thread needs to get new spans from the thread cache.

Threads that keep ownership of allocated memory blocks within the thread and free the blocks from the same thread will have optimal performance.

Threads that have allocation patterns where the difference in memory usage high and low water marks fit within the thread cache thresholds in the allocator will never touch the global cache except during thread init/fini and have optimal performance. Tweaking the cache limits can be done on a per-size-class basis.

Since each thread cache maps spans of memory pages per size class, a thread that allocates just a few blocks of each size class (16, 32, 48, ...) for many size classes will never fill each bucket, and thus map a lot of memory pages while only using a small fraction of the mapped memory. However, the wasted memory will always be less than 64KiB per size class.

An application that has a producer-consumer scheme between threads where one thread performs all allocations and another frees all memory will have a sub-optimal performance due to blocks crossing thread boundaries will be freed in a two step process - first deferred to the allocating thread, then freed when that thread has need for more memory pages for the requested size. However, depending on the use case the performance overhead might be small.

Threads that perform a lot of allocations and deallocations in a pattern that have a large difference in high and low water marks, and that difference is larger than the thread cache size, will put a lot of contention on the global cache. What will happen is the thread cache will overflow on each low water mark causing pages to be released to the global cache, then underflow on high water mark causing pages to be re-aqcuired from the global cache.

Cross-thread deallocations are more costly than in-thread deallocations, since the spans are completely owned by the allocating thread. The free operation will be deferred using an atomic list operation and the actual free operation will be performed when the owner thread requires a new block of the corresponding size class.

VirtualAlloc has an internal granularity of 64KiB. However, mmap lacks this granularity control, and the implementation instead keeps track and atomically increases a running address counter of where memory pages should be mapped to in the virtual address range. If some other code in the process uses mmap to reserve a part of virtual memory spance this counter needs to catch up and resync in order to keep the 64KiB granularity of span addresses, which could potentially be time consuming.

The free, realloc and usable size functions all require the passed pointer to be within the first 64KiB page block of the start of the memory block. You cannot pass in any pointer from the memory block address range.|||
