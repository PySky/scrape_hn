We won’t get to see The Last Jedi until December 2017. Our list will have to do for now…

Because it’s not the internet without cats.

No, it’s not the Mandela Effect (Here’s what a Mandala Effect is if you don’t remember (see what I did there?)). At least we don’t think so.

If you haven’t read TFA Star Wars: C-3PO #1 by James Robinson, Tony Harris, and Joe Caramagna, then you probably don’t know that Threepio wears a mysterious red arm in honor of a droid who sacrificed himself for Threepio’s sake. Seems pretty vanilla, but it signifies a deep, existential conversation within C-3PO’s robot soul. Why do droids choose a side at all? How do they conceive of sacrifice?

Note: But this could just be a part of the random parts conspiracy, where Threepio is a savvy scavenger constantly updating himself with parts that “work.”



Especially if it’s one of Leia’s famous Bilbringi pies (which are stuffed with meat, cheese, and pepper).

Rest in Peace, Gordon “Drewe” Henley, who choked on a pie and died on Valentines’ Day.|||
