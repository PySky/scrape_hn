SC2 never fully loads the game initially, but rather streams and loads required files on demand. Unit Preloader is a special map which forces SC2 to load all units, animations and effects, causing high RAM usage, but prevents loading the data (and massive framerate drops) during multiplayer matches. Open Arcade and search for Unit Preloader. There are 3 versions - start the one which corresponds to the game edition you'll want to play in multiplayer and wait for the Victory screen. All data will be preloaded until you exit the game to desktop.|||
