The dock that unlocks the Galaxy S8’s desktop PC-like experience will retail for $149.99, according to Samsung’s website. It’s scheduled to ship in “late April,” likely coinciding with the widespread launch of the company’s latest flagship smartphone. That’s not exactly cheap, but you can probably expect to see some deals for DeX; T-Mobile is giving a free dock to its @Work enterprise customers who reserve the Galaxy S8 in-store.

The DeX Station, as Samsung calls it, attaches to your Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus via USB-C and lets you plug in an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. It’s designed to heighten productivity, giving users the tools and experience (windowed apps, etc.) that they’re accustomed to getting from a full-fledged desktop. You also have full access to your regular phone notifications and incoming calls / texts. The DeX Station features two USB 2.0 ports, an ethernet jack, HDMI, and a USB-C port for charging everything. There’s a fan built in to keep your Galaxy running cool while in desktop mode.

We’ve seen iterations of this idea over and over and over again, although Samsung already seems to be doing a slightly better job than Microsoft despite Continuum’s head start. Ultimately though, these are still Android apps running on a bigger screen, and the idea that DeX will be seen as some kind of killer app for the Galaxy S8 is... a questionable. Same goes for Bixby. Then again, most people will probably be sold on the S8 just by looking at the screen.|||

Turning your Galaxy into a PC won’t be cheap.
