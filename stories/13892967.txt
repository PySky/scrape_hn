Retrieve the Key in a Program/Script

 You can use Go Hashicorp api package to connect to vault:



This was demonstration of basic vault server setup and client authentication. There are many more different aspects to it. For further information please refer to vault documentation https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/index.html|||
