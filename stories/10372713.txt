Just about every one dreads the trip to the dentist office. Even the experienced well trained dentist can cause a little pain from time to time I’m sure.

What this deranged dentist in Florida did to this poor little 6 year old girl named Bri’el that just boggles the mind, all to defraud Medicare.

The little girls Mother Brandy Motley was told she could not stay with her daughter while the dentistry work was being performed, then giving her the bogus reason that children were tougher to deal with when parents are in the room.

The girls mother believed there was going to be one tooth pulled, this sicko removed 7 in all.

Unfortunately, this is not the only horrendous incident involving Dr. Schneider, there are at least 60 others.

Motley told CNN that three hours into Bri’el’s visit a nurse came into the waiting room and told the mother that there was “an incident.” The mother allegedly found her daughter hyperventilating and with blood all over her and bruises on her neck. Motley grabbed her daughter and immediately drove to an emergency room. Bri’el was supposed to have only one tooth removed, but Motley told CNN she soon realized the dentist had pulled out seven of Bri’el’s front teeth.

As horrifying as Motley’s experience is, she’s far from alone. The Daily Mail reports that after Motley posted about her experience on social media, more and more parents have come forward to speak about the abuse Dr. Schneider had allegedly caused.|||
