Lib.Net.Http.EncryptedContentEncoding is available on NuGet.

There are blog posts available describing implementation details and showing usage samples:

Lib.Net.Http.EncryptedContentEncoding has a dependency on Bouncy Castle. The .NET Framework version is using BouncyCastle package which is well known and widely downloaded, but the .NET Core version is using BouncyCastle.CoreClr package which is quite new and comes from different author. As those packages provide cryptography routines make sure you want to use them and remember that you can always download the source code and run your own build.|||
