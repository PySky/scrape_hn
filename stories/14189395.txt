The mysterious flying-car startup funded by Google cofounder Larry Page, Kitty Hawk, took the wraps off its first vehicle on Monday.

The Kitty Hawk Flyer looks a mix between a flying Jet Ski and, as John Markoff of The New York Times puts it, "something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts." It's designed to be flown over water and will be available for sale by the end of this year, Kitty Hawk says.

Kitty Hawk says its Flyer can be operated without a pilot's license as long as you fly it in "uncongested areas." The startup hasn't said how much the Flyer will cost, but it's offering an early $2,000 discount for people who are willing to pay $100 now to get on the wait-list.

Here's everything we know so far about the Kitty Hawk Flyer and the other flying cars Page is funding:
