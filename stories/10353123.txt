James entered his bathroom after waking up late. He pushed through the bathroom door bleary eyed. He had an important meeting today and he was already running ten minutes late.

As he stepped into the bathroom the lights turned on automatically thanks to the motion sensor he had installed last year. The lights were OLEDs that used next to no electricity and operated on induction technology therefore requiring no wiring. Wiring what wiring James smiled to himself. The lights couldn’t have wiring as they were literally stick on lights. There were four in a pack and you literally stuck them where ever you wanted.

James turned on the shower. He had installed the new shower nozzle, the Nebia, two years ago which used about 70 percent less water than previous shower heads. He went towards the sink and held his hand near the base of the tap to start the water going. He brushed his teeth and took out his skarp razor. Thanks to the laser tech no more cuts or rashes after shaving. Hell, no more having to use shaving cream or replace blades. He tapped his hand against the base of the tap to turn off the water and quickly stepped into the shower. After a minute he stepped out feeling awake and alert. He took his heated towel from the rack, got dressed and made it to that meeting on time.
