Lumi is a news app available on Android (as well as web) that comes the closest to being the Tinder for news. What makes it special is just not its swipe based interface , but also how well it incorporates social features along with data science.

It shows you articles from Twitter and your friends friends likes. Every time you like or skip a story, it learns more about you to provide you with more relevant information.

The best thing we liked about is its ease of use (especially itâ€™s pretty easy to get started on this one).

Made by the founders of Last.fm, it covers everything from current affairs to music with content pulled from major publications as well as small, indie sites.

Go ahead, try it today.|||
