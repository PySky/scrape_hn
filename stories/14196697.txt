The International Bank Note Society (IBNS) announces that its voting membership has selected the Swiss National Bank to receive its prestigious “Bank Note of the Year Award” for 2016. With almost 120 new banknotes released worldwide during 2016, over half were of sufficiently new design to be eligible for nomination. While the Swiss 50 Franc hybrid note was the narrow winner, runners-up in very tight voting were the Maldive Islands 1000 Rufiyaa tortoise/whale shark, Argentina’s 500 Peso jaguar, and the Royal Bank of Scotland’s 5 Pound first polymer note.|||
