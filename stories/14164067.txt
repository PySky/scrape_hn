Just 22 days ago began the deployment of Android Wear 2.0, the new major version of the OS for wearable devices that came first to the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport makes no more than two months.

Among those devices that miss the arrival of Android Wear 2.0, are the second generation Moto 360 and Huawei Watch, two of the most important wearables last year, and a few more Asus and LG. Finally, by the end of this month or May, they will have their Wear 2.0 ration.

Ernest, the community manager of support forums Android Wear, has published a few hours ago its reiteration about the devices that will have Wear 2.0, and that we knew beforehand, other new models from other manufacturers who will also receive the update.

So, finally, the list of terminals compatible with Android Wear 2.0 is increasing and those wearables that have been able to give a little note last year will get some of the best features of the new version.

The watches that will receive Android Wear 2.0 in late April or May are:

As it is not a specific date, it will be necessary to be patient in order for these wearables to have the ability to install apps independently through the Google Play Store, one of the best features of Android Wear 2.0.

The other great feature is the ability to pay with Android Pay, although you need NFC chip, an item that is only available on the LG Watch Urbane second edition LTE.|||
