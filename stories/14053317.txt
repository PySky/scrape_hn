Our aim is to empower a market of 2 billion people who cur-

 rently don’t have access to banking across the world. Almost half the

 world — over three billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day.

 At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. More than

 80 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where income

 differentials are widening|||
