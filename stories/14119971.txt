In 1975 the Austrian civil engineer Hermann Knoflacher developed the Walkmobile or Gehzeug a wood frame worn by a pedestrian with the purpose to occupy the same space quantity as a motorist. The walkmobile is a tool of protest against the record of cars in city that easily allows to visualize the irrationality of the engine urban traffic and the fact that it takes up an excessive part of ground .

The experiment of Knoflacher has been repeated in different big cities in the world, from Austria to Thailand, showing the territorial potentialities of the urban areas without cars.
