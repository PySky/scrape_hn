Allset, a service that lets users make a reservation, order their food and pay the bill all before sitting down at a table, has expanded to Seattle.

The idea behind the San Francisco-based restaurant startup is that users will be able to complete all parts of a meal, except for eating, from a smartphone or other device. It means that diners can show up at a restaurant, be seated immediately with their food right in front of them. The company says its service can speed up a sit-down meal and get people in and out in less than half an hour.

“We’re creating a new dining culture at times when the both sides of the table need it the most,” Stas Matviyenko, CEO of Allset said in a statement. “People in big cities want their trip to a restaurant to be more efficient. Restaurants need to keep up with the pace of modern life and serve in speed and quality. This is where Allset enters the game to ensure that both diners and restaurants achieve success.”

Allset’s aim to speed up meals has the potential to disrupt the business lunch. The company has a feature that lets employers make reservations and pre-pay for employee meals.

Approximately 50 restaurants will be part of Allset’s network in Seattle within a month, the company said. The company plans to launch in more cities this year, as well as strengthen its presence in current markets.

Allset is free for users, but charges a service fee to restaurants. The company last year landed $2.35 million in funding in a round led by New York-based Metamorphic Ventures, which also included venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz.|||
