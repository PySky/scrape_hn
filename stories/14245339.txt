I've decided to move on from Elm. I've only been successful in 1 of 3 projects. I'm now in a role where I need to make an important decision regarding the transition of a codebase from Angular to something else, and I don't feel like I can responsibly recommend Elm as the replacement. So I need to focus my time and effort elsewhere.

If someone could please remove me as a moderator of elm-discuss it would be appreciated.

If anyone is interested in taking the `canadaduane/typed-svg` project over, I'd be happy to help transition it to willing hands.|||
