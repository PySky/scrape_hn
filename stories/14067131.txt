I was sentenced to 32 months in prison in the UK after hacking the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. I went under the alias "PabloEscobar" and was also responsible for defacing the US Navvy website included in the final Lulzsec dump. I ran the #tutorials channel on the Anonymous IRC servers teaching others how to hack and also contributed to providing reconnaissance and intelligence for active operations.

The media reported I was caught via my IP address. This is lies. At the time I performed the attack I was in contact with Sabu who knew what I was doing, and what I did. This information was relayed back to the UK police via the FBI because he was an informant. This information could not be printed in the media. My name is mentioned on his wiki page with a link back to one of the first articles that reported it.

Since leaving prison I have helped companies such as Facebook, Soundclound, and Yahoo secure their applications. In 2013 I was listed on Facebook's hackers hall of fame. I was also responsible for discovering a serious vulnerability on 4G routers that EE later patched and rewarded me.

People have often asked me to create an AMA so here it is. Ask me anything and I will answer with complete honesty.

The account above was the one used in media articles such as this one.

This image is page 1 of a 38 page case file. As you can see it lists my name, and some information on the charge, date of sentence, sentencing court etc.

Edit I'm online to answer some questions for a bit today. Ask away :)|||
