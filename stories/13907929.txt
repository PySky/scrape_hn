Going away? Gmail can respond automatically to your emails, but not your chat messages. Autoresponder can fill the gap.

Have accounts that foward email that you never log into? You could be missing chat messages. Autoresponder can tell people how to get in touch and let you know about incoming messages.|||

Set up automatic responses to unmonitored Google Chat accounts.
