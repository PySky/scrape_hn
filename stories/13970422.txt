Apple is now rolling out the official macOS 10.12.4 release through the Mac App Store. The latest version of macOS Sierra is the first to bring Night Shift to the Mac.

macOS 10.12.4 beta included changes to Siri, Dictation, and Apple’s PDF API:

This is how Apple describes its Night Shift feature:

Night Shift adjusts the color of your display after sunset. Many studies show that exposure to bright-blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. After sunset, Night Shift will shift your display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum, making the display easier on your eyes. In the morning, your display returns to its regular settings.

See how to enable Night Shift and how the feature works on the Mac here.
