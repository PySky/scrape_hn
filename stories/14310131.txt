Today, on stage at Microsoft’s Build Conference in Seattle, Principal Program Manager Scott Hanselman, announced a couple of major updates for Microsoft’s cloud computing platform.

The biggest is a brand new management application for Android and iOS, which promises to allow sysadmins to manage their systems from their mobile devices. I can’t imagine doing much legwork from the cramped real-estate of an iPhone, but it’s pretty cool to have the option to view real-time analytics, and restart and provision virtual machines your phone.

The other big change was the Azure Cloud Shell, which allows developers to quickly log into their provisioned systems from the Azure portal, as well as the two new mobile applications. This is a full BASH shell, with PowerShell soon to follow.

This is pretty amazing, as it lets you access the Azure CLI from anywhere, with your credentials already authenticated. So, you can just log-in and go to work.
