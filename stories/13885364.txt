Sometimes getting to a good docker based setup for your new project is a little too inconvenient.

This repository aims to maintain a collection of up-to-date quickstart base repos that will help you bootstrap your shiny new docker project.

Folders in this repo represent base repos for web frameworks, CMSs or databases.
