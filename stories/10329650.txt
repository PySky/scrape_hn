Ok â€“ First, I know some folks are going to challenge this math, but I think itâ€™s basically correct. Second, being a VC is hard. Â Not always 100 hours-a-week hard work, but hard to do well. But â€” investing in someone elseâ€™s hard work is obviously far easier than founding and inventing something yourself.

With that, let me explain why VCs should be insanely rich:

What about VCs? Â What do they effectively own, as individuals? Â A lot more than you think:

So VCs get 2.5-4x the equivalent ownership stake of a founder, with very few of the operating hassles â€” and they get to pick. Â As a founder, you do get to pick, sort of. Â But only one gig at a time â€“ not 8. I know this oversimplifies things. Â It ignores basis, and many other nuances. Â And picking is hard. Â But inventing something from nothing is harder. So my point is : VCs should be insanely rich ðŸ˜‰|||
