Here in California, we’re in a tough battle over how and when the government can search through the digital devices of teachers and students. A terrible proposal—A.B. 165—seeks to strip over 6-million Californians of privacy safeguards baked into our state laws, giving the government a loophole to rifle through personal digital devices in schools without a warrant issued by a judge.

We’re looking for individuals in California’s public schools who can report on experiences with digital device searches. Are you a student who had a school administrator search your device without your consent? Are you a parent whose son or daughter was punished because of data found on their device? Are you a teacher who has seen or been part of questionable searches in the school context? We want to hear about it.

Types of stories that would be especially useful for us:

Please report stories using our survey and share this request with your friends.

A.B. 165 is currently scheduled for a hearing before the Assembly Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection on April 18. That means that right now is a very important time to make sure all our California legislators hear us. Please speak out now against A.B. 165.

Not in California? You can still make a difference. Please reach out to your friends in California and ask them to speak out, and please share this blog post on social media.
