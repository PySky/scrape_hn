NIGERIANS WORKERS ARE TIRED OF NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT OVER MINIMUM WAGE

Frankly speaking, Nigerian civil servant are under federal government spell that even if you want fight for your right you will threaten that to lost your job, this antics pave way for the government to penetrate and build on the weakness of it civil servant. They found it difficult to increase the minimum wage, while their salaries is increase at the detriment of civil servant salaries.The federal government became a perpetual lairs that the masses will never trust them again, in our life time, we are patient enough, we gave them a enough time to check themselves is the same story we always hear from them, when Buhari emerge as a president he always sing a song to our ear, the title of the song is " I FEEL YOUR PAIN"Â  now he has stop feeling our pain.The issue of minimum wage is lurking in the national assembly since the inception of Buhari led administration, they use two years to formed a committee for minimum wage still we had no fruitful result on that. The 18,000 Naira for minimum wage was not only peanut but a meager amount for civil servant in Nigeria.The cost of goods and service as sky-rocketed in the market and cost of living in the country have soar high, people can't afford better houses, foods and schools for their kids no more. The federal government are not helping matters, they are just total failure on my side.|||
