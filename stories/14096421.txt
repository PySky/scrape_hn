How often do you hear complaints about a software development team who got the wrong idea about a customer’s project and ended up not providing them with what they expected? Now ask the developers what they think about it.

The team of CactusSoft business analysts offers the following guidance to its customers on how to make an RFP efficient and clear for everyone.
