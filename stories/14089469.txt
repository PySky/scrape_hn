I read the 1st edition several years ago and I finally decided to buy the book (new 2nd edition). As far as I can tell, the only differences from the 1st edition is the new foreward. So there's no reason to buy the 2nd edition if you already have the 1st one.



This is an exceptional book because it makes Fourier analysis intuitive. It's amazing how simple the Fourier Series is (once you get how it really works). Most texts on the subject overwhelm the reader with equations without bothering to explain what the equations do. (I even question if some of the authors of such texts really understand what they're doing either.) The book also covers basic calculus (which is needed to compute Fourier Series) and then introduces the Fourier Transform (for non-periodic signals) and the FFT.



Unfortunately, I agree with some of the reviews of the 1st edition which feel that the latter is brief and rushed compared to the 1st section. (I personally feel the book should have focused on the DFT vs. the FFT- since the DFT is much easier to understand than the FFT). My only other quibble is that I don't like the fact that the book is so physically big- my guess is that comic books in Japan are this size. But these minor complaints can't keep me from giving it the 5 stars.



For those looking for the next step, I highly recommend Steven Smith's "Digital Signal Processing" (very intuitive) and Richard Lyons' "Understanding DSP" (still intuitive but more mathematical).



Note: Amazon is inconsistent- for some 2nd editions, they retain the reviews from the 1st edition. But for this book, they didn't even though it's really the same book.|||
