GitHub API HTTP client with cache support to get the most of your rate limit.

This module provides a configured instance of the popular request module to work more efficientely with the public GitHub API.

Notice that streaming is not supported by this module.

GitHub allows a maximum of 5000 requests per hour for authenticated requests and 60 requests per hour for non authenticated requests. This default rate limiting might not be enough to meet the needs of an application that intensively communicates with the GitHub API.

See Rate Limiting for more details.

If a GitHub API response contains either an or HTTP header, will locally cache the response of such request and will send or request headers when the same API resource is called again. If GitHub responds with a code, this means that the content of the response didn't change, so we fetch it from the local cache and your rate limit remains intact.

See Conditional Requests for more details.

This is handled for you automatically so you don't have to bother messing with HTTP headers yourself.

This module includes the following modifications to :
