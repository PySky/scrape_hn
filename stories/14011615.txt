Idris version 1.0 has been released. You can find it on hackage or from the download page. Documentation is available from docs.idris-lang.org.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed, whether by providing code, documentation, testing, issue reports, or encouragement. You can find the names of the contributors in the source repository.

Idris version 1.0 corresponds to the language as described in Type-Driven Development with Idris, published last week by Manning.

As described here, there is still much to do. Idris is primarily a research tool, arising from research into software development with dependent types which aims to make theorem proving and software verification accessible and practical for software developers in general. In calling this “1.0”, we mean no more than that the core language and base libraries are stable, and that you can expect any code that compiles with version 1.0 to compile with any version 1.x.

Since Idris has less than one person working on it full time, we don’t promise “production readiness”, in that there is still a lot to do to make the compiler and run time efficient, and there may be libraries you need which are not available. And, there will certainly be bugs! Please let us know via the issue tracker if you encounter any problems.

We will always welcome contributions, however small. Some specific contributions needed are described on the wiki.
