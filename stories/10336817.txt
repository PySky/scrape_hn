The sheer existence of Bitcoin clarifies what all of us suspected already.

There are quite a few intellectual professions that are being replaced or will be replaced by software. If an intellectual activity can conceivably be performed by computers, it is not a valid intellectual endeavour. Furthermore, you cannot keep making a living out of what a machine can do as well: faster, cheaper and with fewer errors.

Software construction itself is immune to replacement by software, because software can generally not be constructed by other software. The 1936 Church-Turing computability answer to David Hilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem precludes this eventuality. Therefore, the most intellectually-valid activity possible is the construction of software. Everybody else should ask themselves the question whether they are truly valid intellectuals. Indeed, their intellectual activity could simply be invalid.

Bitcoin demonstrates to us that money-transfer banking is not a valid intellectual activity and that such bankers are not intellectuals.

If we benchmark all intellectual activity against the standard for human ingenuity, the construction of software — the intellectual validity of which is 100% — some other professions will come close to the ideal and may even achieve something like 80%. However, we now know that bankers achieve exactly 0%.|||
