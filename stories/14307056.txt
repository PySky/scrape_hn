Kenya is set to see the introduction of mobile money interoperability as early as July 2017. This would mean that subscribers would be able to send and receive money between different mobile money operators.

With Safaricom's M-PESA being the dominant mobile money platform, smaller operators like Equitel which now accounts for one fifth of Kenya's mobile money transactions, have recently been calling for mobile money interoperability in Kenya.

"With M-Pesa and the many other mobile money services, as of today, we agreed with the industry that there is going to be mobile money interoperability," said Joe Mucheru, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of ICT in Kenya.

Mucheru made the announcemeearlier in May 2017 at the East Africa Cyber Security Forum.

According to Mucheru, it was also agreed that mobile money operators would pay no termination fee for a trial period of six months for mobile money transfers.|||
