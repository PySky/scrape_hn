is a command line image resizer and rotator for JPEG and PNG images. If you have tons of images you want to resize adaptively to a screen resolution or rotate by an angle using a single command, is the utility for you. It can save a lot on storage too.

Powered by multiprocessing, an intelligent adaptive algorithm, recursive operations, shell completion scripts, EXIF preservation (and more), is a very flexible utility with well-documented easy to use options.

intends to be a stronger replacement of the Nautilus Image Converter extension, not tied to any file manager and way faster. On desktop environments (like Xfce or LxQt) which do not integrate Nautilus, will save your day.

For example, if an image has a resolution of 2048x1365 and is being resized to 1366x768:

could resize 8823 images (approx. 4.5GB in size) of mixed resolutions (high to regular) stored in a USB 2.0 external hard disk at an adaptive resolution of 1366x1000 in around 8 minutes. The resulting size was 897MB (approx. 20%).

uses Python PIL/Pillow library. Nautilus Image Converter calls the utility from ImageMagick. For a comparative benchmark, head here.

pillow can be replaced by pillow-simd on SIMD processors.
