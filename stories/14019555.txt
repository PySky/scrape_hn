Cinco de Mayo is a celebration held on May 5. The date is observed to commemorate the Mexican Army’s unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza.

In Canada, Cinco de Mayo has taken on a significance beyond that in Mexico. In Canada the date has become associated with the celebration of Mexican culture. In Mexico, the commemoration of the battle continues to be mostly ceremonial, such as through military parades.
