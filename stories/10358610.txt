Chimp Management will be doing various projects on our social media (Facebook) from short informative videos to Q&A sessions with our Psychological Skills Mentors. It will be a great chance to get involved and ask any questions you might have around the topics they discuss. Our CEO, Steve will also be on The One Show (UK’s BBC1 TV channel) tonight (Monday 8th May) to speak around the topic of Mental Health so please don’t miss it. We also have the following:

“eliciting emotional ill health can often be a piece of detective work… When we lose our internal feelings of security we often try to reinstate them by controlling our external environment, including others.”

“During Mental Health Awareness Week, the consultant psychiatrist, and author of The Chimp Paradox which is very popular among business professionals and anyone working in a pressure cooker environment, took the time to explain how he developed a mind management model to help people deal with anxiety, one of the leading causes of mental ill-health in the world.”|||

A company set up and run by Professor Steve Peters to provide services across Sport, Education, Health, Business and the general public, to help individuals, teams and organisations apply the Chimp Mind Management model to enable them to get the best out of themselves and others.
