Sample project to demonstrate how to use the new dagger-android module in latest Dagger v2.11-rc1. Along with Proguard rules. Also shows MVVM pattern and Unit Test setup with Mockito on the side.

Right now you maybe getting the Application instance from Activity and injecting ("hydrating") instances based off of that. But the latest version of dagger basically decouples your Activity from knowing who your is.

So this sample project was built because I myself spent a bit of time getting dagger-android module setup at my company Instavans. There are things like getting all the correct library versions to work together. So here is a working starting point on how to use Dagger's which you can build upon.|||
