I created the SaaS Financial Plan in Excel, so that SaaS startups and SMB’s could easily create their own financial forecast.  Many Excel forecast models become very complex, but I created step-by-step instructions with links to input cells so you can easily create your first forecast.

I am constantly improving and updating the the model with more metrics, charts, and features.  Please bookmark this page and check back for the latest version.  I would love to hear your feedback.

Release versions are below with comments.  You can download the latest SaaS Financial Plan below.

Please enter your valid email below (no spam) to download v1.35.  I’ll keep you updated on future models.|||
