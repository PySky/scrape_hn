I am always looking for ways to type less. I find that when I am working I usually search and run the last commands in my bash history. This made me think it would be nice to have a way to roll up the last commands into a single script.

Here is the bash function I came up with:

Lets break this down. The command takes two arguments and . It then sets up a basic template of a bash script in my personal folder. The meat of the function is this line:

The built in function prints out all of the commands I have run in my terminal. The history is then piped (sent) to which grabs the last commands. The output might look something like this:

The next portion is used to get rid of the line numbers in the history output. We are then left with just the bash commands that I have run. These are then appended to the end of the new script template we wrote at the beginning of the script.

Now I can run , which pulls the last two commands out of my history and writes a script called to my personal bin directory. I have this directory in my so I am instantly able to run and that will execute those commands.|||
