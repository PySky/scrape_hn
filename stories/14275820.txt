While Kubernetes is ushering in a world where SSH is less necessary on a daily basis for deploying and managing applications, there are still instances when SSH is necessary for gathering statistics, debugging issues, and repairing configuration issues. So, while years from now there may not be a need to SSH and run one-off debugging sessions, the tools below are useful for quickly SSH'ing into machines in your Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes has a database of nodes in the cluster which can be queried with . This is a powerful database for automation and integration with existing tools. One powerful tool is the Fabric SSH utility, which is known as a .

Install the Fabric SSH utility and test it:

Git clone this repo and move into the directory:

Fabric will use the Â from the root of this directory. So now Kubernetes Nodes and labels are integrated directly into fabric! Here is an example session using this integration:

Many configurations of Kubernetes, like CoreOS Tectonic, do not enable direct SSH access to machines in the cluster, and instead users must first access gateway or bastion hosts. If the Kubernetes cluster has this configuration, add the flag to the command and change the address type to InternalIP.

By default the fabfile will use the of nodes. However, it can be configured to use any IP address that a Node has available. The example above uses the common field. To change this to a custom export the environment variable .

If you have any questions about Fabric or any other aspect of Kubernetes and other CoreOS open source projects, ask the team directly at CoreOS Fest! The Kubernetes and distributed systems conference takes place May 31 and June 1 in San Francisco - join us for two days of talks from the community on the latest developments in the open source container ecosystem.
