Google removed Pinyin from Google Maps in Taiwan on April 26th.

I made an alternative, because people are asking for it.

It'sfor public release, but sending bug reports to Google has fallen on deaf ears. If you're travelling in Taiwan, please feel free to use it.

If you're a programmer and want to help improve the GUI, please contact me.|||
