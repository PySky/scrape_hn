This project has been discontinued! Thank you for your interest in FossaMail, an Open Source, Mozilla Thunderbird-based mail, news and chat client for Windows and Linux.

 

 It was an alternative version of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail&news client, and based on the Pale Moon browser core.

 

 Unfortunately, due to lack of time to maintain the code, and lack of users and funds, we've discontinued this project.
