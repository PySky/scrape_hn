I just wanted to give this thread a bump, it seems like UPC have tried to push this under the rug, but there really isn't any reason for doing what they are. I have the 150MB package and a 5ghz enabled computer in a rented house, so I can't rewire it to run an ethernet cable through the house, so I'm relying on the 5ghz features in the router that UPC have provided. 

 

 Could we get an update on why UPC have blocked the true dual band features of the router please? A succinct and reasoned answer would be much appreciated. Please don't be afraid to get technical to help explain your reasoning, as it will help clear up any confusion. 

 

 I would imagine a quick software update could be pushed back to the routers in the event that UPC identify this a an error for any reason. Come to think of it, has the software OTA update feature been killed too? I can't seem to see it...

 

 Edit: Is this a 'dual band' or 'dual radio/simultaneous dual band' router? Seems like dual band routers have this restriction by default, so may be not deactivated as previously mentioned? Either way, a reply from UPC would be helpful to remove confusion.
