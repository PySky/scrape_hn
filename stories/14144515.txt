Why did Peter Thiel invest in Facebook??

Interesting question. Peter Thiel was one of the first investors in Facebook (Hell he WAS the first outside investor for the Social Networking website). When Facebook launched, they employed a very creative strategy, giving access to college students in the East and West coasts of USA. Then it expanded rapidly.

Thiel probably invested in Facebook due to:

Less Competition - Apart from Orkut, Facebook didn’t have many competitors. So Facebook in itself sought to create a monopoly of sorts.

Innovative approach - Facebook first started in colleges targeting the younger audience and this caught Thiel’s eye. Plus the team that founded Facebook - Zuckerberg, Saverin, Moscowitz and Hughes knew each other for a long time at Harvard. Thiel’s mantra is “co-founders should have known each other for a long period of time so that there is a sense of trust”. Even PayPal used a similar strategy as Facebook, that is giving access to a few people. Thiel was also perhaps impressed by that.

Time and Place - Thiel says “Every product has a time when it’ll be successful” and “Every moment in the history of science and technology happens only once. The next Bill Gates won't be building an operating system, the next Larry page won't be building a search engine …”. If Facebook was an operating system or a search engine, Thiel wouldn’t have invested. He references his own start-up PayPal and says “If someone tried to do PayPal in 1995 it would’ve failed due to very few people having email addresses or if someone tried PayPal in 2010s, again it would’ve failed due to a large number of people having emails and a number of fin-tech startups”. Everything has a time. He foresaw Facebook as a big thing and invested in it.

Competition is for losers, yeah, but it also depends on the time and the strategy used by the founders.|||
