My configuration file has a directive block that begins with...

...in order to allow the site to be accessed with different domain names.

However PHP's always returns the first entry of , in this case

So I have no way from the PHP code to know which domain the user used to access the site.

Is there any way to tell nginx/fastcgi to pass the real domain name used to access the site?

The only solution I've found so far is to repeat the entire block for each domain with a distinct entry but obviously I'm looking for a better one.|||
