When the Haas 2CA rocket launches, it will be the first rocket in history to place itself entirely into orbit. This opens new frontiers for exploration of the Solar System as the rocket can be refueled in-orbit and re-utilize its aerospike engine, thus eliminating the need for additional upper stages. This rocket is extremely simple and, therefore, affordable to construct and operate, and it can be launched on a weekly, even daily, basis. After the full qualification, the vehicle could be operated from inland spaceports as there are no stages that fall on the ground at burnout. It's intended to be the most responsive orbital launcher ever created, being able to reach orbit in less than 24 hours from the moment of launch decision. This rocket will also be the fastest vehicle to reach orbit, less than 5 minutes from the launch.|||
