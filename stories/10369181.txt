One way to write FizzBuzz program in Java 8 using Stream API.

Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

The above program will run into integer overflow. You can use BigInteger to overcome that as shown below.

The better and more functional approach suggested(in the comments) by Dominic is shown below.|||
