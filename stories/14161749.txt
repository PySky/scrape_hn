This release introduces Composed Tasks ! This feature provides the ability to orchestrate a flow of tasks as a cohesive unit-of-work. A complex ETL pipeline may include executions in sequence, parallel, conditional transitions, or a combination of all of the above. The composed task feature comes with DSL primitives and an interactive graphical interface to quickly build these type of topologies more easily. You can read more about it from the reference guide.

An ETL job, for example, may include multiple steps. Each step in the topology can be built as a finite short-lived Spring Cloud Task application. The orchestration of multiple tasks as steps can be easily defined with the help of the Data Flow Task DSL.

This will first run and then run and in parallel, waiting for the both of them to complete before running the three remaining tasks in parallel and waiting for them to all complete before ending the job. The graphical representation of this topology looks like the following.|||
