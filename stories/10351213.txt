I except a little more from a paid app. This one looks like it hasn't been updated since Windows 8.0. It has no elements of responsive design and the UI falls off the screen or gets scroll bars if the app isn't maximized. It really, really, needs to be updated for Windows 10 before I give any money. There are other free options in the store, but I'd like to support the developers... they just have to support us first.|||
