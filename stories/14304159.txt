A new kind of school crafted by the minds and wallets of Silicon Valley influencers is going through a growth spurt.

AltSchool, an educational software developer and network of "micro-schools" with locations in California and New York, has raised $40 million in a new round of funding, according to an SEC filing.

The startup previously raised over $130 million from Silicon Valley giants including Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz.

In May 2015, Business Insider spent the day at AltSchool's Fort Mason location in San Francisco to see its revolutionary teaching style in action.|||
