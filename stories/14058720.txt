When you're on a gluten free diet, you avoid processed foods full with chemicals and toxic ingredients. You're more likely to eat fruits and vegetables because they're completely gluten free, removing the worry of cross contamination. When I eliminated gluten from my diet. I couldn't snack on things like bread, cakes and cookies. I found myself munching on apples, carrots and grapes. Overall adding more nutritious foods to my diet.

I notice that I lost weight when I went gluten free. I was less bloated because I ate fresh foods. I couldn't binge eat baked goods like cookies and cakes. When someone offered me food, most of the time it had gluten or I was worried about cross contamination, so I rejected it and grabbed an apple or some sort of fruit instead.

Before I went gluten free, I always felt bloating and had lots of digestion problems. After a meal I wanted to take a nap and I never had any energy. After going gluten free, I felt more energized. My body can finally digest all the vitamins and mineral in my food. I also notice a big improvement in my bowel habits.|||
