More than 20,000 people responded to our 2017 New Coder Survey, granting researchers an unprecedented glimpse into how adults are learning to code.

We’ve released the entire dataset of participants’ individual responses to more than 50 questions — under the Open Data Common License — on a public GitHub repository.

In the months that follow, dozens of data scientists will pore over the data and discover all kinds of insights about people who are learning to code.

For now, I’m going to give you a high-level idea of who these new coders are, how they’re learning, and what their goals are.

More than 20,000 new coders responded to this survey. These are people who have been coding for less than 5 years.

Here are some basic facts about them:|||
