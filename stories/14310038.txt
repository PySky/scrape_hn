High-end digital photography company Phase One has announced a new camera called the IQ3 100MP Achromatic that is chock-full of impressive specs. But it also comes with two really good reasons why you or I will never buy it: the camera only shoots in black and white, and it costs $50,000 without any lenses.

Much like the Leica M Monochrom, the IQ3 100MP Achromatic doesn’t have the Bayer color filter found in most digital cameras. What that means, according to Phase One, is the image sensor can “focus purely on capturing absolute detail, luminance values and subtle tonal beauty.” Basically, the camera has less stuff in the way of the image sensor, meaning you can use it to capture images with ludicrous detail, like this one from Phase One’s site:

The IQ3 100MP Achromatic captures that detail with, oddly enough, a 101-megapixel CMOS image sensor. It’s also capable of shooting up to 51,200 ISO. The camera has built-in Wi-Fi, too, though you’ll probably need a fidget spinner or something like it just to pass the time it’ll take to transfer those files. And, of course, the boxy camera uses the same 3.2-inch touchscreen found on Phase One’s other IQ3 cameras which, funny story, is capable of displaying color.|||
