You may include as many litter items in 1 photo as you want but make sure each item is visible. You are the one who has the process them and they must pass verification.

3. Upload and process your images Simply drop your images into our drop-box and we will extract the coordinates (Lat/Long) and timestamp (yyyy:mm:dd hh:mm:ss) from each image. Then tag litter on each image on your Profile and submit each image for verification.

Only images that the crowd or Admins allow to pass will be automatically included in the maps, charts and graphs. Users can vote True or False on each image and once it achieves verification, it will move into "Stage One" verification. Admins will also check each image and once correct they will achieve the more trusted "Stage Two" level of verification. Once data reaches stage two we can delete the image and keep our costs as low as possible.|||
