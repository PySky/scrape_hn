Searching for a new job is tedious. It takes a lot of time and mind space to apply to multiple companies, keep track of what you've sent and what stage each of these interviews are in.

I'm building a product that will give you insights into the jobs that you've applied to, what stage each of these interviews are in and how much time you've spent interviewing for each.

We're planning to roll out the initial version in a week and are looking for early candidates to explore the product. Signup know to be an early member and unlock great discounts when we move out of beta.|||
