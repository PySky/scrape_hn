CloudBoost is the Complete NoSQL Database Service for your app. Think of CloudBoost as Parse + Firebase + Algolia + Iron.io all combined into one :

You can install CloudBoost anywhere you like. We have a Docker Compose file that can help you get started with CloudBoost in few minutes and with just one command. You can use this compose file to install the service locally on your local dev machine, or you can install the service to Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, Softlayer, Packet and more.

CloudBoost runs on MongoDB and Redis. You're responsible for managing the uptime, replication, sharding, backups of your data in each of these databases.

You also need to update CloudBoost with every new release and you need to configure your server to auto-scale it. If you're using Docker, the image is released at the tag and you need to check for new releases atleast once a month.

Using our hosted and managed service helps you to save time, development costs, and eliminates managing your own cluster of servers which is cheaper long-term. We recommend using the hosted service if you're running production apps.
