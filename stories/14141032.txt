Hang out with your friends in a fun, interactive virtual environment as if you were in the same room, no matter where you are. Use your Facebook photos to create your virtual self, then invite your Facebook friends to join you. You’ll find a variety of Facebook content, including 360 videos and photos, that can transport you to new places. Draw 3D objects with virtual markers, video call your friends outside of VR, and share selfies of your VR memories on Facebook. With Facebook Spaces, you can hang out in a whole new way – together.|||

VR is better with Friends!
