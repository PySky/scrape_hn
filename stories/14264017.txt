More and more people are curious about living in smaller spaces, whether it's for financial freedom or to just get free of the tyranny of 'stuff'. But tiny dwellings aren't only for living in, they can also be places to rent out to provide extra income. Built by Liberation Tiny Homes (previously), this online guesthouse rental in Egg Harbor, New Jersey -- named the River Resort -- features a nice, clean design and two sleeping lofts.

Built on a 28-foot-long trailer and topped with a shed roof, the guesthouse has its seating area off to one end. Thanks to this positioning, there seems like there is more space here to lounge around compared to other tiny homes that plunk seating down almost as an afterthought. As a bonus, this sectional couch here also turns into a double bed.

You can see the built-in double staircase here that splits off into the two 8' by 8' lofts. Storage is integrated into the staircases, to allow guests to put their things away. Designing a small space means a balancing of compromises, and here, the headspace in the lofts looks a tad cramped.

The kitchen feels cozy, and has a full-sized refrigerator and an unobtrusive nub of a bar counter.

The dine-in counter seems all right -- but it's made out of concrete and reclaimed wood and is our least favourite thing about the whole project. It may have been better to place a window here to look out of (no one likes to eat facing a wall).

Sliding open the reclaimed oak wood barn door and into the bathroom, we see one of the rare creatures of the tiny house world -- a bathtub, measuring 4 feet long. The house also has all-LED lighting, birch plywood wall panelling, a 30-amp electrical system and a propane on-demand water heater.

We don't see double sleeping lofts all that often, and this one tackles it pretty well. For more information, visit Liberation Tiny Homes or to book, visit AirBnb.|||
