Welcome to Python 101! I created this course to help you learn Python 3. My objective is to get you acquainted with the building blocks of Python so that you can write something useful yourself. With interactive playgrounds to help you learn right away, I will endeavor to not only get you up to speed on the basics, but also to show you how to create useful programs.

This course will be split into five parts:

Part-I covers Python's basics.
Part-II is a small subset of Python's Standard Library.
Part-III is intermediate material.
Part-IV is a series of small tutorials.
Part-V covers Python packaging and distribution.
