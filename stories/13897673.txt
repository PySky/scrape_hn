This Chrome extension lets you browse Hacker News comment threads by username. I made this because I often enter threads just to see if someone I like has said anything.

Clicking a user on the right over and over lets you scroll through their comments. You can star users by clicking the asterisk next to their name, and they'll show up in orange at the top in any thread they've participated in.

Get it from the Chrome Web Store.

hnuserlist is written in Livescript and compiled with Webpack.

dist will contain the unpacked extension.|||
