It’s been almost a month and a half since we officially started MaaxMarket. We had lot of customers who expressed interest in our product. One customer in particular, a network of hospitals, specifically asked us to meet them in person for an in person demo. Obviously the team here at MaaxMarket was very excited – “OMG! A customer is asking us to come and meet them.”

On the day of the meeting

The MaaxMarket team arrived 15 mins early to the meeting. However the meeting started 45 mins late 🙁 The person who was supposed to meet us came and escorted us to the meeting room where we were able to setup our demo we began introducing each other. After those formalities were done, I started to explain the product in detail. There were 8 people from their team, 6 from marketing and 2 from their sales team. I was talking about marketing automation and how personalized communication with patients was going to help the Hospital with reinforced brand recognition in the industry. After I completed the demonstration, I started taking questions from their team and that’s when the conversation got interesting.

Note: The hospital did not have a marketing automation solution in place before. This is the first time they are planning to deploy a marketing automation product.

Sales vs Marketing – Let the Fight Begin

The first question was from the ‘Head of Sales’ – “How can your product get me more sales?” and he added “Let’s say I am investing $500 in your product how much sales should I expect.”

We were startled by those questions. What we have is a marketing automation product and it helps them to personalize their communication with their patients. How can it drive more sales for a hospital? I was thinking hard and we weren’t ready for that question. Before I started to answer that question, there was another question coming: “Does your product give me leads?”

All the above questions were from a completely different dimension, sales, and our team wasn’t ready for them.

I then slowly explained to them what the product actually does. I acknowledged that our product does not directly give them leads or promise any sales. However it does help them to establish brand value in the market by having a personal touch with their patients through various avenues of communication like email and social media. It helps them to nurture leads (patients) who are looking for superior health care by constantly engaging them through email and social media. These engagements are not just random or generic engagements. These are personalized engagements based on their online behavior (pages they visited, whitepapers downloaded, emails opened / clicked, etc.).

Once when a new lead (patient) is looking for information on the web and has landed on their website to fill out a form, the process of lead nurturing starts. When the lead is nurtured they are then handed over to the sales team and sales can engage with prospects who have a greater chance of conversion. From a sales point of view, they already have the customer information. The sales team will communicate with the customers (even if delayed) and close the sales.

Why is there a need for marketing automation and lead nurturing?

From the marketing point of view, marketing teams are going to nurture the leads in order to captivate them and keep them interested which will eventually lead customers to buy the product. Why is there a sales team? What is a sales guy even doing in a hospital? 🙂 …Just kidding, we know why.

While I was having this discussion, I was able to sense a difference of opinion between marketing and sales. The ultimate question that the entire team was fighting over was, who wants to take credit for the Hospital’s increased revenue – marketing or sales?

The agenda of the meeting quickly changed from the Hospital trying our MaaxMarket product to which team is superior – marketing or sales.

After 2 hours of debate and multiple rounds of discussion, the entire team was convinced that increased revenue was possible because of the equal contribution from sales and marketing. It is the job of marketing to increase demand generation and brand value to change the perception of the market to like the service or product. Once when the prospect is interested and nurtured, it is the job of sales to effectively address the demand and close the sales.

After this debate was settled, we gave a fresh demo of MaaxMarket and told them exactly how it helps their leads and customers to get personalized communication thereby increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. They loved it.

MaaxMarket offers a solution that can be used in a wide variety of industries. businesses are dynamic and no two are alike; they way they utilize and view sales and marketing differs greatly from one another. We learned that our marketing  automation product can act as a constant and leverage the infrastructures in place in order to help deliver better experiences all around. Even though businesses define their own marketing and sales protocols, the core values remain the same, and that’s where MaaxMarket comes in.

The Hospital was happy to try our private BETA which is scheduled to be released on Oct 20th 2015.
