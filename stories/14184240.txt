IIS Crypto 2.0 introduces the ability to create your own custom templates which can be saved and then executed on any number of servers. To create your own template, select all of the settings for your configuration. Click on the Templates button and give your template a name, author and description if desired. Then click on the Save button to save your template to disk. Copy your template to another server, run IIS Crypto and click on the Open button to load your template. You can also use it from the command line version of IIS Crypto.

Load the Best Practices template before you start customizing your own template to ensure your template is setup securely.

If your template is in the same folder as IIS Crypto it will show up automatically in the drop down box without having to click the Open button first.|||
