Last time I sat to write this blog post I ended up writing a story about the borderline abusive nature of some of the kits and tools engineers use, ironically supplied to us by semiconductor companies who would like us to evaluate, and develop with, their components. My point was going to be that as an industry we can do much better in this area and here I'll describe how.

If there was semiconductor heaven, companies would get as many multi-million-unit orders as they can handle with the minimum amount of pre-sale costs and minimum support (also 100% yields, their own fab, and no distributors, but perhaps even heaven cannot manage that!)|||
