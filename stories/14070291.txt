No monkey, not walking on all fours. This is how the story of the Mowgli girl found in a forest at Uttar Pradesh has turned out. She was found at the Katerniaghat forest by head constable Sarvajeet Yadav two and half months back. The girl has now been shifted to the Lucknow's Nirvan Hospital for the mentally challenged.

On January 24, following a call the police rushed to rescue the girl. The girl was wearing a frock. She was very weak and tried moving away from the police team, Yadav explained. There were no monkeys, she was not naked and was not walking on all fours, the head constable further said.

It is now becoming clear that she was abandoned by her parents because she was mentally challenged. Yadav says that he does not know how the monkey story was spread. It is a clear case where a child due to mental illness was abandoned, Yadav further said.

When they found her, she was dragging herself to walk. This was because she was too weak. She had not eaten in days after she had been abandoned. After being found she was taken first to the police station and food was given to her. Following this, the police then admitted her to a hospital.|||
