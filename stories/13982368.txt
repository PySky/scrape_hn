We recommend that you allow inbound traffic only from your own IP addresses, you can easily change these using AWS security rules even after instance has started. When deploying/running on remote Ubuntu machines on VPS services such as Linode etc. beware of the Docker/UFW firewall issues . Docker bypasses UFW firewall and opens the port 8000 to internet. You can change the behavior by using a loopback interface (127.0.0.1:8000:80) and then forwarding the port (8000) over SSH tunnel, an example of this is shown here|||
