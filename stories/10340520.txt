Starting in Firefox 41, Mozilla provides a developer tool that allows users to inspect the security settings of a website. Using GCLI (Graphic Command Line Interface) a user can inspect the Content Security Policy (CSP) of a website. CSP is a security concept that allows websites to protect themselves against cross-site scripting (XSS) and related attacks. CSP allows website authors to whitelist approved sources from which content can be loaded safely. Browsers enforce that Content Security Policy header and only allow whitelisted resources to be loaded into that website. The CSP inspection tool lists all whitelisted sources.

The main intention behind CSP is to protect websites against XSS attacks, but the protection needs to be deployed in a way that allows support for legacy code on these sites. For example, the keyword ‘unsafe-inline’ was originally introduced to support legacy inline scripts while transitioning sites to use CSP. This keyword whitelists all inline scripts for a site, but it also allows attacker-injected scripts to execute, making CSP ineffective against most XSS attacks. Hence, the CSP devtool not only lists all whitelisted sources, but also provides a rating for each whitelisted source, to indicate the level of protection.

Inspecting the Content Security Policy as well as the Referrer Policy is only the starting point to providing end users with more feedback about the security and privacy settings a web page uses. We hope to add more tools in the future to give users more transparency and control over the security and privacy of the websites they visit.|||
