According to sci-fi, Robocop won’t police the streets until 2043. But today artificial intelligence is already cracking down on crime.

That’s because supercomputer IBM Watson is being used to keep our bankers in-line.

Insider trading, where the banking elite misuse privileged information to make money, used to take place over the phones.

Now though, bad bankers are using instant messaging systems to share insider secrets.

That’s why IBM has created a Watson Financial Services product – to analyse emails, chats and trading data for suspicious activity.

While current digital tools can flag suspicious words, Watson’s complex data analysis reads patterns, and could even spot tip-offs written in code, IBM claims. Its deep understanding of language should also result in fewer ‘false positives’ – when innocent transactions are flagged.

Already the tool is being piloted by a handful of financial industry clients, Bridget van Kralingen, a VP of IBM Industry Platforms told The Wall Street Journal.

It’s also hoped the smart surveillance will be able to assist in other areas of business – one feature, for example, is capable of reading the financial rulebook and assessing regulatory text to ensure a company is following them.

“I think about it like a detective that can do problem solving, rather than just a search,” said van Kralingen.

Desperate times call for digital innovation, and IBM Watson is stepping up.|||
