Big data: Hot on the minds of todayâ€™s organizations, big data provides vast opportunities to gain a competitive advantage across multiple industries. But finding professionals with the necessary skills to build fail-safe and scalable capabilities that will produce valuable insights and opportunities can be a challenge.

At Google, we want to make it easier for adopters of data analytics to get results quickly. At the same time, we want to help data engineers acquire the skills they need to be as valuable as possible to those employers.

To help tackle this challenge, we opened registration for Google Data Engineer Certification on May 2, 2017. This certification identifies technical professionals who can support decision-makers by helping them to understand and evaluate data in the right context, at the right time. Holding this certification verifies that you have the experience to design for value, scalability, reliability and compliance.
