Before designing these cards, we researched everything from the history of cards, traditional card symbolism (what even is a Jack, anyway?), and the style elements used in a classic deck of playing cards.

Then we started dreaming up ways to make the deck feel like our own. What could we change up about the traditional deck that might better reflect who we are and what we value? Heroku is such a developer-focused company, it only made sense that our face cards should feature developers rather than the typical medieval royalty. After all, developers are the new kingmakers.

We wanted our cards to reflect both the diversity of languages our platform supports as well as the diversity of the individuals working on it. So we set about thinking of ways we could express these ideas in the cards.|||
