WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Congresswoman Jacky Rosen (NV-03) released the following statement after introducing her first bill, H.R. 1868, the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which will reverse the Congressional resolution signed by President Trump allowing internet providers to sell their customers’ personal information without their knowledge or consent. The Congresswoman released the following statement after introducing her bill on the House floor:

“As someone who has first-hand experience as a computer programmer, I know that keeping privacy protections in place is essential for safeguarding vulnerable and sensitive data from hackers,” said Congresswoman Jacky Rosen.

“I will not stand by and let corporations get access to the most intimate parts of people’s lives without them knowing and without consent. It is appalling that Republicans and President Trump would be in favor of taking American’s most personal information to sell it to the highest bidder. I am proud to stand up for the American people by introducing legislation to reverse this misguided resolution.”

S.J. Res. 34 passed the House last week and was signed by the President last night. The resolution negates the October 2016 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule to protect Americans’ personal information and internet browsing history, such as geolocation, personal medical records, financial information, and other private data from being sold to advertisers and other third parties without their knowledge and require internet service providers (ISPs) to take reasonable measures to protect consumers from hackers. Rep. Rosen’s bill, the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, would reinstate the October 2016 FCC rule, effectively reversing S.J. Res 34.|||
