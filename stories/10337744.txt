What would you do if you were stuck in a video game? Well, that’s what the misfits of AFK have to figure out.

The new trailer for the video game web series, AFK, has finally hit the web. AFK (Internet slang for Away from Keyboard) is .hack//SIGNS meets The Lord of the Rings meets The Breakfast Club.

From the mind of New Zealand-based filmmaker Peter Haynes, the series (originally crowd-funded through Kickstarter) is a fantasy comedy about a group of gamers who mysteriously wake up in the body of their characters in an online role-playing game (think World of Warcraft or League of Legends). An alpha male wakes up in a body of a petite woman, a girl becomes a tiny male gnome, and a teenage boy who finds himself in the body of a decrepit old man. And that’s only the icing on the cake.

The series stars a diverse group of Kiwi/New Zealand-based actors, including: Mia Pistorus (Spartacus: War of the Damned), Calum Gittins (The King’s Speech, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers), JJ Fong (Step Dave, Flat 3), Grae Burton (Shortland), Ravi Narayan (The Hobbit), Dallas Barnett (The Hobbit), Ivan Essin, and Hweiling Ow (Agent Anna).

The best part about the series though? It’s FREE to watch online. And free is always good.

Check out the trailer below, and let us know your thoughts!

Be sure to tune to AFK when it premieres on YouTube on Tuesday, November 6, 2015 (or November 5, 2015 for those of us in North America.)|||
