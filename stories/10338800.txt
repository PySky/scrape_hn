Heavy multi-tasking kills your concentration. All that tweets, emails, chat messages and lolcats ðŸ˜¼ staring back at you from the background. They strive for your attention. And you only have that much of it.

Donâ€™t let yourself drown in scores of open windows. Hiding, switching, looking for the right one, more hiding, more switching. Calm down, breathe in, breathe out, launch HazeOver and finally concentrate on what's youâ€™ve been up to.

HazeOver automatically highlights an active window or app when you switch windows. The less important things gently fade away in the background, helping increase your productivity.
