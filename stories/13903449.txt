I happened to trip across this subreddit: Functional 3D Printing and I was jazzed. I thought I would look for something cool on it to share with Hacker News, but a lot of this is just photos of something someone did plus a title. They aren't necessarily articles.So, the forum itself is cool. Thus this post directing you to it. I hope you enjoy it.Some good ones to check out:This subreddit made me think of the book: FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication|||
