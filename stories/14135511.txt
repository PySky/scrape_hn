If you've been thinking about subscribing to HBO so you can watch “Westworld,” “Game of Thrones” and other hit shows, AT&T is hoping a new promotion will lure you to its service.

The cellphone carrier announced Wednesday that it will throw in a subscription to HBO for free if you sign up for Unlimited Plus, AT&T's top-tier unlimited data plan.

The deal starts Thursday, and is eligible for new and existing AT&T customers. A single line on Unlimited Plus costs $90 a month, and it costs about $185 a month for four lines. Under the plan, customers receive 10 GB of mobile hotspot tethering, and online video can be streamed in high definition.

Unlimited Plus customers also will get the following benefits, according to AT&T: If you already subscribe to one of AT&T's TV services but don't have HBO, AT&T will add that channel to your package at no extra charge. If you are already paying for HBO, AT&T's promotion will cancel out those charges.

If you simply sign up for Unlimited Plus but choose not to add TV to your plan, customers will access their free HBO through the app for AT&T's streaming TV service, DirecTV Now — but won't be required to purchase a separate subscription for the app, according an AT&T customer representative.

AT&T has been positioning itself as the leading wireless carrier for mobile video, aggressively promoting its streaming TV service, DirecTV Now. To entice its subscribers to add TV service, for example, AT&T offers its Unlimited Plus customers a $25 discount on DirecTV.

With rivals such as Verizon rumored to be planning streaming TV services, it's no surprise to see AT&T trying to make the most of its early-mover advantage.|||
