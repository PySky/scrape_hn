Earlier this month, Ride Share Drivers United asked Uber drivers to log off their apps for a day over poor pay and working conditions, safety issues, and the company's failure to respond to its concerns.

At the time, an Uber spokesman said drivers had the opportunity to raise their concerns during regular roundtable meetings.

The RSDU is asking for a base fare of $2.50 and a minimum total fare of $9 after previously saying some drivers are earning just $11 an hour after expenses and before income tax or superannuation.

Safety concerns such as long hours have also been raised.

The organisation says its letter has been received by Uber, but ignored. It is now looking into "intensifying and prolonging disruptions".

"Uber has failed to provide an acceptable response to any of our demands. Almost two months later and the base rates in Melbourne are still at very low, unsustainable levels," RSDU spokesman Max B said in a statement.

"Working conditions are still poor and in very strong contrast to Australian safety and minimum wage laws/standards."

Uber has been contacted for comment.|||

Melbourne Uber drivers will be urged to ramp up protests against poor pay and working conditions over the coming weeks.
