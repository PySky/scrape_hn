This is the third best Alien movie after the first two, but donâ€™t be surprised if repeat viewings kick it up a notch.|||

I received a letter that ends, as far as I am concerned, the discussion about 3D. It doesn't work with our brains and it never will. 

The notion that we are asked to pay a premium to witness an inferior and inherently brain-confusing image is outrageous. The case is closed.

This letter is from Walter Murch,  seen at left, the most respected film editor and sound designer in the  modern cinema. As a editor, he must be intimately expert with how an image interacts with the audience's eyes.  He won an Academy Award in 1979 for his work on "Apocalypse Now," whose sound was a crucial aspect of its effect.
