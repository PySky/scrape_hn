At their core, Read It Later applications, such as Pocket and Instapaper bookmark the things we want to come back to, whenever and wherever we’d like. Of course The Internet Needed a Save Button, but what is actually needed changes over time. In 2007, a list view solution, synchronization on different platforms and offline reading was a great experience transformation of how we managed content on the internet, for a signle-player mode.

It seems like, we moved the problem from ‘I want to save web content to read it later and can’t’ to ‘yes, but I want working on it later experience, individually and collaboratively with others’.

Listening to users won’t tell you what to build. But it will tell you where all the gaps are, and then the team’s creativity can go to work. Pocket left unanswered the gaps(popular feature requests) and made its users and me sad, like this. After it raised Series B, back to 2015, it became clear that their focus has been shifting over time to somewhere else — the discovery and accessibility of high quality web content or essentially on a content recommendation service that serves sponsored pieces to people whom the company determines would be interested in them. While Instapaper do more great things on web content consumption experience and listened to its customers — provide folder support, Highlights, Notes and such, it still left collaboration problem aside, yet.|||
