It is hard to maintain a regular internet uptime with home connections. 1⁄ router re-connections per week can be fairly common. When that happens, the public IP changes with most ISPs. This can be annoying if you want access your computer remotely (possibly to SSH home). Dynamic DNS is a solution that exists to solve just that.

I maintain DNS entries for my domain at Clouflare. The latest version of supports Cloudflare API, which works well with my ArchLinux box. But ddclient bundled with Raspbian, is yet to get that update. Cloudflare’s API is fairly straight forward, so I decided to use a curl/systemd based solution on my RaspberryPi.

If you too want to set Dynamic DNS with Cloudflare, you need to acquire some configuration information first:

I use with OpenDNS to get the current public IP and https://www.ipify.org/ as a fallback if isn’t installed. Using is faster though and you can install it via (available as an official package on most systems).

All the above information can now be plugged in this bash script to update the DNS entry on Cloudflare. I placed it at

Try running to see if DNS records get updated on Cloudflare. For debugging purposes, I store the Cloudflare response at .

We’ll automate this execution by writing a systemd service and a timer.

My systemd service unit looks like this:

Set up a timer, so that DNS update is attempted every 2 minutes:

And that’s it, now the system’s IP will be kept up to date (within 2 minutes) for remote access.|||
