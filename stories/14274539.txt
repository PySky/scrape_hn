Databrewer let you search and discover datasets. Inspired by Homebrew, it creates and index of known datasets that you can download with a single command. It will provide an API to allow to do the same in, for example, a IPython notebook so you no longer have to manually download datasets.

Datasets are defined in recipes which contains information about the dataset and where to find it.

These recipes are community maintained and hosted in the databrewer-recipes repository.
