People, I have an issue. I‚Äôm sorry to put it this way, but there seems ( according to me) to be a core problem with F#. The problem is that there seems to not be a standard definition of what idiomatic F# is and / or looks like.

I‚Äôve looked around the web and went around Microsoft‚Äôs docs (which are average at best) and only found an official style guide that is too simple. See, the issue is that I come from a Python background. In Python, you are shown how to and how not to do things. Which is really useful when it comes to keeping things sane between code bases. F# seems to be lacking such documentation. Which, to be honest, makes learning the language harder.

Every time I learn a new language, I focus on learning the idioms as part of the process. That way I can visit Github and read some code (to get a sense of how it‚Äôs written). Doing that with F# is an exercise in frustration because everyone seems to have a different opinion. Some say use . Others tell you to avoid it and use because it‚Äôs idiomatic. There seem to not be a consensus.

Am I missing something? Please send me an email, post on my Facebook group, or tweet at me with an answer. üëç
