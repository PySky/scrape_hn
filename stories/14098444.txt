Amazon is on pace to become the first $1 trillion company.

Watch as two industry experts discuss how Amazon became the largest online retailer in the US, and what it will take to slow them down. Amazon has continued to grow 20 percent every year for many years now, and has started to swallow up industries no one has thought about before - like becoming one of the largest fashion retailers.

Join the conversation about whether Amazon is untouchable, or whether competitors -- or even the government -- could potentially slow it down.

Talk to start promptly at 7PM -- networking to follow in the Cafe & Lounge.|||
