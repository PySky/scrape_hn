The Daily Mail recently shared symbols or codes used by pedophiles to communicate with each other within social networks. The Daily Mail, says it best, “The seemingly innocuous pastel-colored scrawls feature butterflies, love hearts, and spirals. These are the symbols pedophiles use to signal their sordid sexual preferences.”

The five symbols originally released to law enforcement nationwide by the FBI in 2007. A web search about the symbols will reveal a number of innocent uses of the symbols, e.g. on apparel, toys, etc. These are not symbols unique to pedophiles, but are used by pedophiles.

Context is important.  If you encounter/observe these symbols (see below) being used in a social network, bulletin board or other private group, you may wish to contact your local law enforcement or your local FBI.

In addition to the symbols, the FBI released in 2011, shorthand codes used by children when communicating with their online “friend.” They use these codes when their parents are nearby.

-PAW or PRW: Parents are watching

 – PIR: Parents in room

 – POS: Parent over shoulder

 – P911: Parent emergency

 – (L)MIRL: (Let’s) meet in real life
