This class is an introduction to the practice of deep learning through the applied theme of building a self-driving car. It is open to beginners and is designed for those who are new to machine learning, but it can also benefit advanced researchers in the field looking for a practical overview of deep learning methods and their application.

Support for this course was provided by the good folks at MIT-SUTD and the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program. The prizes for the competition were provided by our friends and fellow self-driving car engineers at Udacity. And none of it would be possible without the great community of bright young minds at MIT and beyond.|||
