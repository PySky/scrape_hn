Rush is still in an early state!

This means it is unstable and should not be used in production!

 It currently still lacks some features compared to bash, especially regarding built-ins and syntactic features.

Only the most-used shell built-ins are implemented with the most-used/most-needed command-line options and their behavior might also differ from bash at the moment in some cases.

Mostly for fun, but I'd also like to see it evolve into a full-baked shell which can be used on a daily basis.

This command will download, compile and place it in .
