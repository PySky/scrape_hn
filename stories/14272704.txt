Programmatically set the keyboard & display brightness on macs with built-in backlit keyboards.

This was mostly copied from @tcr's repo, just repackaged for ease of use. I had trouble finding any other easy-to-use binary for controlling keyboard brightness, so I made one.

Pass a float between 0-1 to the command to set brightness, or no args to get the current brightness.

You should be able to download the repo and use the binaries without needing to recompile anything (tested on macOS Sierra).

It's fun. Here are some ideas:

If you want to write more advanced programs to update the brightness at higher frequencies (e.g. to make your keyboard flash to music), you can use the C functions directly.|||
