Funny research paper co-authored by Daniel J. Bernstein, "Post-quantum RSA", explores potential "parameters for which key generation, encryption, decryption, signing, and verification are feasible on todayâ€™s computers while all known attacks are infeasible, even assuming highly scalable quantum computers".

 Funny part is that the actual parameters are "really" practical. Example: "For the 2Tb (256GB) encryption, the longest multiplication took 13 hours, modular reduction took 40 hours, and in total encryption took a little over 100 hours."
