Envoy is a new high performance open source proxy which aims to make the network transparent to applications. Envoy's out of process architecture allows it to be used alongside any language or runtime. At its core, Envoy is an L4 proxy with a pluggable filter chain model. On top of the L4 proxy it also includes a full HTTP stack with a parallel pluggable L7 filter chain. This programming model allows Envoy to be used for a variety of different scenarios including HTTP/2 gRPC proxying, MongoDB filtering and rate limiting, etc. Envoy includes advanced load balancing support including eventually consistent service discovery, circuit breakers, retries, zone aware load balancing, etc. Envoy also has best in class observability using both statistics and distributed tracing. 



In this talk we will cover Lyft's architectural migration from monolith to a fully distributed service mesh, the origins of Envoy, a high level architecture overview, and future directions.
