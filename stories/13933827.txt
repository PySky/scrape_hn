A patch can be applied from the clipboard (when the IDE obtains focus), or by dragging a file into the IDE.

If a file has been moved or renamed since a patch was created for it, the IDE will try to figure that out or let you manually choose the file to apply the patch to.

In case the file has been changed since a patch was created for it, but IntelliJ IDEA cannot find its original revision, you'll be prompted to apply the patch using a Merge-like dialog.

Also, the Apply Patch dialog provides the Show Diff action to compare the patch to your local version. While comparing, you can edit your the local version.|||
