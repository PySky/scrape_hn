Robots for Humanity (R4H) is about using technology to extend our capabilities, fill in our weaknesses, and let people perform at their best. Henry Evans is the inspiration and instigator of R4H. Henry suffered a tragic stroke when he was 40 years old, rendering him mute and quadriplegic. Through robotic technology, Henry continues to find ways to explore and interact with the world. Devices developed by members of Robots for Humanity thus far range from an interactive laser mounted on his glasses, to a very expensive humanoid robot (PR2) which serves as Henry's body surrogate, to various flying quad rotors. This site tells the story of Henryâ€™s quest to inspire engineers the world over to devote part of their time developing innovative ways for disabled people to interact with the world. Early and consistent collaborators and co-founders include Dr. Kemp from The Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech, Steve Cousins/Willow Garage, and Henry's wife, Jane, without whom R4H would not have been possible.|||
