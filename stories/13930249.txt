TclForth uses Tcl/Tk as its native language. The Forth source code is compiled to Tcl procedures for execution in the Tcl run time system. Tcl commands and Forth words coexist as a symbiosis of Tcl and Forth.

TclForth is provided in two versions.

The executables are Tcl Starpacks with TclForth version 0.6.0.

The executables for Windows and OS-X contain a Tcl runtime and a load routine for the external TclForth source. This allows easy changes of the systems.|||
