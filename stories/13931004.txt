The Pirate Bay and several other pirate sites are unavailable again in many parts of the world, due to a new blockade from Internet backbone provider Cogent. The site's IP-addresses, which are owned by CDN provider Cloudflare, have been blackholed, in what appears to be another case of over-blocking.
