4YFN - four years from now is a energetic and buzzling show in Barcelona with young people, startups and a lot of energy. I think the best activity of the Mobile World Congress. We interview the participants with one question, where they will be 4YFN.





From the 4YFN website:

 

4YFN is the startup business platform of Mobile World Capital Barcelona that enables startups, investors, corporations and public institutions to discover, create and launch new ventures together.



4YFN offers unique connecting initiatives, such as custom networking activities, technical abilities workshops, congresses, community outreach and open innovation programmes.



We believe that the startup culture is the driving force for change in the economic and social fabric and, of course, Barcelona being a global tech hub is the ideal location for such creation and nurture.
