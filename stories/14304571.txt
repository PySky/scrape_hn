I recently received news that my Google Summer of Code 2017 proposal has been accepted. So I thought I should write a series of posts as this summer passes to chronicle my experience with the program. This first post is an outline of the process I followed in creating a successful proposal; I hope future applicants - or those just curious - find these tips helpful.

My project this summer will be to develop a content management and presentation suite utilizing Physical Web technology. The novel concept behind the Physical Web project is to utilize web Bluetooth to allow interactions with inexpensive physical beacons from the browser - in other words, IOT without the hassle of apps. My task is to develop an Android app (and an accompanying web app) to enable exhibitors, museums and the like to organize galleries that use these beacons. Visitors will then receive a notification when they unlock their phones, which will lead them to the webapp that displays media relevant to the exhibit piece they are looking at. Find the official description here. You can find the final text of my proposal here.

Before we get any further, I would like to extend my thanks to Andreu Ibáñez and Julio Bondia (from the Physical Web team) for their thorough proposal feedback and their patience with my questions. None of this would have been possible without their help!|||
