Whenever I have some time to spare there are a few websites that come to my mind to visit. There are two websites which hit the top of this list, Product Hunt and Unsplash.

Unsplash is a website dedicated to sharing copyright-free photography under the Creative Commons zero license, which means do-whatever-you-want with the photos.

Launched back in 2013, Unsplash is a site which posts ten handpicked photos every ten days and these photos are absolutely free. Today, over 3 photos are downloaded per second on Unsplash. In three and a half years, Unsplash has become one of the fastest-growing, most impactful photography communities.
