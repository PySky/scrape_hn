SwiftyOnboardDataSource protocol has the following methods:

Return the number of items (pages) in the onboarding.

Return a view to be displayed as the background of the onboarding.

Return a view (page) to be displayed at the specified index in the onboarding.

Return an overlay (view) to be displayed on top of the onboarding pages. e.g. [The continue and skip buttons which don't move with the pages, also included is the page control]

Edit the overlay (view) for the desired position. e.g. [Change the "continue button" text to "Done", when the last page is reached]

Set the background color for the page at the given index. (Very useful when you have pages with different background colors)

SwiftyOnboardDelegate protocol has the following methods:

This method is called whenever a page is shown, it holds the index to that page. It is called regardless of whether the page was swiped programmatically or through user interaction.

This method is called whenever the pages are scrolling, it holds the current distance between the left side of the screen and the left side of the first page.

This method is called whenever a page is tapped by the user, it holds the index of the tapped page.
