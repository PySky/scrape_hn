Just because you are at work, it doesn’t mean you’re getting work done!

Who isn’t familiar with the never ending email chains, the pointless meetings and the constant interruptions? These are the BIG productivity killers that you and your colleagues have to deal with every single day. They take up an average of 83 % of your day, which leaves you just 17 % of actually getting stuff done. Shocked? Yup, so are we.

Unnecessary activities and inefficient processes. This is the real reason to why people waste their time. A new research report in the UK, called “Unlocking the UK’s Daily Savings”, found out that 57 % of office workers spend an hour a day looking for missing documents and 20 % of them have to recreate these documents! Lack of planning and limited resources, were the factors identified for why people feel overwhelmed at work. This just shows how important it is to organize your tasks and to improve collaboration within your team for a better performance.

And the worst part is that after each one of these interruptions it takes 25 minutes to refocus on your original time. The time wasted is huge!

So, how can companies overcome this major problem? The key is to implement more effective, innovative and user friendly systems and processes. Time is gold and you want your employees to use it as efficiently as possible.
