This is a group of passionate Javascripters. We will get together at a coffee shop, someone's office or any other interesting place. The idea is to get excited by others experiences and excite others with our learning. Our motto could be - 'enough with the presentations... show me some code' :)

You can join us and discuss on our Slack, https://jschannel.slack.com/

For job related (looking for a job or looking for a candidate) purpose, you can directly send a mail to the group. We are working with couple of guys in the community to solve this recruitment demand & supply.
