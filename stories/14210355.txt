On a quiet Sunday morning in August, a Palo Alto, California, police car swept through the town picking up college students as part of a mass arrest for violation of Penal Codes 211, Armed Robbery, and Burglary, a 459 PC. The suspect was picked up at his home, charged, warned of his legal rights, spread-eagled against the police car, searched, and handcuffed â€“ often as surprised and curious neighbors looked on.

The suspect was then put in the rear of the police car and carried off to the police station, the sirens wailing.|||
