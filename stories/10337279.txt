Whatever they're actually selling, many companies are pretty high-minded when it comes to crafting their official missions statements. Sure, they provide a product or service—but they also, more often than not, want to make the world a better place (allegedly).

Insurance company Unum collects 24 inspirational company mission statements in the infographic below, and they offer some interesting takes on the brands' self-perception. Many of them—Warby Parker, Nike, Google, Facebook, Ikea—are right on brand. Others, like Chevron, are a bit more peculiar. And a few—Coca-Cola and McDonald's jump right out—are way more aspirational than the products perhaps deserve.

Unum doesn't put itself on the list, perhaps wisely. Its statement is: "Unum's mission is to be the leading provider of employee benefits products and services that help employers manage their businesses and employees protect their families and livelihoods."|||
