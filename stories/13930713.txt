After 4 months of hard work, we are proud to announce a new release of Traefik: version 1.2.0, codename Morbier.

The full changelog can be found here but here are some new features we want to highlight:

Thanks to Luke Petre, Traefik now supports Amazon EC2 Container Service. This is a great news for AWS fans who need more than an ELB/ALB to manage their inbound traffic.

Finally, Traefik gets native Rancher support! Thank you Manuel Laufenberg! It is now a lot simpler to have a specific configuration backend right into Traefik.

A lot of people were waiting for it, thanks to Alberto Garcial, native Prometheus support is now real :) This allows you to export internal metrics to Prometheus using a simple flag . More internal metrics will be added soon!

Eureka is the service registry taken from the Netflix OSS stack. Traefik now supports Eureka as a configuration backend thanks to Julien Salleyron!

Another long awaited feature, healthchecks are here! Again, thanks to Julien Salleyron. A health check can be configured in order to remove a backend from LB rotation as long as it keeps returning HTTP status codes other than 200 OK.|||
