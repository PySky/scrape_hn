Creation Of The Food Stamps, Is going to be the topic for today’s post, the stamps was a program signed into law by President John F. Kennedy in February 1964 just right after he took office the food stamp program was an executive order, that made a big difference in a lot of people’s lives and I can remember hearing them talk about what a change and a difference president Kennedy had made.

Before the food stamps that was commodity programs which handed out cheese powdered milk peanut butter and canned beef, and president Kennedy made an announcement to ship that stuff overseas and places where it was needed, and that’s when the food stamps was signed into law, president Kennedy said to give people something that they could buy nourishing food and food that they really like.

They were different stations set up back through the late 60s into the very early 70s which food stamps was handed out to the people who was eligible for them, and I can remember seeing lines of people-half of mile long or longer, standing in line to get there month supply of food stamps, sometimes they wouldn’t be enough time in the eight hours, shifts of work for the people at the booth who was handed out the stamps, some people in line had to go and come back the next day.

Then in the early 1970s which I think was about 1973 the food stamps then was sent by mail to the people who was eligible for them which was even a bigger help, and then in the mid-1990s the food stamps were changed from a dollar bill look to the form of a debit card and is added each month electronically.

Not content to wait for Congress, his first Executive Order in February (among many other things) re-instituted a “pilot” food stamp program based on the Depression-era model. After Kennedy’s assassination, President Johnson requested Congress to make the program permanent. They did in 1964.
