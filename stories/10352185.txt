When we talk about space, it’s easy to get ahead of ourselves. Though there’s not as much money going into NASA anymore, there’s still plenty of innovation in the field of space research.

Many people may not know it, but space research includes cleantech. A little bit of Googling, and you’ll find that there’s quite a bit of talk — and R&D — about the potential for space-based solar power generation. That is, after a few decades, a few billion dollars, and a few new technological discoveries, of course.

It’s all a bit far-fetched, but it’s fun to imagine. Check out these seven facts about space-based solar power.

1. NASA has been talking about solar power in space for decades.

Since the 1970s, to be exact. It was a decade after Apollo 11 landed on the moon, and NASA planned to build a space-based solar factory because of the energy crisis on Earth, and because they were dreaming pretty big at the time. Of course, it never came to fruition, but the idea that NASA could do something for cleantech and in the solar arena lingers.

2. There’s a new technology that cools solar panels by reflecting heat into the universe.

The more heat solar panels absorb, the less efficient they become. So Stanford researchers came up with a new technology: a thin layer of silica that overlays on solar cells that captures and emits thermal radiation from infrared rays, into space, to cool them off and boost efficiency. According to a statement from Stanford, when the overlay was tested, it cooled the absorber up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit.|||
