An early look at artificial Intelligence. Guests includes Edward Feigenbaum of Stanford University, Nils Nilsson of the AI Center at SRI International, Tom Kehler of Intellegenetics, Herb Lechner of SRI, and John McCarthy of Stanford. Featured demonstrations include Inferential Knowledge Engineering and the programming language LISP. Originally broadcast in 1984. Copyright 1984 Stewart Cheifet Productions.

A fascinating glimpse at A.I. in its prime, including interviews with some of the most powerful intellects in the history of computing. YOU EVEN GET TO SEE A REAL LISP MACHINE IN OPERATION!!!! Unfortunately, this trip into the ultimate ivory tower is interrupted by cheerleading for unjustifiably popular primitive computing devices, the lasting influence of which continues to interfere with the advancement of the entire computing industry today.

The first 3/4 of it is watchable but very static. The liveliest bits are buried at the end in a separate computing news program called 'Random Access' that seems to have slipped into the main clip. 'Random Access' features gems like a perky report that IBM PC sales are surprizingly brisk, and an ominous (with hindsight) note that Compaq is lowering the price of its clones below IBM's price.
