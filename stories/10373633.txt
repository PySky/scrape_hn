GRID has been broadly adopted in the Digital Science portfolio companies to facilitate data exchange, increase functionality, and support novel features. We think these benefits should be shared more widely in the scientific community to foster innovation and increase interoperability.

No yearly fees, no complex licensing agreements, no hassle. GRID is completely free to use, however if you have time we would love to hear what you build with it!|||
