Binge eating disorder is a mental illness where people experience a loss of control and overeat on a regular basis.

Also called compulsive eating, emotional eating or overeating, binge eating episodes are associated with eating rapidly, eating when not hungry, eating alone and feeling disgust or extreme guilt after overeating.

For iPM programe, reporter Becky Milligan visited a unique therapy group which brings binge eaters together to talk openly about the mental health problems at the root of their food consumption.|||
