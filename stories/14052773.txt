It's unfortunately not as simple as just putting it back together and hearing a nice "click" as it comes into place. I ended up having to super glue it shut. If you decide to do it, keep in mind that difficulty grade is about 7/10 here due to careful plastic work. Also note that for twice the price, you can buy yourself a new charger, so it may be an option to consider. Check out my programming blog: https://goo . gl/jHe6np|||
