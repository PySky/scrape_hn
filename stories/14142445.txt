This will be a super-quick post about something that came up at least twice in the last few months within the Erlang community. It’s related to the syntax of maps within a list.

Quick question: how many maps do we have in the following list?

People following the erlang-questions mailing list might know already, but the correct answer is not 3, nor a compile error. It’s 2.

Well, there is a missing comma in the second row.

Because what’s written there is a perfectly valid expression, of course. And it matches the syntax used for records, as it’s pointed out in this thread:

that function on the shell returns a list with 2 elements, as expected…|||
