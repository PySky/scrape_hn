So, your page doesn’t load as quickly as you’d like? And you have tried everything in your power to get the best load time?

You need to realize that page speed optimization as you know is pretty simple when stripped to its skeleton. I’m not going to throw too much technical jargon at you, mostly because the technical aspect is not of *paramount* importance.

Well, for starters, it gives your readers a hassle free experience. Nobody likes reloading the page twice because it’s taking too long to load. They might as well check your competitor out. If this is not reason enough to convince you, note that Google primarily prefers pages that load quickly over pages that take ages to load.

This is tricky. You wouldn’t have installed a plugin in the first place if you didn’t need it. What I’m asking you to do is; strip down to the absolute basics. Don’t go around installing plugins for trivial things that can be done by adding a couple of lines of code. Use only those plugins which you think are pivotal to your blog’s running.

Let’s take ‘Jetpack‘ for instance. I have nothing against Jetpack but it happens to be one of those plugins that drastically increases your page loading time. I’m not suggesting that you don’t need it. You probably do. But then, is it worth the trade-off? Does Jetpack make your blog sassier? Does it provide insights that are of unspeakable importance to your blog? No? Then why do you have it installed? Like I said, I have nothing against Jetpack. Ask yourself the same questions before deciding to do away with a plugin. But I strongly suggest you get rid of Jetpack.

You just re-designed your blog, and it looks better than ever. You’ve never been happier with your design and aren’t planning on changing it anytime soon. Do you still have every other theme you ever installed in your Dashboard? GET RID OF THEM! They dramatically take a toll on your page load time and not in a positive manner.

Why? For the simple reason that it has got options that will make your life easier. You get access to features that can save you a lot of time while optimizing your page speed. And promise, it doesn’t affect your load time too much. 🙂 Why only this plugin? It happens to be the best plugin in the market in this space right now.

Your images consume a huge chunk of your loading time. What can you do about that? Well, there’s a fix. Install WP-Smush. This plugin essentially decreases the effect images have on your page loading speed. The best part? You get to delete it after its job is done.

This plugin deletes all of the junk that you’ve managed to amass over the months and years. Don’t worry; it removes nothing of importance. This plugin can boost your loading time by quite a bit. You can get rid of this plugin when its job is done too.

This is where it gets a tad bit too technical for newbies to handle. So, do this only if you’re somewhat experienced and know what you’re doing.

Cloudflare is a CDN (Content Delivery System). I’ll google that for you – “A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver web pages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the web page and a content delivery server.” Saved you some time, eh? 🙂

Well, Cloudflare happens to be the market leader and is pretty reasonably priced. And the best part is, you have both the free and the paid variants. So, you can always choose the free one, see if it works for you. It has some amazing features. You should check it out here.|||
