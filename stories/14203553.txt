So this week’s question can I get a traffic ticket if my cars exhaust is smoking in New York would fall under new York states vehicle and traffic law under section 375 which deals with passenger vehicle equipment which is safety related. You will find the answer under section 375 subsection 28 which states that no person shall operate upon a public highway a vehicle which emits unnecessary smoke or unnecessary offensive vapors. So yes…you could receive a ticket for it especially if your vehicle is doing this…take a look! 



Now if your vehicle looked like that I would seriously consider getting your vehicle serviced or take it off the road because if you run across this guy you’re not going to have a good day.
