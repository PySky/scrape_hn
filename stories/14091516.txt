Uber, AirBnB, Spotify.. these services are basically central hubs in domains that are basically solid candidates for decentralization. Each one of them can be (and probably will be) implemented on the Ethereum network, and scale will happen as soon as an App layer gets built for these services on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, hiding the complexity to the end user. Uber drivers just care about what percentage gets taken away from them, Period. Unlike Facebook, there is not much of “my network is there” with these services – money would get people to move at lightning speed.

What do these companies think about an Ethereum future? Hundreds of billions of dollars in value – basically for being effective middlemen – will they not be worried?
