Access to the Internet keeps on getting cheaper by the day in India, and BSNL's latest broadband plan is in keeping with that narrative.

Trying to boost broadband adoption and delight customers, BSNL announced a brand new “unlimited” wired broadband plan which not only offers attractive Internet offers but also voice-based telephony packs.

BSNL announced the new wired broadband plan on its Twitter profile. As part of its “unlimited wireline broadband plan,” BSNL customers will stand to enjoy 10GB of data daily at 2Mbps connectivity speed for just Rs 249 per month. That’s 1.2GB of data per Rupee, making it the most inexpensive BSNL broadband plan (with a minimum speed of 2Mbps) of all time!

Not only data, the new BSNL plan also offers unlimited voice calling on Sunday and unlimited night calling between 9pm to 7am -- not just on BSNL’s own network but on any telecom network operating within India.

Cellular Internet access rates have been falling down ever since the Reliance Jio juggernaut took off last year in September, Vodafone and Idea have merged to consolidate the market and offer attractive connectivity plans at record low prices.

It was only fair that wired broadband also came to the disruptive digital party, what with ACT Fibernet’s 1Gbps city-wide broadband in Hyderabad, the beta phase rollout of Jio Giga Fiber with speeds of 100Mbps, and now this BSNL announcement. It’s a great time to be a telecom customer trying to access the Internet in India!
