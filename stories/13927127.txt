7 Mar 2017 Sunnyvale, Yokneam - Mellanox ConnectX-5 Open Compute Project (OCP) Ethernet adapter will enable the world's first PCIe Gen-4 OpenPOWER/OCP-based Zaius, the open server platform from Google and Rackspace. Mellanox showcased ConnectX-5, the industry's first PCIe Gen-4 based 100Gb/s OCP Ethernet adapter at the OCP Summit, 2017.

The exponential growth of data demands not only the fastest throughput but also smarter networks. Mellanox intelligent interconnect solutions incorporate advanced acceleration engines that perform sophisticated processing algorithms on the data as it moves through the network. Intelligent network solutions greatly improve the performance and total infrastructure efficiency of data intensive applications in the Cloud such as cognitive computing, machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT). Mellanox's ConnectX-5 supports both InfiniBand and Ethernet, and is the most advanced 10/25/50/100Gb/s intelligent adapter on the market today. Additionally, as the first adapter to support PCIe Express Gen 4.0, ConnectX-5 delivers full 200Gb/s data throughput to servers and storage platforms.

The ConnectX-5 supports Multi-Host technology, delivering flexibility and major cost savings for the next generation of Cloud, Web2.0, Big Data and cognitive computing platforms. Multi-Host technology disaggregates the network and enables building new scale-out heterogeneous compute and storage racks with direct connectivity from multiple processors to shared network controller. Mellanox Multi-Host technology is available today in the Mellanox portfolio of ConnectX-4 Lx, ConnectX-4, and ConnectX-5 adapters at speeds of 50 and 100Gb/s.

"We anticipate that Zaius and our Barreleye G2 server solution will bring new levels of performance and efficiency to our portfolio", stated Aaron Sullivan, Distinguished Engineer, Rackspace. "This platform combines IBMÂ’s Power9 processor with PCI Express Gen4, and Mellanox ConnectX-5 network adapters. Leveraging these technologies, it is now possible to deliver hundreds of gigabits of bandwidth from a single network adapter."

"IBM, the OpenPOWER Foundation and its members are fostering an open ecosystem for innovation to unleash the power of cognitive and AI computing platforms", stated Ken King, IBM general manager of OpenPOWER. "The combination of the POWER processor and Mellanox ConnectX-5 technology, using novel interfaces like CAPI and OpenCAPI, will dramatically increase system throughput for the next generation of advanced analytics, AI and cognitive applications."

"Mellanox has been committed to OCP's vision from its inception and we are excited to bring continued innovation to this growing community", stated Kevin Deierling, vice president marketing at Mellanox Technologies. "Through collaboration between IBM and Rackspace, we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, enable open platforms and unlock performance of compute and storage infrastructure."|||
