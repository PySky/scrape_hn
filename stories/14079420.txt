Here is a global map of serverless meetups, although many more are being created every week. You can already find serverless meetups in Washington DC, Boston, Austin, Atlanta, Munich, Madrid, Vienna, Dublin, Oslo, Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, Auckland, Singapore, etc.

The thing I love the most about serverless meetups is their vendor neutrality, as you can often meet developers and engineers who love and work with very diverse technologies and platforms. For example, we've been talking about AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Apache OpenWhisk, Iron Functions, Webtask, Unitcluster, Firebase, Auth0, and more!

During the last twelve months, ServerlessConf has been growing a lot. New York, Tokyo, London (and Austin later this month) were such a great start, but I personally think that local meetups are indispensable to keep the conversation going and generate many more new ideas and use cases. In fact, I'm currently experimenting with services such as AWS Lambda@Edge and AWS Step Functions, which really open up new fascinating scenarios for the serverless crowd.

I am Alex Casalboni from Cloud Academy, I have been co-organizing Serverless Italy for a while, and this month I have planned a Serverless Tour around some of the biggest serverless meetups in Europe and the US. I started with London last week, and I will be in San Francisco on Apr 20th. I will be happy to meet you in Seattle or Austin as well, from Apr 15 to Apr 30.

Also, if you are new to serverless technologies (or FaaS, or Jeff) you can get started with some of my [free] webinars and coding sessions on Cloud Academy:

Let me know if you can meet me in Seattle, San Francisco or Austin this month, and feel free to share your personal experience with local serverless meetups! :)|||
