This is C++ FQA Lite. C++ is a general-purpose programming language, not necessarily suitable for your special purpose. FQA stands for "frequently questioned answers". This FQA is called "lite" because it questions the answers found in C++ FAQ Lite.

Note: some parts of the FQA are not up to date with C++11/14/17. You can contribute to the FQA on GitHub.

The structure of the Q&A pages corresponds to that of C++ FAQ Lite, and links are given to the original FAQ answers. Issues on many different scales are discussed. For a summary of the large-scale problems with C++, see Defective C++ and Big Picture Issues. A single page version of the Q&A is available here.|||
