WMImplant is a PowerShell based tool that leverages WMI to both perform actions against targeted machines, but also as the C2 channel for issuing commands and receiving results. WMImplant will likely require local administrator permissions on the targeted machine.

The easiest way to get up and running with WMImplant is to import the script and run Invoke-WMImplant. This will present you with the main menu and you can instantly start choosing a command to run. Within the main menu, you can also choose to have WMImplant output the command line command you would need to use in order to run WMImplant in a non-interactive manner.

This is a PowerShell based tool that is designed to act like a RAT. Its interface is that of a shell where any command that is supported is translated into a WMI-equivalent for use on a network/remote machine. WMImplant is WMI based.
