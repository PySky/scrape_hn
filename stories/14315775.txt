“Master LED ExpertColor GU10 and MR16 enable customers to create a warm and comfortable ambience with superior colour realisation using a patented light spectrum with advanced phosphor technology and deep dimming. The new range is aimed at providing a superior lighting experience for premium hospitality and residential spaces where ambience matters.”

What is going on is not clearly stated.

Apparently, for 2,700K spots, the spectrum is “over 94% identical to halogen light colour, compared to about 60% with standard LED lights”.

Following a request, Philips has clarified this (and sent the graph used above).

Our aim was to replicate 2,700K light colour with LED technology specially for premium spaces where superior light quality is required. We started by customising the LED component while applying advanced phosphor technology to achieve the right light colour.

 Spectrum analysis shows that its light colour spectrum is 94% identical to a halogen spot light’s spectrum. This value is the correlation value of the sum of similarities and differences in the visible spectrum range.

 When standard LED spots are compared to halogen spot lights, typically there is a difference of around 40%. This is mainly because standard LEDs usually have the blue or purple spectrum emphasised to create enough lumen output for practical use.

Update: Looks like efficacy is 62.5 lm/W in this dimmable MR16 (450 lm 7.2W).

Lifetime is said to be 40,000 hours.

The GU10 will be available in Europe from May 2017 and in Asia from July 2017.

The MR16 is available in Asia, will be available in North America from June 2017 and in Europe from September 2017.|||

Philips Lighting claims to produce "a light spectrum nearly identical to halogen" from what it calls its 'ExpertColor' technology. "Master LED ExpertColor
