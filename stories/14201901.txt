Let's pretend a medical breakthrough occurred, eliminating all "natural" causes of death. No more cancer, no more heart attacks, no more respiratory failures... how would that affect life expectancy?

Answer: it would increase from 78 years — today's average in the U.S. — to a much more impressive 8,938 years. This interactive visualization simulates human lives in an imaginary world where natural death does not occur. A graph below shows the probability statistics used for the simulation. A link is provided as well, showing the actuarial calculations.

Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of unnatural death in the U.S. by a wide margin. Self-driving cars could change this drastically once the technology is implemented on a wide-scale basis. That would potentially leave gun violence the top killer.|||

People would live over 8,000 years - on average - if natural death was eliminated
