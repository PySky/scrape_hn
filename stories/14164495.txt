- If necessary, you can preprocess your code with `gcc -E -P'. 

 - Our compiler is based on the C89 standard, with a few extensions. 

 - Variadic functions apart from those from the `printf' family are not yet supported. 

 - Only some of the C standard library functions have been implemented.|||
