We are proud to present that Kontist won the jury award “FinTech of the Year 2016” in the category Early Stage at the EXEC conference in Berlin.

What an achievement! Simultaneously, I see this as a confirmation that we are solving fundamental problems faced by many freelancers and SMEs - the financial transparency of their business and the automation of back-office tasks.

It is hard to get these services from classical banks. They do not understand the customer and struggle to offer the right service. Thus, many freelancers feel neglected by their bank, a feeling I have experienced myself for a long time!

Particularly well received was our intuitive accounting integration with Debitoor which automates most of the bookkeeping SMEs have to do. SMEs now receive the same convenient and advantageous service in terms of banking and taxation as employees do.

The jury explicitly praised that we have recognized this weakness and can therefore offer a tailor-made account for the self-employed as a solution.

As Kontist, we will continue the fight for the rights of freelancers.

We are very happy and thankful for the award. Coupled with the positive feedback we have received from our customers it shows us that we are on the right track!

Thanks to the high-caliber jury, consisting of experts in banking, payment & start-up, as well as industry experts. And thank you all for voting for us and supporting us! The prize means a lot to us!

2017 will be our year!|||
