I do not owe you any money. Honest. (it should become obvious)

At the end of my two year lease/contract, I took my phone to my local Sprint store to return it. I was told I must take it to a “corporate store” to turn it in.

I drive to Canton, Ohio to turn in the phone, and am told they no longer are allowed to accept phones. I must call and get a “return” authorization. I ask how to do that, and they offer to dial them up. I get a code and am told to allow 3 to 5 days for a “call tag” to arrive.

After I wait five days, I call Sprint. This is actually what happened:

I am told that they will issue me a new code and that I am to wait another 3 to 5 days for the call tag. I voice my concern over the delays and roadblocks. I stated that I DO NOT want to hear that I have been turned over to collection because of their misdirections and ineptitudes.

Call tag arrives, I send phone back. About five weeks later I receive a collection notice.

I call the collection agency to explain and complain. They call Sprint with me on the phone.

They now had it over a month and had failed to process it. Honest.

Last week I received a new letter from the collection agency.

P.S. Can you say, “Class Action Suit?” Anyone else experiencing this total lack of ethics?|||

Are you a victim of Sprint's lack of integrity? Can you say "class action suit?" Together, we might be able to correct this, but alone, I doubt it.
