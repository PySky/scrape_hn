Note the double square brackets. We can select a row from a data frame using an integer index, using the I location, or the I L-O-C function. In this case, we're selecting the row whose index is equal to two. The fruit associated with this row is pineapple, and the veggies associated with this row is peppers. We can select a range of rows by using an integer slice. In this case, we obtain the rows zero through one, up to, but not including, two.

 We can also use a slice to count backwards using negative numbers within the slice. In this example, we see that the plus symbol is overloaded as a concatenation operator when dealing with data frames. When we execute this cell, we see that apples is concatenated to each of the previous values in the fruit column.
