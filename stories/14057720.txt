Facebook will offer a free version of Workplace , its messaging service for businesses, that it hopes will challenge the hot rival Slack and the newer Microsoft Teams.

The new free version, announced by Facebook this week, joins a previously announced paid version that premiered last year.

Workplace is part a growing list of products trying to make it easier for business users to chat, share documents and photos with their select groups of their colleagues.

Facebook, which has nearly 2 billion users of its social networking site, has been trying to move more into business settings, where Microsoft ( msft ) , Google ( googl ) , and upstart Slack hold sway. As part of that push, Facebook recently announced a new feature for posting job notices that would compete with Microsoft's LinkedIn business unit, for example.

The free standard version will offer one-to-one and group voice and video calling, streaming video, and chat for people with Apple ( aapl ) iOS or Android devices as well as those on desktop PCs. It will not include IT administrative and monitoring features, like single-sign on, and integration with other business applications like Google ( goog ) G Suite.

Those features all available in Workplace's premium version, which costs either $1, $2, or $3 per active user per month based on total number of overall users, according to the company. The paid version is free till the end of September as a trial.

When the free version will be available is unclear. Facebook only said this week that it would be coming "soon."

A Facebook ( fb ) spokeswoman said the company hopes Workplace will connect everyone including people who only use mobile devices.|||
