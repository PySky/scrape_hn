In Loja province, Southern Ecuador and Peru border, many strange relics have been uncovered.

Bones and full skeletons very similar to those of humans but of incredible size.

SEVEN TIMES THE SIZE OF A MODERN HUMAN ​

These artifacts have been watched over for many years by several guardians in the beautiful valleys of that Province.

Several fragments were redirected to the Smithsonian Institution of the United States of America, for people to study their density, age, weight etc.

​This was broadcast on a television program for Ecuador, which lasted two hours, led by renowned director Alfonso Espinosa De Los Monteros. ​

Several other important relics and fragments are known to be in private collections, by people who are not interested in sharing them, at least not with the public.

From the aforementioned fragmented skeleton, seven fragments were studied by different scientists and anatomists, and they have confirmed, that they are part of a human skeleton that was seven times the size of a modern human
