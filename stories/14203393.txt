Have you been frustrated to find the right color for your website or any web UI?

Are you also like me who tried all the beautiful color palettes only to find they don't work for any thing except the palette itself?

We have some good news! CSSToucan, a deep learning model that can intelligently colors web page texts for you!

You can try it with your own HTML and CSS code below (sorry, only works in webkit based browsers like Chrome, Safari and Opera), or import any public web page with their URL (works on any browsers). For code rendering, notice that you need to specify CSS styles too as the example shows, otherwise there would be too little context for CSSToucan to guess the color. You can do it by either inlining your styles or use class names. The example uses inline style.
