ScatterFly is a program designed to make it harder for ISP's to sell or analyze your personal data by intelligently obfuscating it.

On March 29th the US congress passed a law that makes it legal for your Internet Service Providers (ISP) to track and sell your personal activity online. This means that things you search for, buy, read, and say can be collected by corporations and used against you. ScatterFly contaminates your data with the random websites it visits in an attempt to make it harder for them to analyze your data. source : https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h202

If you would like to run this project on a Linux server (like a Raspberry Pi) there are a few additional steps:

The difference between the above project and ScatterFly is that ScatterFly can be launched from your terminal and runs in the background meaning it doesnt open up a browser window or new tabs -- so it doesn't distract you from work or confuse you while it's running. ScatterFly also randomizes the time of each visit, so it's harder to differentiate the traffic.
