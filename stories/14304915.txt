President Donald Trump on Tuesday abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey in the fallout over Comey’s probe of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails last year, saying Comey was no longer able to effectively lead the agency. Jonah Green reports.

President Trump terminated the director of the bureau – while in the middle of a ten year term – at the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying Comey was no longer able to effectively lead the agency.

In a statement the President saying that “today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.”

This comes just days after Comey appeared before the Senate defending his handling of the Clinton email probe, adding – for the first time publically- that how it unfolded made him uneasy.

“This was terrible. It makes me mildly nauseous to think we might’ve had some impact on the election. But, honestly, it wouldn’t change the decision.”

And this week Comey under fire for including apparent false and misleading testimony at that hearing about the number and kind of emails sent by Clinton aide Huma Abedin to her husband Anthony Weiner.

Comey’s sudden dismissal comes as the FBI is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any possible ties to the Trump campaign.|||
