As a blogger, I have always wanted a tool to let users highlight text and leave comments. It is so easy to set up and I was surprised by the sheer amount of quality content generated by my readers.

I can easily moderate comments. The filter feature is so powerful that only "helpful" comments get displayed. Pre-moderation turns off all comments until they are approved by a moderator. I can also pin the best comments so everyone sees it. I don't lose any control over my blog.|||
