In the January 2017, ASUS has released a top competitor of Raspberry Pi in the form a single board computer named as Tinker Board. It was put in the direct competition to Raspberry Pi. Though the ASUS Tinker Board is costly than the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, it offers some extra features and performance which make it a worth purchase. Till the date, this amazing SBC was available only in the UK and neighbor regions, but now finally, it is also available in the US market.

In our previous post, we have provided the detailed review of ASUS Tinker Board and its specifications. Let us give you a quick view of it here also.

The ASUS Tinker Board has lot visual similarities with the Raspberry Pi Board. This 4K- capable SBC comes with a double RAM and faster chip than the Raspberry Pi 3 and is available to purchase on AMAZON.COM.

The CPU and GPU have the same specifications like the ASUS Chromebook Flip and other Chromebooks. It has some similar or greater specs to the Raspberry Pi 3 but does not have an inbuilt storage like the Pi has.

This board supports the TinkerOS which is a Debian Linux based Operating System. Other Operating Systems can also be used to it, but we recommend to use this official OS.

Aimed to the hobbyists and enthusiasts who are looking for the affordable options to build their own designs and circuits, this single board computer is sized to a pack of playing cards and can be fit easily into the surveillance systems, media players, and almost all the IoT products. Firstly, it was available for only some particular countries in and around the UK; the ASUS Tinker Board is available for the purchase in the US now.|||
