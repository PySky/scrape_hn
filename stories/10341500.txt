With fall launch season slowly drawing to a close, it does seem like the right time to see some new iMacs. According to 9to5Mac, Apple plans on unveiling a brand-new 21.5-inch iMac next week, complete with a 4K display.

The new iMac won't differ much aesthetically from the current-gen models — the overall iMac design language hasn't changed much since 2012 — so the late-2015 model's differentiating factors will most likely be its screen and faster graphics card. The new all-in-one will also almost certainly ship with El Capitan and be a little pricier than its non-4K brethren. Expect it to launch on the 13th.|||
