We will be just exploring the code generated by AWS CodeStar and making minor changes.

Let's Open the directory where we cloned this repository in a code editor. (please use the code editor of your choice)

First, you can see it already has a file with few dependencies listed, This means we can easily use any npm module we want.

Let's edit the package.json file and update the to

The directory also contains few other files, But we wont get into all these files in this tutorial.

If you open file you can see some code there, If you have used earlier then this will easily make sense to you.

There are two methods and and they respond accordingly when we make API Requests.

For example: When we open our application url https://jbn1gx1p26.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/ we see the message

Lets edit the file and let's change our code to

After saving the changes, Let's commit our code., This will trigger our deployment process and once the process is completed, We can open https://jbn1gx1p26.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/ and see the changes reflected there.

The deployment process is slow and takes some time (atleast for me it took some time), So please be patient.|||

In this tutorial we will be using AWS services and create a service that will allow us to send Email and SMS notifications wherever we want by calling an API endpoint. We will make use of AWS CodeStar, Lambda, Simple Email Service (SES), Simple Notification Service (SNS) and few other..., Let's get started.
