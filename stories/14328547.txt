At Build developers conference 2017, Microsoft officially released its Fluent Design System previously known as Project Neon. This is the new design language for Windows, and it will be making an appearance in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. These design guidelines are supposed to be an evolution of the windows 10 Metro/Modern UI look.

Microsoft is touting this as a design evolution, bold, scalable, universal design, A step into the future of sensory experiences. Microsoft says its goal is to help developers build more engaging apps and experiences that work across a variety of devices and inputs, especially as the company moves towards augmented and virtual reality.

Microsoft’s Fluent design can be described using 5 fundamental elements. They are:

Think about the frame that contains your information. Now break it apart, and reinvent how things relate to each other within a more layered, physical environment. Depth brings parallax effect and makes use of layering.

Think of motion design like a movie. Seamless transitions keep you focused on the story, and bring experiences to life. Motion can be used to show connection, relation, and context between elements and objects.

The things that surround us in the real world are sensory and invigorating. They bend, stretch, bounce, shatter, and glide. Material allows to control an element’s texture and change as one interacts with it.

Scaling our design system from 0D to 3D, inviting innovation across new forms. Scale lets elements and objects to go beyond two dimensions and adapt themselves according to the size of a screen.|||
