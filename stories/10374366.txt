Who are the most active technology investors in Europe today? Tech.eu has run the numbers based on the data we’ve been meticulously collecting over the past two years, and today we’re introducing a new report based on that research.

It’s no surprise that the biggest names in European venture capital are among the most active investors, but the top 25 list we’ve compiled over the past few weeks may still surprise you.

Aside from offering information on how active Europe’s tech investment firms have been in the first half of this year, the report also provides insight into the geographical spread of the region’s most active tech financiers, what vertical they tend to pump capital in to, the median round size of their most recent investments, what stage they typically invest in, how their age correlates to activity and more insightful analysis on top of the data.

The report can be purchased here (price: only €99).
