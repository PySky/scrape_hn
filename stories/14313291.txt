Let me shortly say that tattooing or tattoo is seen as a way of decorating the body by puncturing the skin and inserting colored substances under the surface.Are you planning on getting a new tattoo for your skin? It is with utmost importance that you become aware of the recent report on the adverse reactions of tattoo to the body. According to the reports received by the FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), there are adverse infections from contaminated tattoo inks and allergic reactions to the inks themselves.If you do get an infection from a tattoo, you might get a high fever and start feeling shaky and sweaty. A doctor would need to treat the infection with antibiotics, and in severe cases, you could be hospitalized and need surgery.If you're having an allergic reaction, you could develop a rash that doesn't go away. Other times, you can get scar tissue in the form of bumps around the tattoo.In reaction to the above received reports, a dermatologist, Sejal Shah stated that "With tattoos, customers should always understand that there is some uncertainty.  "Ask them where they purchase their ink, how it is diluted — is sterile water used? — and stored, as well as their personal adverse reaction rates. In other words, how many of their clients have had infections or other issues?"If you want to get a tattoo, the FDA recommends you look into the tattoo parlor and tattoo artist and make sure both the place and the technician follow state and local laws. And run far, far away from "do-it-yourself" tattoo kits.If you develop a bad reaction to a tattoo, call your doctor immediately, then tell the tattoo artist so he or she knows not to use the ink ever again and also get lots of information about the ink used.|||
