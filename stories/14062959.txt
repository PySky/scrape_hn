If you had read my first post on Medium, you should probably know I’ve started to dig again into web development (Front End) during the last year and I’m really happy about that. What makes me really excited this days is the new CSS Grid Layout which has been shipped into almost (ehm…) all the browsers. Apart from rewriting my personal website from scratch to use CSS Grid, I’ve started to compile a list of useful resources about the new layout. You can find my list on Github, plus I’ll keep this post updated in order to reach more audience.
