Many nonprofits across America are catching onto the coworking trend. Vilas Dhar, founder of Boston’s non-profit Next Mile Project, hopes to use the foundations of the coworking space to reach the local market and strengthen other non-profit organizations. His goal has been “to bring the same network, training, mentorship, and camaraderie available to tech startups to organizations working on issues like social justice and global development.” Chicago’s Literacenter is an organization with a very similar mission. The non-profit’s 38,000-square-feet of space provides “offices, meeting rooms, event spaces, back office services and educational programming for member organizations at a minimal cost,” putting its attention to the non-profit sector.
