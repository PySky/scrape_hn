Recently at Viget, we've been developing a number of highly interactive client-side applications. We've long been believers in continuous integration and continuous deployment, which typically involves the CI service (CircleCI, in our case) running a Capistrano deployment to push the latest updates to the integration environment after all the other checks pass.

And what's EXTRA cool is that this technique allows for continuous deployment for every branch you push up, without having to deal with database discrepencies, managing virtual hosts, etc. Interested? Good. Let's see how it's done.

First, let's create an AWS S3 bucket with the proper configuration for hosting our app:

Next, let's set up our application's scripts and configuration for deploying to our newly created S3 bucket. We'll want to keep our AWS credentials out of the repository. Create a file with the following:|||
