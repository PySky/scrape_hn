Gnosis is a very interesting cryptocurrency project, closely related to Ethereum; a “prediction market platform” according to its founders.

A week ago, less than 5% of the total Gnosis “currency” was sold in an auction that raised $12.5M (or 250,000 Ethereum at that time), bringing its total market value to about $300M. At the auction closing, a single GNO token was valued at approximately $29.8.

Today, its first day in the “cryptocurrency” market (mostly on Poloniex and Kraken), a single GNO is worth 0.070 BTC, or about $100. If you participated in the auction, and are now selling your GNO tokens, you made more than 3x your initial investment, in a week. However, in the meantime, the ETH you consumed to buy GNO jumped in value by more than 50%, which means the real gain is closer to a 2x. Pretty good anyway.

But today’s “performance” in the market doesn’t say much — I bet it’s mostly speculation that’s driving the price up (or down). What I’m really interested is to see whether Gnosis will manage to create one of the first interesting use case for cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. I’ll cross my fingers.|||
