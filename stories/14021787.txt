The cloud-computing industry is going through a gradual shift towards becoming an intelligent cloud. While compute, storage, and networking continue to be the revenue spinners for cloud vendors, it is machine learning that is becoming the focal point of the contemporary cloud.

Here are five cloud services that are highly influenced by machine learning.

Cognitive Computing aims to bring sensory capabilities to applications. It enables apps to see, listen, talk, and even make decisions. Based on natural language processing, visual recognition, face detection, emotion detection, video analytics, text to speech, speech to text, language translation, and sentiment analysis, Cognitive computing empowers developers with simple APIs. By consuming these services, applications become capable of delivering natural user experiences. Behind the scenes, it is machine learning that applies a variety of algorithms to provide these powerful cognitive capabilities. Though it looks deceptively simple, the cloud providers have invested a massive amount of resources to deliver cognitive APIs to developers. From insurance to finance, all the main industry verticals will start using Cognitive Computing platforms to provide a better experience to their customers.

Amazon AI, IBM Watson, Google Cloud and Microsoft Cognitive APIs are some of the commercial offerings available in the market.|||
