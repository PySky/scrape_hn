 There is a Crashed Porsche Cayenne in the back of a truck, but the truck driver is not aware of the situation, so he is just driving like nothing happened and dragging the Porsche like it is a trailer of the truck. There might be injured people who need urgent help, or even worse, but the truck driver is doing his job the best he can – he is driving. This is very unusual event, I’ve never seen something like this in my life! Watch the video below and draw your own conclusions.|||
