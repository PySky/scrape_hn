The cause of this has its roots in the chemical composition of coriander leaves, but there can also be other factors at play that determine whether or not you’re a fan of coriander.

The chemical composition of the essential oil of coriander leaves has shown it to be composed of around 40 different organic compounds, with 82 per cent of these being aldehydes, and 17 per cent alcohols. The aldehydes are mainly those with 9–10 carbon atoms, and it is these that are largely responsible for the aroma of coriander leaves – as well as its perceived soapy taste for some people.|||
