The motor industry is booming, with 2016 seeing 2.69 million cars registered in the UK covering 44 brands and almost 400 model types. Sure, you may drive a car made by a certain brand, but who owns that brand overall? And which brands are owned by the same company? The graphic below takes a look at the hierarchy within car brands, to see who owns who in the car industry. You may be surprised by some of the results.

With Peugeot’s owner PSA purchasing Vauxhall for £1.9 billion from General Motors, it becomes the second largest carmaker in Europe, behind Volkswagen.

Car sales in the UK have been on the rise, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that new car registrations rose by 1.8% to 257,679 in the year to February, continuing the record growth seen through 2016.
