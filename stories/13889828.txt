Spring Cloud Stream has added an additional module that enables the export of Spring Boot metrics on a dedicated channel. You can now collect metrics from your applications by simply adding the module on the classpath and providing a target destination as described in the reference documentation. By default, the module exports Spring Integration metrics (including bound channel metrics), but other metrics can be added as well. This enables first class support for traffic monitoring in Spring Cloud Stream applications.|||
