NIGERIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALWAYS BROKE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY

It is absolutely clear that Nigerians will continue to fall into the hand of a wrong democratic president, i always said it that government doesn't have plan for it citizens, rather they are fighting for their selfish interest. and the fight for selfish interest will continue not until we the citizen stand against it.why is it that when the Nigerian civil servant ask for their civil right the federal government will browbeat them by sayingÂ  they are broke(no money) during the past administration that is all what we have been hearing we are broke, so for god sake when will federal government have money.The 7 trillion generated through the TSA account is meant for what purpose, or is it meant for next generation looters. how long can civil servant leave in poverty, hardship and penury. they only concentrate on capital project can empty stomach walk on capital project.We need god to rule Nigerian from heaven above even the sai baba (buhari) has being compromised the powerful political juggernauts, even if his hale and hearty is not putting civil servant issue as a front runner, rather he prefer to say he his feeling our pains.|||
