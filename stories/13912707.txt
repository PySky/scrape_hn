 

 The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors:

 The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

 

 Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

 Note: Checking for the presence of the CMP subsystem is only required on devices running Cisco IOS XE Software, not Cisco IOS Software. Checking if the device is configured to accept Telnet connections is required for devices running either Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software.

 

 Cisco devices running a vulnerable Cisco IOS XE release are affected by this vulnerability when the following conditions are met: The CMP subsystem is present on the Cisco IOS XE software image running on the device, and The device is configured to accept incoming Telnet connections. In order to determine if the CMP subsystem is present on the running software image, execute the command show subsys class protocol | include ^cmp from a privileged CLI prompt on the device. 

 

 The following example shows the output of the command show subsys class protocol | include ^cmp when the CMP subsystem is present on the software image running on the device:

 

 

 The following example shows the output of the command show subsys class protocol | include ^cmp when the CMP subsystem is not present on the software image running on the device: 

 In order to determine if the device is configured to accept incoming Telnet connections, execute the command show running-config | include ^line vty|transport input from a privileged CLI prompt. The command output may indicate one of multiple possible configurations, such as the following: The absence of a transport input configuration line after the line vty configuration line indicates the device is using the default set of protocols for incoming connections through a virtual terminal (VTY). The default set of protocols includes the Telnet protocol; hence, this device will accept Telnet connections on all VTYs. This is a vulnerable configuration. The device has been explicitly configured to only accept the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol for incoming connections to a subset of the available VTYs, but VTYs numbered 6 to 15 are still using the default set of protocols. Hence, this device will accept Telnet connections to those VTYs. This is a vulnerable configuration. All available transport protocols have been enabled for incoming connections to all VTYs. Enabling all protocols also enables the Telnet protocol, and will allow Telnet connections to the device. This is a vulnerable configuration. The SSH protocol is the only protocol enabled for incoming connections on all VTYs. No Telnet connections are possible to any VTY on the device while using this configuration. This configuration is not vulnerable. Both the Telnet and the SSH protocols have been explicitly enabled as allowed protocols for incoming connections on all VTYs. Telnet connections to the device will be successful under this configuration. This is a vulnerable configuration.

The command output may indicate one of multiple possible configurations, such as the following: To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output. The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M: Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

 The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

 

 CMP-specific Telnet options are processed by default, even if no cluster configuration commands are present on the device configuration. 

 

 This vulnerability can be exploited during Telnet session negotiation over either IPv4 or IPv6. This vulnerability can only be exploited through a Telnet session established to the device—sending the malformed options on Telnet sessions through the device will not trigger the vulnerability.
