As he often does, Musk took to Twitter to make the announcement:

After releasing the first version of the beta in August, Tesla followed up with a second beta release in September. We had the chance to road test this version on a Model S equipped with the Autopilot features and I suggest you read our report to get all the details ahead of the wide release:

Yesterday Tesla released a third update to the beta software with only minor changes over the previous build, meaning our report should be a mostly accurate description of the functions.

Now the v7.0 software will also include some improvements for Model S not equipped with Autopilot hardware including: improved climate control, improved efficiency and performance for RWD Model S’s, new and improved “hill start assist” now on all surface and of course the new user interface.
