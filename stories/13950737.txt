// Helper function to create a new node with the given data and

// pushes it onto the front of the list

// Function to detect Cycle in a linked list using Hashing

// return false if we already have seen this node before

// move to the next node

// we reach here if list does not contain any cycle|||

Given a linked list, detect cycle in it. Simple solution would be to use hashing. The idea is to traverse the given list & insert each encountered node into
