Preamble: This is a post targeted more to package maintainers.

Although composer allows us to install a package as dist with --prefer-dist option, it doesn't make a big difference at this point in time, because you end up with all the files used for development (docs, tests, examples, etc) for each installed package.

If each package maintainer would include a .gitattributes file in which (s)he enumerates all the files and directories that can be excluded from dist, we could have a more clean vendor/

So when someone will install that package through with --prefer-dist option, all the files and directories listed in .gitattributes file will be excluded. This could have a big impact on big deployments and/or testing. This solution works right now. Just commit a ".gitattributes" file in your git root directory and you are ready to go.

Note: Composer is missing Gitlab support for "dist", so this would not work with Gitlab at this point in time. However, it works with Github and Bitbucket.

Later edit: It looks like when someone tries to push a good practice its a weirdo and (s)he gets advised to build is/her own build system. If the same post was made by @philsturgeon, @ircmaxell or any other known community member, this would get a total different feedback.

I don't know what is more weirdo: When a John Doe tries to come with a solution to a problem and he gets bashed, or when the community has ears only for the known community members.

Very mature people around here.|||
