At a recent All Hands, I shared some thoughts about platforms and notebooks. If you weren’t there, you didn’t miss much. The only takeaway — and takeaway is probably generous — was this Venn diagram:

Readers may notice that there’s an idea lurking in the footnote at the bottom of this diagram. The idea is that notebooks, considered by most to be the domain of the data scientist, have a real shot at helping teams of all types who are working on data problems.

I’m happy with the colors, but to bring this idea to life, we’ll need more than a Venn diagram, amirite?

PixieDust is a helper library for Python notebooks. It makes working with data simpler.

With PixieDust, I can do this in a notebook…

Instead of doing all this…

A scatterplot! No code! With options and controls I can use!

With PixieDust, data scientists and data engineers can

Now, people with varied skills and skill levels — even people like me — can use and share notebooks, and collaborate.

But don’t just take my word for it. Ben Hudson, an offering manager on the dashDB team, said this about PixieDust:

IBM Data Science Experience (DSX): Check out the PixieDust intro notebook on DSX to see PixieDust in action. To play with this notebook in DSX, follow these steps to bring the notebook into your account:

Jupyter Notebooks: If you’re comfortable on the command line, you can run PixieDust inside Jupyter Notebooks on your laptop, too. The PixieDust installation guide has you covered for an easy install, and takes care of configuration and all the dependencies at once (e.g., installs Spark, Scala, the Cloudant-Spark connector, and a few sample notebooks).
