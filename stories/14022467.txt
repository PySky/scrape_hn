Empowering the magical process of education, creation, and transformation. This month we merged Darwin, a minimal active learning tool, with Alcamy. A community of self-learners and experts who curate the resources of the web into free, structured units of education that can help you master topics of knowledge and keep your skills sharp. “Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.” — Jim Rohn Learn more about Alcamy at https://alcamy.org Want a personal website? Teach yourself HTML & CSS online. Does that job need you to understand databases? Learn it online, play around with a few examples. How about machine learning… you can take it from there. We believe in three things when it comes to self-education. Accessibility, up-to-date content and being able to apply your knowledge practically.

Experts and self-learners organize the resources of the web into cronological programs that you can learn from. Resources are individual articles, projects, videos or presentations that are the actual learning material being curated. Each resource is attached to a quiz. Actively test your understanding right then and there. Track your progress over time. Each topic has a community of self-learners and experts. Ask them for help, discuss material. The learning resources under each topic self-adjust and improve as more people take them.

Our goal is to curate and maintain open learning content, and make it available to the public free of charge. Go see for yourself at https://alcamy.org or see us featured on Product Hunt today!|||
