Our display recognizes who's in front of it and only displays information that they care about. So in the morning it can show you news and traffic updates and the kids can walk by to see their chores for the week.

With both native and IFTTT integrations, connect your smart devices and create routines that automatically control devices like your lights and thermostat depending on time of day and the weather outside.

With innovative gesture recognition alongside a voice interface, you're always in complete control. See what commands are available, swipe to interact, and enjoy an assistant that understands what you want.|||

Daptly is making gesture and voice controlled displays with Amazon Alexa that allow you to control your devices, play music, read and send emails, and more.
