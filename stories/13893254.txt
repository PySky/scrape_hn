Absolutely none! We don't handle your payments directly and only have access to the funds that you give us. This means we have to ask for everything up front and surprises can't happen.

The slot summary page contains two links: to upgrade / change the slot and to initiate and complete slot-to-slot data transfers. Finally you may optionally request a refund on your existing slot via a support ticket.

This can be done at any point during your month.

All slots can be cancelled in the first seven days for a full refund without fussâ€•just open a support ticket.

Although we'd love feedback if something has gone wrong. Oh, and expect an eager support person to try and right that wrong.

Want to test the water ahead of time? Not sure if a slot is right for you? Or perhaps you simply want to check things out without committing?

You are more than welcome to request a refund in the first seven days to trial our slots. (It'll be a full refund too!)

You can cancel by simply not renewing. We will then recycle your slot shortly after its month is up and you will be welcome to return whenever you wish.|||
