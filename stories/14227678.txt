Database design and decisions use to be fairly straightforward. Pick your relational database engine, map out the general entities, apply the third-normal-form (3NF) to them and you're basically done.With the Cambrian explosion of database options and variations created from 2009 to present, it gets much harder to even choose the database much less follow the well-worn path of 3NF.On this episode, you'll meet Rick Copeland, a fellow MongoDB Master and author of the book MongoDB Applied Design Patterns. We will discuss modeling data using documents in a document database such as MongoDB and some techniques that particular apply to MongoDB's implementation.Links from the show:|||
