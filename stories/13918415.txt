Ranvier is not a websocket MUD. It does not have a web client. It is a plain ol' fashioned telnet MUD. Any client you use to connect to the MUD you played 15 years ago will work with Ranvier.

Ranvier prides itself on having thorough documentation which is available on our website: ranviermud.com (You can also view them locally; see the Documentation section of our Contributing guide.)

We have a slack channel you can use to ask questions, suggest features, or just keep up to date with the project: https://ranviermud.slack.com

The default bundles come together to make a basic Diku style MUD with the following features:

You can build your MUD on top of these bundles or disable them and build yours completely fresh while still taking advantage of all of the core code.

To try out what Ranvier looks like out of the box as a player telnet or point your favorite client to mud.ranviermud.com on port 4000. The server is updated from the github branch, reset, and restarted every hour.|||

Ranvier is a Node.js-based MUD codebase built for modularity, extensibility and getting up-and-running in the least amount of time possible.
