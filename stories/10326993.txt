We from childhood have the interest in someone’s theory, we never been practical in our life for a second but we all know the importance of being practical in life but still we always fear to think, take risk and feel alive.

“Theory Only makes us Understand of Something That has been Already Discovered and Nothing More.”

After having the understanding of something now the hard part is to imagine and discover it in your own way, which gives the desired results you seek in your life for being happy and for being successful. But history gives the examples of people, who have never ever done anything in their life and used someone’s theory and knowledge to build their reputation in the life because of the fear they faced to understand the new technology or theory, which is yet not discovered. But many people have shown the technique to the world to overcome the fear and use this fear to build something or to understand anything new.

Have you ever invented something new in your life? If not what are you waiting for and if yes what is that, how you felt while discovering it, did you face fear which was stopping you? Share here with me.|||
