In this talk we’ll explore how we replaced a buggy iOS app and an outsourced and abandoned Android app with a single React Native and ClojureScript app.



React Native allowed us to write a single codebase; GraphQL allowed us to eliminate the data-syncing issues that plagued the iOS app; ClojureScript let us move fast and recreate, in a matter of months, what took almost two years to build in Swift and Java.



We’ll discuss the obstacles that we encountered, how we circumvented them, and where we think the mobile industry will move. This is an exciting time to be (or become!) a mobile app developer.
