I got the new MacBook Pro (13″, fully maxed-out version) several months ago. My older MacBook Pro was (and is!) in good working order, but when I hired my brother last year he ended up using my ancient MacBook Air. Every time he’d do basic work the computer sounded like it was gearing up to blast off to the moon.

So we continued our life-long tradition of Ian getting my hand-me-downs. I upgraded to the new MacBook Pro and he got my old MacBook Pro.

Here’s my thoughts on the new MacBook Pro after using it for a few months:

I honestly don’t know. I’ve watched friends like Dave Rupert and Scott Jenson document their Windows journeys, and while they seem to be mostly happy, it’s not without significant time and effort. Other friends who have dipped their toes into the Windows waters came away less impressed. I like to think that I could give it a shot, but in reality I have far too little time and bandwidth to mess around with all that.

I  just want a computer that boots up reliably, plays audio and video, allows me to work for more than a couple hours before dying, and has a keyboard that doesn’t freak out on me.|||
