I created study notes for my recent interviews. I am sharing them here so that others can benefit from it. The notes are specifically for theory based Java interviews, typically done in service based companies (as opposed to coding based interviews done in product companies).

These are study notes, mostly for revision couple of days before the interview. Check resources on each topic for more in-depth preparation.

Answers to such questions vary based on multiple factors (interviewer and interviewee's experience with Java, exposure to other languages, personal taste, etc). Thus, take the answers with pinch of salt, and make them your own before using them.|||
