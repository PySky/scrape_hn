Roughly, ten years ago I did a tour in Iraq with the Marine Corpsa in Camp Fallujah (05-06), I ran across some google water. I think it was a third country national that brought to me. It’s actually water from Syria as labelled on the bottle. You might consider this a “legal” war trophy. This of course was before the Syrian civilian war kicked off.

When I was Iraq I auctioned off bottle and the money went to the Fisher house. (One of my favorite charities.) But Ebay shut down the auction because it violated the copyright laws.  If my memory serves me right, I think someone emailed me and we set up a fake ebay listing and then they bought that fake listing for $500 of which the $500 which to the Ebay / Fisher Charity.

Recently, I dug out 5 bottles that I had brought back from Iraq. They had been packed away in  the garage for like the last 10 years. Regardless, they are in good shape and I don’t want them any more. I will happily sell them in exchange for a donation to the the Fisher house. Please email and we can set up arrangements to transfer the money to charity and exchange the bottles or if someone knows a better way to transfer the bottles via charity, please let me know.

Here is a little history as preserved by the internets…

But it’s important to note, this water is will not bring you magically powers, at least none that I’m aware of.|||

Found in Iraq/Syria, there is such thing as Google water.
