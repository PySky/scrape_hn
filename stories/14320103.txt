FCIS is a fully convolutional end-to-end solution for instance segmentation, which won the first place in COCO segmentation challenge 2016.

FCIS is initially described in a CVPR 2017 spotlight paper. It is worth noticing that:

This is an official implementation for Fully Convolutional Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation (FCIS) based on MXNet. It is worth noticing that:

If you find FCIS useful in your research, please consider citing:

Running time is counted on a single Maxwell Titan X GPU (mini-batch size is 1 in inference).

MXNet from the offical repository. We tested our code on MXNet@(commit 62ecb60). Due to the rapid development of MXNet, it is recommended to checkout this version if you encounter any issues. We may maintain this repository periodically if MXNet adds important feature in future release. Python packages might missing: cython, opencv-python >= 3.2.0, easydict. If is set up on your system, those packages should be able to be fetched and installed by running For Windows users, Visual Studio 2015 is needed to compile cython module.

Any NVIDIA GPUs with at least 5GB memory should be OK

Please download VOC 2012 dataset with additional annotations from SBD. Move folders to VOCdevit and make sure it looks like this: Please use the train&val split in this repo, which follows the protocal of SDS. Please download COCO dataset and annotations for the 5k image minival subset and val2014 minus minival (val35k). Make sure it looks like this: Please download ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-v1-101 model manually from OneDrive, and put it under folder . Make sure it looks like this:
