In a pinch, I needed to randomize the order of a few thousand lines of plain text. In Linux you can just pipe the file through , even right inside Vim:

But I was stuck on Windows. And I don't know how to randomize a file in native Vim script. But doing it in Ruby is pretty easy, and luckily, Vim has awesome Ruby support. Tne minutes' work and a few peeks at and we have a successful, working kludge:|||
