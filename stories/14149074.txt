Today’s 2.0 release includes free use of many requested power features such as thread snoozing, send later (aka scheduled send), and reminders. They join existing features like unlimited open/link tracking, enriched contacts, and unified inbox to make Nylas Mail the most powerful cross-platform mail app.

Our 2.0 release also includes full support for Windows and Linux users. Thanks for your patience — we expected to get this done sooner, but it was harder than we initially thought. (Shipping a great cross-platform app still requires lots of care, even with ElectronJS.)

In the three months since our 1.0 release in January, we’ve also made hundreds of changes under the hood to Nylas Mail, resulting in huge gains for performance, security, and stability. As we previously wrote, Nylas Mail syncs your data locally, bypassing the Nylas Cloud sync engine. And of course, Nylas Mail is open source on GitHub.

For the email power users, we have migrated Nylas Pro features to Nylas Mail. All Nylas N1 users will be converted to Pro users on Nylas Mail, including those who were grandfathered with a free year in 2016. If you are a Nylas N1 subscriber and you have other questions about Nylas Mail, please check out the FAQ. To check the status of your Nylas Mail account, sign in to the billing portal.

Thanks again for supporting Nylas and open source software. Building the future of email isn’t an easy task, and we couldn’t have gotten this far without you, our community.

If you have comments or questions, we’d love to hear on Twitter.|||
