Snapchat has denied reports that claims, CEO Evan Spiegel labelled India as ‘poor’ and the app is meant “only for rich people”.

The Chief Executive Officer, Evan Spiegel said that Snapchat is for everyone and the company is “grateful” to its Indian users.

The alleged claim emerged last week by a former employee Mr. Pompliano against Snapchat’s parent company, Snap. Snapchat has completely denied the remark made by the employee that Mr. Spiegel has suggested to follow growth only in particular international markets.

The ‘comment’ has not gone that well with social media users, urging people to uninstall the app as a mark of protest. In the case of incorrect identity, many users have uninstalled the e-commerce app, Snapdeal instead of Snapchat app.|||
