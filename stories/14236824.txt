Nasi isandla, ndicel’ undiphe

Nantsi intloko, ingqondo ifile

Mongameli, ndijonge emehlweni

Ndingumuntu nam

Nqanda mama! Isikolo sitshile!

Phel’ imfundo! Icawa iphumile

Onamandla ndibaptize ngomlilo; ndibe ngcwele nam



(Here is a hand, share with me please

Here is a head, the mind is dead

Governor, look me in the eye

See I am a human too

Beware mama! The school is burnt to the ground!

End of knowledge! Church is out

Oh most Powerful baptise me with fire; make me holy too)



I have fallen, will I awaken?

I’m a mess and you tell me I’m faking

God alone She knows I have tried very hard

Burn it all to the ground

Leave it bleeding

Poisoning all the people you’re leading

God alone She knows I have tried very hard



Emergency

Insecurity

No Opportunity



It’s just another day in the Banana Republic



All your people dying in freedom

Suffering a profound lack of leading

Are you even there when we call? Are you a human, man?

Full of lies! Can’t believe what I’m hearing

From your lips a river of scheming

Poisoning all the water we’re drinking

Are we good to go?



Emergency

Discovery

No opportunity



It’s just another day in the Banana Republic



State of emergency!!!!



Banana Republic
