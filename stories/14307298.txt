Apple Inc. already tracks your steps and fitness levels, and now it wants to analyze your sleep.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant has acquired Beddit, a maker of sleep-tracking hardware and software, according to a message on the closely held Finland-based company's website. A purchase price wasn't disclosed and an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Beddit sells a $150 sensor strip that can be placed under bed sheets and transfers slumber-related information to an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch for analysis. The accompanying Beddit app can tell users how long they slept and breaks down your night into categories such as "restless sleep," "snoring" and "awake." Like the Apple Watch, it also provides heart rate data to an iPhone.

The deal gets Apple further into the business of health tracking. The company has been working on sleep tracking functionality for the Apple Watch for a number of years, Bloomberg News has reported. Beddit's technology could help with that. Fitbit Inc., an Apple competitor in the fitness device space, recently rolled out more sleep-tracking features for its line of wearables.

Even more activity tracking may be coming from Apple, which has broader ambitions to turn its HealthKit software into a diagnosis tool. Apple is testing skiing and snowboarding activity tracking, according to a document reported by Gizmodo.

Beddit customers can use HealthKit to connect its app to Apple's Health app, according to Beddit's website. The buy button on the Finnish company's site now sends shoppers to Apple's online store, and the device is no longer listed on Amazon.com. Beddit was working on an Android app, but that detail is no longer on its site.

The Beddit deal was reported earlier by 9to5Mac.|||
