The other day I saw a Reddit post on issues a writer was facing when starting to write a story.

This got me thinking about how I write stories. And made me realize that it might be something that’s helpful to other people.

So here you are, the three-step framework I follow every time I’m starting to write a story.

1) Define an overarching concept, or “What the Book is About”. This is usually a description of some aspect of the world, or of a particular character

2) Define a character who lives in this world, and what the want out of the world. If the “What the Book is About” describes a character trait, then this will usually expand on that, but it doesn’t have to.

For example, I once had an idea about a character who always makes the correct Game Theory decision to every choice. Despite knowing no Game Theory or Economic Theory. In fact, in the first several stories, he’s just a child.

However, when I started writing those stories – the “What the Book is About Character” wasn’t a protagonist, in fact, he wasn’t even a speaking character. I just wrote a series of stories about people in a world where people like this type of character exists.

3) Once you’ve defined your character and what they want. Figure out how they get it, and write that down, along with the challenges they face and the allies and enemies they encounter along the way.

A sub-framework I use for this is answering these three questions

But it’s designed to give you just enough guidance to get myself started. While still giving me plenty of wiggle room to create a new story in a new world.|||
