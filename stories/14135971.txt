- [Instructor] Welcome! In this course, you're going to learn the most important set of skills that you need to be ready for coding interviews with technology companies, large and small. My name is YK, and in the past, I've worked as a software developer and a data scientist at various software companies, including Google and Microsoft. So, why should you care about coding interviews in the first place? First of all, coding interviews are becoming more and more common for software development jobs, and even if you're not looking for a job right now, practicing for coding interviews is also a great way to become a better programmer in general.

In this course, I'm going to give you a quick introduction to coding interviews. What they're like, and how to start preparing for them. After that, the structure of this course is going to be a review of a concept, followed by some practice problems. The concepts I'm going to cover in this course include, strings, two dimensional arrays, hash tables, time complexity, and Big O notation. I chose these topics because they are the most useful concepts to master for coding interviews.

And, at the end, I'm going to give you a few tips for acing your interviews. This course is good for beginners and intermediate programmers as an introduction. But it's also designed for experienced programmers and advanced computer science students as a refresher, and a good way to practice coding interview problems. So, let's get started.|||
