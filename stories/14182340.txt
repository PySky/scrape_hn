I love coffee!

 And drink it right now. ðŸ™‚

 I usually drink coffee with regular milk and I was ready to try something new â€“ coffee with coconut oil.

 What?

 Yes! And it is delicious!!

 This is great morning drink that will definitely wake you up and prepare you for a great day!

What you need is:

 cup of coffee

 1 tsp spoon of coconut oil

 1 tsp spoon of honey (if you like sweeter coffee)

Direction:

 1. Make a really good coffee. I use Deâ€™Longhi coffee machine. ðŸ™‚ And love it!

 2. In the blender put coconut oil and coffee. Blend, blend, until lighter color.

 3. Enjoy your coffee.

If you donâ€™t already use coconut oil and will buy only to try it with coffee. Buy the best quality and then you can also use it in different ways! Those are my favorites:

How do you use Coconut Oil? Do you like it in coffee?|||
