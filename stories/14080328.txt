The Trump administration is reviewing design bids for its proposed wall along the US-Mexico border. But not all plans are interpreting the word "wall" literally.

A group of Mexican and American engineers and urban planners called MADE Collective want to build a $1 trillion hyperloop transportation network instead. The plan would turn the border into a shared nation, called Otra Nation, with an independent local government and nonvoting representatives in the US and Mexican legislatures.

The group submitted its design to the US Customs and Border Protection's official call for proposals in March.

It also launched a petition to replace the current border fencing with its hyperloop design.
