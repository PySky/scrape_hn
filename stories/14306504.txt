I’ve never been good enough to make complex manipulations on data but to writing algorithms and build web applications a big Yes.

→ This is not a guide to be a full Data Science Engineer, I’m just sharing what I started with in this field.

→ This is not the unique path too.

Instead, you can consider it as one start study plan for those coming from Software Development and want to be Junior Data Science engineer.

Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems.

For me, it is all things we are doing with data that can solve some problems and come out with business value or growth.

As we said up there it is about manipulating data the whole time, but what kind of data can we manipulate?

On the internet or large enterprise applications there are a lot of data coming from different sources as social media, call to actions, simple forms, log data, transactions, emails …

All things we are doing online or others place required the most times that we input data, these data can be in different types:

Also in different formats:

There are a lot of languages to Data Sciencing(hahaha), some of them are very popular and more used than others.

There are a few: R, Python, Java …|||

A good place to start Data Science as a beginner, learn a lot of interesting things easily and get a certificate.
