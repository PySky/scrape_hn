As you probably know I am developing a series posts called- Pragmatic Automation with WebDriver. They consist of tons of practical information how to start writing automation tests with WebDriver. Also, contain a lot of more advanced topics such as automation strategies, benchmarks and . In the next couple of publications, I am going to share with you some Advanced WebDriver usages in tests. Without further ado, here are the today's advanced WebDriver Automation tips and trips.

You can use the special Actions WebDriver's class to perform complex UI interactions. Through its method  you can drag and drop. You only need to set the desired X and Y offsets.

It is a straightforward task to upload a file using WebDriver. You need to locate the file element and use the IWebElement's SendKeys method to set the path to your file.

Through the ITargetLocator interface of the IWebDriver, you can locate the JavaScript alert. Then you can use the Accept and Dismiss methods of the IAlert interface.

WebDriver drives the browser within a scope of one browser window. However, we can use its SwitchTo method to change the target window or tab.

The WindowHandles property returns all open browser windows. You can pass the name of the desired tab/window to the Window method of the ITargetLocator interface (returned by the SwitchTo method) to change the current target.

WebDriver's INavigation interface contains handy methods for going forward and backward. Also, you can refresh the current page.

In my previous post from the series, I showed you how to create a new custom Firefox profile. You can set its argument 'general.useragent.override' to the desired user agent string.

Similar to the user agent configuration, to set a proxy for Firefox, you only need to set a few arguments of the Firefox' profile.

There isn't a built-in mechanism in WebDriver to scroll focus to a control. However, you can use the JavaScript's method window.scroll. You only need to pass the Y location of the desired element.

There are two ways to do the job. The first one is to use the IWebElement's SendKeys method with empty string.  The second is to use a little bit of JavaScript code.|||
