Environment variables are strings by default. This can be rather inconvenient if you're dealing with a number of them, and in a variety of desired types. Parsenvy aims to provide an intuitive, explicit interface for retrieving these values in appropriate types with human-friendly syntax.

Contributions of all sorts are welcome, be they bug reports, patches, or even just feedback. Creating a new issue or pull request is probably the best way to get started.|||
