As part of the Wireless Field Day 8 delegation, I had the pleasure of taking a briefing with Aruba Networks in a meeting room at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara. This magnificent facility is where the San Francisco 49ers play, and will be the site of Super Bowl 50 in February of 2016. Aruba (now an HP company) is behind the wireless network at the stadium, and our briefing featured Chuck Lukaszewski, who is Aruba’s Wi-Fi architect behind the stadium’s network. If you do Wi-Fi for a living, you can imagine the excitement in the room.

Chuck’s briefing focused on the principles of Very High Density wireless, and his methodology behind the design of the stadium’s Wi-FI network. Given that there are 1,000 access points in the facility, and that the network tends to get rave reviews, it’s a safe bet that he got it right.

Following Chuck’s discussion, my fellow delegates and I were treated to a tour of the stadium’s network infrastructure, starting with how some 600 access points were deployed in the bowl seating area (generally one for every 100 seats), and working our way into the stadium’s impressive data center.

I have followed the developments of stadium Wi-Fi over the last couple of years (like with this piece), so getting to spend a couple of hours in the 49er’s new home talking wireless was incredible.
