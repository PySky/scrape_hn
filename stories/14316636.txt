Today, DevOps is what drives innovation, efficiency and, ultimately, ROI. Traditional IT is no longer fit for purpose and is dying out, along with the companies that practice it.

If you work in IT, you know that. But does your boss? If not, it’s in your interest—and his interest and your entire business’s interest—to teach him.

Keep reading for a guide to building a business case for DevOps (by which I mean helping others see the business value of adopting DevOps tools and processes), as well as a way to map DevOps’s value.

Let’s start by explaining why articulating a business case for DevOps is important in the first place.

To date, the DevOps conversation has been a technical conversation, carried about only among technical people. The DevOps concept has been around since the late 2000s, but it has remained limited mostly to technical circles of IT practitioners since that time.

That makes DevOps different than, say, cloud computing or open source. You don’t have to be a developer or admin to know what these things are, or how they can help bring value to your business. They’re widely known, and their value is widely recognised.

The same cannot be said of DevOps--at least not yet.

To help change that, you need to help business decision-makers (who don’t necessarily have strong technical backgrounds) to grasp the value of DevOps for the entire organization. Key talking points in this regard include:

The talking points outlined above are good for helping to convince decision makers to give DevOps a try. But in order to make sure they really understand how much value DevOps brings to the organization, you should be able to quantify DevOps’s benefits by establishing and tracking metrics that allow you to measure how much more agile and cost-efficient DevOps makes the business.

Metrics like these allow you to construct a value stream map that will confirm the business value of your investment in DevOps.

In conclusion, if you think the DevOps conversation ends with the technical crowd, think again. By making a business case for DevOps, and helping to track the business value of DevOps practices, you can make your organization more agile, save money, and tremendously improve the efficiency and productivity of your IT staff.|||

Crucial to introducing DevOps is taking the conversation beyond the technical crowd and building a business case based on solid metrics.
