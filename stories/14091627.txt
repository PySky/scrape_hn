Few statistics rival the simplicity and explanatory power of those which are the most basic: the percentage, sum and average, among others. As a result they crop up everywhere, from exploratory data analysis to data dashboards and management reports.

But one of these, the arithmetic mean, is unusually problematic: while it is conventionally taught with one-dimensional data in mind, calculating it for multidimensional data requires a fundamentally different process. In fact, calculating the arithmetic mean as if your data is one-dimensional will produce grossly incorrect figures, sometimes orders of magnitude off from what was intended. For me, this was a humbling experience: even the arithmetic mean is no less deserving of double- and triple-checking than any other calculation.

The arithmetic mean is defined as:

We can see this through a simple example:|||
