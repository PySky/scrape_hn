Here is a non-exaustive, work in progress repository of resources for data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, internet of things (IoT), and more.

I've developed this set of resources for my InnoArchiTech blog writing, and for my personal learning, development, and use.

Resources include all files and links in this repository. A hyperlinked table of contents is provided below for your convenience, and note that links are listed in no particular order of preference or relevance. Well... except for my blog maybe :)

If you find this repository useful, please share it with others! Here are some ready-to-go sharing links:

You can follow @innoarchitech on Twitter and sign up for our newsletter for the latest InnoArchiTech content updates.

Cheers, and best of luck with your technical endeavors!|||
