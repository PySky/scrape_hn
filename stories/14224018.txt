Hey! Latif here from Roadmunk—we’re a product roadmapping software that helps PMs (including tons of agile PMs) visualize their strategy.

This is one of the most interesting questions PMs wrestle with—and we actually just wrote a blog post about it:

The short answer: no, they’re not. But it depends HOW you structure your roadmap. Because roadmaps should be flexible, we like to think of them as a statement of intent—not a literal roadmap. This framework actually fits very nicely into the flexiblity of the agile methodology.

Agile PMs usually bake flexibility straight into their roadmap. I’ll show you a few examples (these were all built by pivoting the same data from a Roadmunk template.) Purely agile PMs might structure their roadmap by theme, so there are NO DATES on the roadmap at all.

Another option would be to structure your roadmap by sprint—this one also has NO DATES. It helps chart what will happen in each sprint.

However, we’ve found that a lot of product managers can’t avoid the reality of time. Often, to align with the org, they find they have to build time into their roadmap in some way. You could do this by using “fuzzy time” buckets—saying when something will happen but not attaching it to any specific dates.

For agile folks who find they can’t avoid dates, we recommend using time buckets. We’ve found one of the most popular way to structure an agile roadmap (with dates) is to be a little more granular up front (bucketing features/tasks in months or quarters) and then get a lot “fuzzier” the farter out you get.

Hope this helps! If you’re curious about Roadmunk, we offer a free 14-day trial, which includes full access to all of our features. We also have a bunch of free product roadmap templates to get you started.|||
