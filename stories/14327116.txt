The 3DO was one of the most hyped consoles of the 90s. It received a large amount of attention from the mainstream media, financial investors, and gamers alike. When released, it was considered an incredibly powerful and impressive system. So why did it have such a short run and why did the 3DO Company fail. In this video we're going to look at how the founder EA teamed with the co creators of the original Amiga computer and Atari lynx to create one of the most anticipated pieces of gaming hardware from the 90s… only to see it fail to capture the market that seemed to covet it. This is the story of the 3DO. Partial list of sources at the end of description.
