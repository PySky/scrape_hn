Named Cittadella Cielo (Citadel of Heaven), the new facility expands the Nuovi Orizzonti mission to ‘bring joy to those who have lost hope’. Its recent gala opening saw performances by Italian stars including Andrea Bocelli, Nek, Raf and Cristina Scuccia (aka Sister Cristina, or ‘The Singing Nun’, winner of the second series of The Voice of Italy).

The Yamaha CIS system is installed in Cittadella Cielo’s 600-capacity main hall and features eight VXS5W and eight VXS8W loudspeakers, powered by XMV8280 and XMV4280 amplifiers. An MTX3 matrix mixer manages the system, with straightforward control via wall-mounted DCP4V4S and DCP1V4S panels, plus remote Wireless DCP. Input sources include two Line 6 XD-V75 wireless microphones and three Shure MX418C goosenecks.|||
