From a $560 purchase on Go Daddy to a $3,500 sale on NameJet in less than three months

It’s always interesting to see domain names move from one marketplace to another at a huge ROI, and even more interesting when it happens in a matter of months. This is exactly what happened with 000100.com which sold for $560 on Go Daddy on January 25th and then less than three months later sold on NameJet for $3,500 (source – NameBio Blog).

Just to be clear, I didn’t make this sale or have anything to do with it, I just read about it on NameBio’s blog and am writing about it now. For those keeping score that’s a 525% ROI in less than three months. Of course if this was repeatable every time then we’d all own an island or two and take private jets everywhere we go.

While things like this do happen in the domain name world, finding a way to do this repeatedly is incredibly hard. It’s seeing things like this that cause people to get inspired to become domain investors, but I think too often we only focus on the big wins like this that really represent a small percent of the actual transactions that take place. Take SustainableBusinesses.com which was purchased for $3,288 back in 2013 on Afternic and sold for $260 this week on Go Daddy – ouch.

So here’s the question. What can we learn from sales like 000100.com? Is this a complete outlier, a one-off that we shouldn’t read into, or is there something we can glean from this to produce similar results. As always, I’d love to hear from you – comment and let your voice be heard!|||
