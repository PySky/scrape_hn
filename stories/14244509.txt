The usual workflow is that you use it to manage a single main BiBTeX file, which is configured in your . As mentioned above, I prefer using small document-specific BiBTeX files.

This is what the first three lines sets up using an Emacs file variable. Note that the local bib file is specified without quotes of any kind. Also, because thereâ€™s no path specified, it lives together with the orgmode document itself, which I prefer.

After this, I have two LaTeX-specific lines ensuring that the output PDF looks prettier than default. You can thank me later.

The third line imports the package, which means I have extra cite commands to differentiate between for example textual citing (the first example) and parenthetical citing (the second example).

This is that really difficult intro spection, as was also demonstrated by . This is the even more difficult final section. We will now use a parenthetical citation .

Finally, very importantly, I have the orgmode orgmode markup to select a suitable bibliography style, and again to specify the bib file. This will get automatically translated to the suitable LaTeX or even HTML versions.|||
