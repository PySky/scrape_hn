Liane Katz created mama.codes alongside two fellow London mums, Luci Hindmarsh & Alice Thompson, to ensure their kids would have the skills they’d need to succeed.

With digital backgrounds across software engineering, digital journalism & marketing and product development, they were only too aware how vital a skill coding is today.

“They were aged 4 and 6 then, and we really struggled to find accessible, engaging coding apps and languages that also offered sustained learning,” Katz told The Memo. So they built their own tools based on child-friendly themes – jokes, nursery rhymes, pirates, dinosaurs, witches and more.

“We suddenly had our living rooms full of neighbours and school gate pals, keen to learn more about the hot topic of kids’ coding in a relaxed and sociable format,” recalls Katz.

“There was always cake, and often some booze to take the edge off the tech speak for beginners!”|||
