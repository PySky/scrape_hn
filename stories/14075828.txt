If our seemingly endless thirst for new technology is any indication, it's a good time to be a tech employee. Of course, potential growth in any job sector isn't just anecdotal. We can't predict the future of jobs in the tech industry by doing a headcount of people engaged with their phones on the train each day, but it can give us an idea of the continued interest in -- some would say addiction to -- technology. But are tech companies actually hiring? And are they hiring in the United States? The answer to both questions is yes. And that's where the hard numbers come in. Each year, The Computing Technology Industry Association, or CompTIA, releases Cyberstates, a thorough report on the state of the tech industry, breaking down national and state statistics on employment trends, salary information and more.

Some of the key findings of Cyberstates 2017 include:

-- There are 6.9 million workers employed in the U.S. tech industry

-- In 2016, there were 182,220 new jobs added, driven largely by gains in IT services and custom software services

-- There are 492,550 tech business establishments in the United States

-- There were 626,560 posted tech job openings during the final three months of 2016

-- The average annual salary of U.S. tech industry workers is $108,900

-- The estimated direct contribution of the tech industry to the U.S. economy is $1.3 trillion, or 7.5 percent

Although the industry is strong on the national level, some states do better than others. New York, California and North Carolina are seeing more tech growth than other states while Iowa, Kansas and Delaware are seeing the least.

If you live in a state on the lower end of tech-hiring trends, it may seem like a good idea to relocate where there are more opportunities, but any decision to move for a job should be weighed carefully. "You have to consider your situation," says Thomas Monaghan, a career consultant based in Dallas, Texas. "If there's one person moving, it may be a hassle but it doesn't take much to correct things if the new situation doesn't work out. But moving a family across the country or even to a nearby state is a different story. It can be disruptive for the children and the parents."

Still, even those states at the low end of the tech employment scale may offer more than enough opportunities. "The jobs are certainly fewer in number but some individuals may prefer the quality of life offered in a rural or less populated setting," says Steven Ostrowski, director of corporate communications of CompTIA, which is based in Downers Grove, Ill.

If relocation is an option, Ostrowski says several cities are emerging as tech centers that offer lower cost-of-living expenses than traditional hubs like Silicon Valley or Seattle. These up-and-coming cities include Nashville, New Orleans, Cleveland, Denver, Charleston, South Carolina, and Provo, Utah.

Even if you can't relocate, you still may be able to find employment with an out-of-state company.

"It's possible to find a tech employer who may allow you to work from home if the employee has a high-speed, secure Internet connection and basic collaboration tools," says Ostrowski. "More companies find this to be a realistic option when they're trying to meet their hiring needs."

Ostrowski says a career in IT is viable for employees on all ends of the experience spectrum. The key, he says, is to brush up on your skills, even those that aren't related to technology. "Employers find that it's often more efficient and effective to hire someone with strong soft skills and to supplement their technical skills with training than it is to hire someone who's strong in the technical specs of the job but less proficient in soft skills," says Ostrowski. "You can also kick-start a career in tech by supplementing academic credentials, degrees and work experience with a professional certification from a reputable organization. Employers are looking for some sort of validation that a candidate understands the technologies they'll be using in the workplace."

Anyone who's interested in working in technology should realize that the demand for strong workers is likely to remain strong for years. "Technology is deeply embedded in virtually every business and industry," says Ostrowski. "Healthcare, education, government, finance, entertainment, sports and dozens of other industries are hungry for workers who think strategically, communicate effectively, have strong business fundamentals and are creative in identifying how to use technology to make a business operate more efficiently and profitably."

-- With an estimated 245,674 workers, Illinois ranks seventh among the 50 states for tech industry employment.

-- Illinois is home to an estimated 24,353 tech business establishments. About 14,000 are located in the Chicago metropolitan area.

-- The tech industry employs an estimated 4.2 percent of the overall state workforce.

-- The annualized average wage for an Illinois tech industry worker was an estimated $99,500 in 2016, 77 percent higher than the average state wage of $56,200.

-- Employers posted more than 29,000 job openings for tech occupations in the final three months of 2016. An estimated 25,595 of those postings were in the Chicago market.|||
