Complaint #0: ôDö is horrible to search for. ôC++ö is a distinct string. I ended up having to use ôD Programming languageö or ôDigital Mars Dö every time I wanted results. Searching from within DigitalMars.com and then forcing Google to use the within domain and the ô-archiveö flag helped when I wanted language specific answers.

Request #1: The D Programming Language Documentation needs to be comprehensively indexed û both by subject and by concordance keyword.

Request #2: The documentation needs to be doubled: preferably by explaining more things, but perhaps by merely storing related topics on separate pages with footer linking.

Complaint #3: The D compile errors are obscure, occasionally incorrect, and happen in a multi-pass manner.|||

A detailed look at getting set up and started with D, as well as various highlights and pitfalls of the language
