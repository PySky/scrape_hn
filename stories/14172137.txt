The document says “For Internal Use and Distribution Only”, which allows DXC that’s CSC partner to capitalize on wining customers through social media. This will give competitors access to see how they win customers to help its employees and contractors engage in social media in a responsible, productive, and positive way, DXC has developed these Social Media Standard. The files are hosted on CSC internal network however because of this issue, which is outrageous we saw the article involving 13 root zone named servers that replicated incorrect permissions that spilled out over 100 Terabytes of data (13 DNS root zone named servers expose terabytes of corporate sensitive files)(2017). The documents claim that DXC Technology is committed to Confidentiality, Privacy, and Security — as the leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, an that DXC maintains websites and online communities that use applications and technology meeting rigorous internal testing Standard and security approvals, but these internal sensitive information is exposed due to the massive 13 DNS root zone named servers that spreaded the replicated permissions causing major meltdown. DXC follows all applicable privacy policies and laws if and when collecting, storing, using, or sharing any Personal Data on DXC-owned sites or online communities. We also abide by the appropriate confidentiality obligations relating to information from our clients, partners, vendors, or employees/contractors. The documents gives information that the employees/contractors should present themselves for the benefit of DXC and to do so during work hours, which These policies are available internally from DXC (EXPOSED DXC Document for competitors to access)(2017). The document states that the employees/Contractors are the greatest asset for protecting and promoting our brand. If we find your behavior is inconsistent with our brand, core values, or policies, we reserve the right to take appropriate action, but DXC Technology employs System Administrators who has these privileges, which we located a Twitter stating System Admins are at default for exposing this data however the problem is much more devastating discovering the 13 DNS root zone named servers causing a worldwide crisis dumping all corporation files on every network (TWITTER EXPOSING SYSTEM ADMINS FAILING TO SECURE FILES)(2017). The other DXC Technology document display’s “Confidential, for Use of the Commission Only as permitted by Rule”, which is a Securities Exchange Commission financial document that gives competitors access to Download from the link provided to know about their internal financial structure (EXPOSED DXC, CSC, HEWLETT PACKARD FINANCIALS)(2017). Due to the exposed Loan Agreement would cause refunds, cancellations, and asset seizures also property liquidation because the companies CSC, HPE and DXC Technology would be at a disadvantage in the market, which others will know how HPE, CSC, and DXC are going to bring in cash and spend it also raise the question on why are they getting a loan? I mean go to Cash Check Advance store if you don’t want to secure your own information and let others see your sensitive information, also other Loan term agreement sensitive information such as codes, access, and ability to do social engineering to do Money Laundering.

Below sensitive information from the link EXPOSED DXC, CSC, and HEWLETT PACKARD FINANCIALS Document:

Upon completion of the separation of HPE from Hewlett-Packard Company and CSC along with DXC Technology due to exposing Everette Loan agreement, the HPE Board of Directors reviewed the strategic plans for each of the remaining businesses within HPE. At a meeting of the HPE Board of Directors on January 27, 2016, two months following the completion of the separation of HPE and Hewlett-Packard Company, the HPE Board of Directors reviewed and discussed the strategic direction, performance and prospects of HPE, including potential strategic alternatives and strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value as part of HPE’s long-term business plan. Among other strategic alternatives, the HPE management team and Board of Directors discussed a potential separation and potential merger of its non-core software assets, which would eventually lead to an announcement in September 2016 that HPE had entered into definitive agreements for a spin-off and merger of its non-core software assets with Micro Focus in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction valued at approximately $8.8 billion.

On December 16, 2016, Everett entered into the Term Facility and, prior to the closing of the Distribution, Everett intends to issue the Notes to HPE, together in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.0 billion, but what is the purpose and if HP has assets for $60 Billion++ why would they need Notes from Everett. The proceeds of the Term Facility will be used to pay a portion of the Everett Payment to HPE, proceeds from the issuance of $300 million (subject to increase to the extent that the federal income tax basis of the Everett business exceeds $2.3 billion) in principal amount of Notes will be used to pay the remaining portion of the Everett Payment to HPE and approximately $700 million (subject to decrease to the extent that the federal income tax basis of the Everett business exceeds $2.3 billion) in principal amount of the Notes will be issued to HPE. HPE expects to transfer such Notes on or about the close of the Distribution to investment banks and/or commercial banks in exchange for existing HPE debt. Such Notes are expected to be subsequently sold to third-party investors.

the Merger is expected to result in enhanced EBITDA margins and revenue growth opportunities for the combined company with strong free cash flow; and

the Merger is expected to produce first-year synergies of approximately $1.0 billion post-closing, with a run rate of $1.5 billion by the end of year one.

The overall low to high calendar year 2016 estimated EBIT multiples observed for the selected commercial IT services companies were 4.6x to 15.1x and the calendar year 2016 estimated EBIT multiple observed for CSC was 10.4x based on the CSC forecasts. In deriving an approximate implied enterprise value reference range for the Everett Business and an approximate implied per share equity value reference range for CSC, RBC Capital Markets then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2016 estimated EBIT multiples derived from the selected commercial IT services companies of 7.0x to 9.5x to corresponding data of the Everett Business and 8.0x to 11.0x to corresponding data of CSC based on, in the case of the Everett Business, the Everett Business forecasts and, in the case of CSC, the CSC forecasts. These analyses indicated an approximate implied enterprise value reference range for the Everett Business of $8.150 billion to $11.061 billion and an approximate implied equity value reference range for CSC of $23.27 to $37.66 per share. Utilizing the approximate implied enterprise value reference range derived for the Everett Business and the approximate implied per share equity value reference range derived for CSC described above, RBC Capital Markets calculated the following approximate range of implied issuable shares, as compared to the Original Merger Consideration:

The combined company will have a substantial amount of indebtedness following the Transactions, which could materially adversely affect its financial condition.

CSC has a significant amount of indebtedness and its leverage will increase as a result of the Transactions. As of December 30, 2016, CSC had total indebtedness outstanding of approximately $2.9 billion, and the combined company, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, would have had outstanding indebtedness of $7.3 billion (including capital lease obligations).

From the High powered document Everett leases certain real and personal property, which it seems as though HP is having problems and got a Loan term agreement

CSC, HPE, Everett and Merger Sub are parties to a Merger Agreement pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, HPE agreed to effect the Separation and the Distribution due to those Millions of exposed CSC and CSC India 403 Forbidden files that can be accessed due to the glitch into the 13 DNS root zone named servers replicating permissions to over 100 Million servers worldwide affecting all small businesses and large corporations. This will allow me to download all files anywhere from financial docs, data files, security, and other high powered information because System Admins at all of these companies, which server migrations that’s conducted allows permissions to give other servers open access according to the 13 DNS root named servers that’s connected to all servers worldwide ( EXPOSED CSC FILES ON CLOUD COMPUTING NEWS)(EXPOSED ON HACKER NEWS CSC MILLIONS OF FILES)(2017). The way it looks, On December 16, 2016, Everett entered into the Term Facility and prior to the closing of the Distribution and separation because of this DATABREACH, Everett intends to issue the Notes, together in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.0 billion. The proceeds of the Term Facility will be used to pay a portion of the Everett Payment to HPE, proceeds from the issuance of $300 million (subject to increase to the extent that the federal income tax basis of the Everett business exceeds $2.3 billion) in principal amount of Notes will be used to pay the remaining portion of the Everett Payment to HPE and approximately $700 million (subject to decrease to the extent that the federal income tax basis of the Everett business exceeds $2.3 billion) in principal amount of the Notes will be issued to HPE and exchanged by HPE for outstanding senior unsecured notes of HPE. Looking at these sensitive documents it looks like the company is facing hardship to meet certain demands, but with this outburst of news a lot of disadvantage will be in the negative to seize Billions of dollars because of Business confusion due to the exposed Loan agreement, but were would other sources of financing come from ? Will these companies CSC, DXC Technology, and HPE have to sell off assets because of seizures and liquidation process executes however to access of the Loan agreement would give anyone ability to financially steal.|||
