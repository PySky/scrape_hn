A pixel art character generator that delivers in under 10kb, without any JavaScript. The project has been built with Sass and PHP, with shortened class names and IDs for single-use elements. The items themselves were compiled into a PNG sprite sheet and optimised to keep the file size low, with the final result working in just over 7KB with GZIP enabled.
