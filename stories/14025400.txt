ARM has open-sourced a new compute library with GPU support via OpenCL as well as CPU support with NEON usage. This library has basic arithmetic functions but also goes further to offer color manipulation, convolution filters, SVM, SGEMMs, convolutional neural network building blocks, and more.The ARM Compute Library works on both Linux and Android and should help developers in averaging faster mathematical performance on ARM via these CL/NEON-optimized functions.More details on the now MIT-licensed ARM Compute Library via ARM.com while all the code is over on GitHub|||
