Story Highlights The Kamokuna lava delta on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano collapsed and almost all of the structure fell into the sea. The formation was weakened by steam coming from large cracks that appeared in the middle of it.

A lava delta on Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano collapsed, sending almost the entire formation into the surrounding sea.

The phenomenon occurred on May 3 after a large plume of steam began coming from large cracks in the middle of the Kamokuna lava delta, according to a report from the US Geological Survey (USGS).

Lava deltas are most vulnerable to collapsing when their coastal edge extends further into the water, which makes them unstable, USGS scientists wrote. This allows cracks to form.

Loose debris built up underneath the lava delta's edge is not strong enough to support it, which causes the whole structure to collapse. This typically causes seawater and lava to mix, sending plumes of steam into the air.

Steam from Kamokuna’s collapse first appeared between 9:35 and 9:40 a.m. local time and took about 25 minutes to weaken the area and cause it to erode, according to the report.

Between 9:55 and 10 a.m., the lava delta had almost completely vanished into the water, which became muddied with sediment.

The next day, sparse bursts on the coast were seen sending hot lava fragments into the water through the plume.

Though most of the structure was lost, lava flows are reformed when lava enters the ocean and is cooled by waves, which causes them to "freeze" and form a black glass that breaks down to the size of glass and block-sized sediment, according to scientists. This debris slides down a slope under the water and forms an unstable foundation that the lava flows continue to build upon.

In an update on the volcano, scientists said the development of the lava delta has resumed and the lava flow remains active.|||

Officials say it's already begun its rebuilding process.
