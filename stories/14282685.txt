Tell me if this sounds familiar: you go to a conference or meetup or maybe a WordCamp and – hey! – there’s a booth from your favorite hosting provider!  And around the corner is another hosting provider with their booth. And another.  Holy smokes…there are half a dozen hosting providers there all giving away T-shirts and pens and the occasional moleskin notebook!  You know, they’ve got thousands of clients each.  Tens of thousands.  Hundreds of thousands.  And you certainly had the same thought as everyone else reading: If you could only get them to think of you when their clients ask for a developer recommendation you would be home free.  Imagine how many leads they could send you if only they knew what you were about and what made your work special.  Pipeline status: crammed full.

You approach and introduce yourself.  “Hi, I’m **insert your name** and I do **web skill.**”  They respond favorably.  They love your story.  They nod along as you vomit out all the various skills you have, all the clients you’ve wowed, all the great things you know a partnership will mean to Host X.  Well done.  They thank you for coming by.  You give a card.  They give you their card too.  You’re going to talk next week.  A few minutes later you wander off to the next session, Host X branded T-shirt in hand.  That conversation was worth the entire trip, you think.

If you’re familiar with the scenario you can skip ahead since you already know what comes next.  You swap emails. Maybe there’s a phone call.  They introduce you to someone, probably a sales rep at their company interested in ‘partnership.’  Then pretty much nothing ever comes of it.  You certainly don’t get a pipeline full of leads. At least you got that T-shirt and bumper sticker.

Thankfully this is a lesson you’ll probably only have to learn once: hosting companies aren’t going to give you leads based on a conversation you had at an event.  In fact, they probably aren’t going to give you leads at all. Ever.

I’m going to tell you how to get leads from hosting companies but first I want to dispel some myths that are probably clouding your worldview about this issue.

So now that we’ve established that (1) hosting companies don’t have that many referrals to give (2) you were talking to the wrong person, (3) if they do have a referral to give it probably isn’t going to you and (4) they are really interested in flipping the script and getting you to bring them leads, let me tell you what you should have done.

Last fall, my friend Ben of FlowPress sent me a note asking if I had time for a call.  Ben is as tenacious as he is talented but until that day I’m pretty sure I never sent him a single lead in the years we’ve known each other.  And since I can sniff out “let’s be partners!” conversations a mile away, I put Ben off for a few weeks. He finally messaged and said, “Listen, I have something important to show you” so I finally agreed to the chat.

Ben wasn’t lying. As our call started I received an email from him. I opened it as he spoke over the phone.

“Those are the URLs for 20 sites hosted by your company. I’ve attached the GT Metrics reports and some other data for you to review.  Half of them have suffered downtime in the last 60 days. All of them are unacceptably slow. And even though the downtime is almost certainly the result of bad code, if it happens again and they notice they are going to blame their host, which is you.”

And like that, Ben had my full and undivided attention.

“I obviously don’t know what kind of servers these clients are running on, but the slowness might be a reason to upgrade. Maybe you could give them each a call and try for that upsell since they already are your client. All I’ll ask is that you make mention that parts of their code could probably be improved and, if they are interested, you bring us into the conversation.”

How could I say ‘no?’ Ben had brought something of great value to the table – the success of my clients – and offered data that helped me and my team serve those clients better. And all he wanted in exchange was consideration if we discovered the client might benefit from his services? Yes, please, keep it coming.

My team made some calls. Some clients were able to move to a better hosting plan for their needs. Some clients thanked us for the call and decided to handle it in house. And a few were interested in getting in touch with Ben. Our Customer Success team was so thankful for the information he shared that they started bringing his team on calls with other clients who were having trouble. I know that his team worked on a few paid projects with some of our clients in the weeks and months after our initial chat.

If you want other technology companies (including hosts) to help you build your business find a unique and interesting way to show the impact your services can have on their clients and their success. Ben didn’t come to me hat in hand looking for leads just because he believes his team does good work. Instead, he put together a thoughtful strategy to show exactly how his company and mine could mutually benefit from getting past the lip-service and actually partnering for the well-being of clients. Show your partners that you are interested in a mutually beneficial partnership, not a one-way trickle of leads, and that partnership will flourish for everyone involved.|||
