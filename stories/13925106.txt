Just over a month ago, we released Kodi Krypton for all OSMC compatible devices. Since then, we've been working tirelessly to fix bugs, improve performance and listen to your feedback.

OSMC's March update is here, and it comes with a lot of improvements, including the new Kodi Krypton 17.1 release. February has been a jam-packed month, seeing the launch of Vero 4K and the new Raspberry Pi Zero with WiFi.

To get the latest and greatest version of OSMC, simply head to My OSMC -> Updater and check for updates manually on your exising OSMC set up. Of course â€” if you have updates scheduled automatically you should receive an update notification shortly.

If you enjoy OSMC, please follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook and consider making a donation if you would like to support further development.

If you'd like to watch 10-bit H265 content or you've a penchant for 4K content, be sure to check out our new Vero 4K.|||
