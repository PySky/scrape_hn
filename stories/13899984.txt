Google, well-known for hiding Easter eggs in its apps, has a little treat for those of us with an uncontrolled tab-opening habit.

If you reach 100 tabs on the Chrome app, the tab count on the upper right becomes an adorable old school smileyâ€”":)"â€”on iOS and ":D" on Android.

And then, if you do the same using the incognito mode on iOS, you get the same thingâ€”a nice, sweet ":)"

But things get spicier on Android. While we wouldn't presume to know what you do with your incognito tabs, we'll just say the Easter egg here seems... suitable:

That's right, the suggestive winking face: ";)" We see you judging us Google, we see you.

We're not sure why this happens, but we think it may be that the app wasn't designed to have more than two characters in the number of tabs fieldâ€”because what kind of monster has more than a 100 tabs on their phone, anyway? So instead of having three tiny characters in the field, they just switch over to smileys which have two characters. That, or maybe Google just wanted to surprise us!
