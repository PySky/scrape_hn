OpenSnitch is a GNU/Linux port of the Little Snitch application firewall.

Warning: This is still alpha quality software, don't rely on it (yet) for your computer security.

You'll need a GNU/Linux distribution with , and kernel support.

Before opening an issue, keep in mind that the current implementation is just an experiment to see the doability of the project, future improvements of OpenSnitch will include:

Split the project into , and :

OpenSnitch is an application level firewall, meaning then while running, it will detect and alert the user for every outgoing connection applications he's running are creating. This can be extremely effective to detect and block unwanted connections on your system that might be caused by a security breach, causing data exfiltration to be much harder for an attacker. In order to do that, OpenSnitch relies on , an target/extension which allows an userland software to intercept IP packets and either or them, once started it'll install the following iptables rules:

This will use iptables extension to pass all newly created connection packets to NFQUEUE number 0 (the one OpenSnitch is listening on), and then:

This will also redirect DNS queries to OpenSnitch, allowing the software to perform and IP -> hostname resolution without performing active DNS queries itself.

Once a new connection is detected, the software relies on the kernel extension in order to track which PID (therefore which process) is creating the connection.

If is not available for your kernel, OpenSnitch will fallback using the filesystem, even if this method will also work, it's vulnerable to application path manipulation as described in this issue, therefore it's highly suggested to run OpenSnitch on a ftrace enabled kernel.
