Messaging service WhatsApp went down worldwide on Wednesday afternoon.

“WhatsApp is aware of the issue and working to fix it as soon as possible,” a WhatsApp person told Business Insider in an email.

The Facebook-owned messaging app stopped working sometime around 4:50 PM EST, and frustrated users immediately took to Twitter. As of 5:44 PM EST on Wednesday, service had not yet been restored to WhatsApp users.|||
