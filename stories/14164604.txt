Digital Craftsmenâ€™s Automator is a tool that uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies to provide on-demand hosting environments.

AWS provides a web interface to build infrastructure, compute, provide storage and deliver other web services. This is a public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud service.

However, building complex environments by hand is time consuming and many of our clients have similar requirements; multiple networks spanned across two or three AWS Availability Zones (AZs) which are several geographically diverse data centres within each AWS region.

AWS also provides tools to automate the construction of systems (CloudFormation plus cfn-init) and modern Linux operating systems also provide additional tools to orchestrate and control configurations (cloudInitPuppet).

Using such tools, it is possible to create a complex configuration within minutes rather than hours or days.

This process has been packaged into a tool, called DCL Automator.|||
