Investors breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday — for now, anyway.

U.S. stock futures opened sharply higher, with Dow futures soaring more than 200 points as early results from the French election showed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen advancing to a presidential runoff. Those projections were based on exit polls; official results were not yet available.

"The market will enjoy this today, but she's not out," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "The pollsters got it right this time, but we don't know if they'll be wrong in the runoff."

S&P and Nasdaq futures both spiked around 1 percent.

The euro, meanwhile, rose sharply against the dollar on Sunday. "There is some chance that the exit polls are overestimating Macron support," Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, said in a Sunday note.

"But regardless, the worst case outcome of a run-off between Le Pen and far-left Mélenchon has been avoided and no estimate has Le Pen so far ahead of Macron as to increase concerns about his ability to overhaul her in the run-off with the benefit of second choice votes from other mainstream candidates."|||
