OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It is designed to be used with an eye-tracking device to assist with keyboard and mouse control for those living with motor and speech limitations, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, buttons, etc. If you do not have an eye tracking device, OptiKey can be used with a mouse.

OptiKey was written as an accessible alternative to the outrageously expensive, unreliable and difficult to use AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products currently on the market. It is, therefore, fully open-source and free. Forever.

The OptiKey Wiki contains full information on how to get started, system requirements, a user guide, demo videos, a troubleshooting page, and more. Here are some quick links if you're in a hurry:

OptiKey targets the .Net 4.6 Framework, which is available for Windows Vista SP2 onwards. It was designed to run on Windows 8/ 8.1/ 10.
