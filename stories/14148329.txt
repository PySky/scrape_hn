This is the website which is dedicated to git and social coding. I am going to share some commands involving github with you.

You can fork another repository of GitHub by going to a repository page and clicking on fork at the top. This will create a copy of that project under your GitHub account.

You can then create a local copy of the remote repo by typing th following command: (You can find your clone url by opening your repo on GitHub and looking at top-right corner)

The above command will create a local copy of the remote repo. You can make changes to it and then after committing those changes to the local repository you can push them to the remote repository.

This command has a lot of purposes but I will show you the most-used one. Suppose you have made a LOT of similar commits into a repository while testing some code and now you want to merge those commits into one. You can do that by doing a . It is easy. Just type: (replacing n with the amount of last commits you want to modify)

This will present you with something of this sort.

If you want to squash (merge) these 4 commits into a single commit then you have to change the last three to . It would become something like this:

Now you can save the file and you will be presented with a screen where you can create a new commit message.

If you want to push a rebased repo online then you have to do something a bit different. You have to do a push. It can be done like this:

The + sign tells git to force push the repo. Alternatively you can also do this:

And that's it! I hope you enjoyed this short intro to the world of git :)|||
