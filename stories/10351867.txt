Many were very sad when google chose not to update Nexus 4 to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. This simple guide will show you how to build Android 6.0 Marshamllow for Nexus 4. You'll be amazed how simple it is. And for the lazy, I also have a pre-built AOSP Marshmallow image set to download on the bottom of this page. Also, LTE works in this set of images :) Since Nexus 4 was originally a Google-Play-equipped device, you can legally install Google Apps on this image and enjoy a full Google Android 6.0 experience on your Nexus 4. That part, however, is up to you to do yourself. I am not offering GApps downloads here.

Download patches if you want to make the build yourself: => [ PACKAGE YOU'LL NEED mirror )] <=Or, a full working image, including the LTE radio image => [ WORKING IMAGE mirror )] <= It is fully usable userdebug image. Tested: sensors, NFC, WiFi, Bluetooth, Camera, Cell, GPSPlase do not re-host this elsewhere and claim them as your work.|||
