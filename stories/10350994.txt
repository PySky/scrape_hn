ConceptNet is a proud part of the ecosystem of Linked Open Data.

As a modern Linked Open Data resource, the data in ConceptNet is available in a JSON-LD API, a format that aims to make linked data easy to understand and easy to work with. If you don't care what JSON-LD is, it's just a JSON REST API with some extra metadata.

You can use ExternalURL links in ConceptNet to find the same terms in other vocabularies, such as WordNet, DBPedia, and OpenCyc, which can provide you with other forms of information.

For information on how to use the ConceptNet API, see the API documentation. Or just start browsing it and you'll probably figure it out.|||
