For a few weeks I have Linux Mint 18.1 installed on my laptop. I am still in school and started a new project. With that project we use onedrive on a Office 365 platform. On my laptop I use the latest Firefox 52 browser and strictly work in Word online since document compatibilty is always an issue while working in a team.

Sadly enough I experienced a lot of performance issues while browsing the directory and working on a document. As I also have a desktop running Windows 10 and the same Firefox 52 browser I tried working on that and see if the problem persists. But no. The problem was no more.

Then I began thinking and trying a few different things. On of the first ideas I came up with was changing the user-agent string. I changed the user-agent string to the following.

I the following extension in Firefox to change it.

After changing the user-agent the performance problems were resolved. The UI of OneDrive worked flawlessly. The only thing in the user-agent changed was the OS. At first I thought this was a random occurance but no. I changed back to the normal user-agent and the problem came back.

My friend who also had this problem used the same method as I did with the same results.

So by writing this I hope to get to know if people also have this issue.

So my friend pointed out that he had no problems with Onedrive for Business anymore. I changed my own user-agent back to normal. And the problem was resolved at my end as well.

It turns out that a member of the Onedrive team spotted that there was this particular issue. Check out the first comment|||
