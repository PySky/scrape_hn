Why do we need to guest post, can a guest post bring more traffic to your new website, the answer is yes. you don't need any paid tools or coding tactics skills to go about this strategy, what you need is a decent website and a passion to write, expert always say that guest post is not helpful, but when it come to time to get more traffic, they rather Â just say you should join facebook or go on Pinterest.

before using Guest posting to bring traffic to your website, you have to write a really good article on your site and I strongly recommend setting up Google Analytics on your website before you use guest posting.

I would NOT try to submit to all of them. Test out a few, track the results and then get on a schedule with the ones that work. Maybe you can talk to the author and see if you can submit 1 guest post per week to them. If you can do that with 5 blogs every week, you will get a ton of traffic!|||
