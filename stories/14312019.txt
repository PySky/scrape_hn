During the earnings call Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel also spoke about how the company values and delivers its products with creativity and creation in mind, seeing the DAUs as a “function of creation”. This is one of the main reasons why the company doesn’t use alerts and notifications to encourage users to get back into the app but rather relies on Snapchat users to create great content and share it with their friends and family.

Evan Spiegel has also highlighted the importance of “removing friction from creative process” and lowering barriers to content creation which is what the app’s recent UI refresh supports.
