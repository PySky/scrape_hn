The FinTech Academy Africa is going to launch in South Africa on 24 and 25 April 2017. It will be targeting C-Level executives who want a "deep dive" into understanding the best practices in FinTech but have limited time to do so.

As part of the FinTech Academy, South Africa's Blockchain Academy will also be presenting some training on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.

"Board directors and Executive Committee members are increasingly being called upon to make far reaching strategic business decisions in areas affected by rapidly developing disruptive technology. The curriculum of the FinTech Academy has been specifically developed to fast-track their knowledge, support decision-making and also to future proof their careers." said Ian Merrington CEO of The Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative (CiTi).

The organizers says that the academy's curriculum has been designed to provide an understanding of "key areas of FinTech which would normally take between nine months and a year to attain in normal working circumstances".

Nicole Anderson CEO and Co-founder of FinTech Circle added: "We have taken particular care to adapt the curriculum to be of relevance to executives who are based in Africa. South Africa and the rest of the continent present a number of unique and exciting opportunities for the use of FinTech, particularly in areas of FinTech convergence."  This curriculum will be based on the international bestselling The FinTech Book and is a first for the continent.

The FinTech Academy Africa is a partnership between London based, FinTech Circle and CiTi, based in South Africa, and follows on from a recent successful collaboration to create specialised FinTech incubation support programs.
