We’re committed to making Uber a great place to work, no matter where you come from. That’s why we’re working to ensure that Uber is an inclusive environment for everyone, and that we recruit, develop and retain people from communities that are typically underrepresented in the tech sector.

We’re dedicating $3 million over the next three years to support organizations working to bring more women and underrepresented people into tech. This year, our recruiting team is also embarking on a college tour to recruit talented students at colleges across the country, including a number of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Our employee resource groups play a huge role in all our recruiting events that are focused on hiring women and people of color at Uber.

We’ll be actively involved in the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, and we’re expanding our engineering workshops as part of a broader set of summer immersion projects which will focus on topics like robotics, animation and data structures.

In 2017, we’re proud to be participating in the Disability Equality Index, a joint venture by the American Association of People with Disabilities and the U.S. Business Leadership Network. The DEI helps make businesses more inclusive for people with disabilities, and we look forward to working with other organizations in this field.|||

At Uber, we’re committed to creating a workplace that is as diverse as the cities we serve. Learn more about how we're making Uber a better company—not just for our employees, but our customers too.
