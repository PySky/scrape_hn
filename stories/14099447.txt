I’m attempting to raise $1k in a week via Kickstarter to fix the OpenStreetMap Stats site.

The site lets you explore OSM data by country, time and data type:

Sadly it’s suffered bit rot and some countries are broken and not updating. The $1k goes toward fixing, open sourcing and hosting it for a year or two. Else, it gets canned.

So far it’s raised $163 with 6 days to go.|||
