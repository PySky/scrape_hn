some recent changes to node (7.6.0) make it more convenient to debug your code.

most importantly, there is now a –inspect-brk flag which saves you from typing –inspect –debug-brk. that alone will save hours of working time globally! ;)

another interesting change is that debuggable node-processes are now showing up under chrome://inspect. unfortunately this opens the debugger in a new window. if you copy the devtools-link printed by the node process you can open the debugger in a tab, which proved easier to use for me so far.|||
