We’re excited to announce that Altium’s free PCB design tool, CircuitMaker, has just released a new version (Beta 5) which integrates Octopart’s database for component selection and supply chain information!

It’s been one month since Octopart became part of Altium, and in that month our teams have been hard at work bringing Octopart’s capabilities into CircuitMaker. We’ve flown folks back and forth between NYC and La Jolla in order to release this capability before Maker Faire NYC this past weekend.

It was great meeting so many of you and talking about your design workflows, your preferred software tools, and what we can do to improve the state of electronics design for open hardware. Come visit CircuitMaker and Octopart at Maker Faire San Diego on October 3rd and 4th and Maker Faire Rome on October 16th, 17th, and 18th. We’ll see you at the booth!|||
