Amazon Web Services is set to take on Microsoft, IBM, SAP, Tableau Software and others in the lucrative business intelligence arena with the release this week of a new tool — code-named Space Needle — that will allow companies to better analyze data, reports The Wall Street Journal.

The Journal notes that the new tool could help Amazon Web Services expand its user base beyond technical workers, targeting potential business managers and marketers who use data to make better decisions about their companies’ products and services.

The big AWS re:Invent conference is taking place in Las Vegas from Oct. 6-9 where an announcement could be made.

Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is set up well to take a bite out of the business intelligence market as more companies rely on internal and external data to make key decisions.

Microsoft made a big move into the business intelligence arena this past summer with the release of its new Power BI software and service, and fast-growing Seattle-based Tableau Software which continues to expand its offerings.|||
