Today we’re proud to announce the Segment Open Fellowship. The Fellowship is a three month long program supporting three to five open-source developers with $8k per month to focus full-time on their project, no other strings attached.

Since the very beginning, open-source has played a critical role in Segment’s journey. As we’ve grown, we’ve continued to try and create useful tools and utilities that we open source to continue giving back to the community that gave us our start. As Segment scales, we’d like to continue scaling our support for the open-source community even beyond our internal needs.

We’ll award grants to 3-5 developers to work on an open-source project for 3 months. They can work out of our office in SF or remotely. We’re hoping to give them a chance to accelerate the adoption of a new, fast-growing project.

The primary goal of the fellowship is to enable participants to fully dedicate themselves to a project for a few months. We’re hoping to give them a chance to speed the adoption of a new, fast-growing project. Or maybe help them build some long-awaited key features of a library that’s already widely used. Or perhaps even jump-start an entirely new idea altogether.

It’s certainly an experiment–but one which we believe has the potential to benefit developers all over the world. And we couldn’t be more excited to help support progress in the open-source community.
