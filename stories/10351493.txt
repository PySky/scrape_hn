Researchers have developed nanostructures that could pave the way for touchless interactive displays. Scientists led by Bettina Lotsch at Stuttgart’s Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research and LMU Munich created the materials that change electrical and optical properties when a finger comes near them by using a moisture sensor that can detect sweat on human skin.|||
