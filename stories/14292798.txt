Most startups have a hard time doing initial customer development because of the chicken and egg problem.

Everyone is a potential customer based on their interests, day job, or past experience.

We think there might be an opportunity to put together teaching customers and startups that wish to learn from them.

The way this will work is that potential customers will make one or several 30 minute blocks of time available at a minimum price.

Startups will bid on and buy the blocks.

You may either keep the money or direct it to your charity of choice.|||
