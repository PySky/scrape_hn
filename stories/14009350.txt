Enigma encrypted message to be sent in 40m In cooperation with Bletchley Park, the Heinz Nixdorf Museum DLØHNF in Paderborn, Germany is hosting a cipher event on April 7 

 

 A Google translation of the DARC post reads: 

 

 As with the first event of this kind ten years ago, an encrypted message is sent over radio, to which radio amateurs are invited, to follow them and to play with them. This time, however, the message is not generated with a Lorenz machine, but with an enigma and then transmitted in encrypted telegraphy to 40 m from the club station of the Heinz Nixdorf Mueseum, DLØHNF.

 

 DLØHNF will open radio stations with other stations, which also use historical technology and thus recreate a historical radio network, between the transmissions of various encrypted messages - which are specially approved for this event. DLØDM and DLØAFM are also involved. The activities in Bletchley Park go back to the mathematician Alan Turing, who during the Second World War succeeded in decoding the Enigma coded radio spoofs of the Germans with his Turing machine. 

 

 In the Heinz Nixdorf Museum you can watch the happenings from 9 o'clock on the spot. Visitors experience encryption with the Enigma, the Morse as well as a live transmission.

 

 A precise frequency for the transmission of the CW transmission from 9:30 is not known. The museum information is at
