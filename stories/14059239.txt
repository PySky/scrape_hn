A “Magento report panel” asks for a Пароль (password), so we can’t enter. But in the page source (beautified JS here) are some clues about its evil intentions:

Apparently somebody has built a sophisticated dashboard to manage bruteforce Magento hacking operations! It seems to show the daily progress on hacked Magento stores and it has a GUI method to mark found servers as “success”. Also, it can be used to log in to the backend of hacked stores.

I checked my forensic notes of previous cases and found that this dashboard was used in at least one other case. Sysadmins, check your server logs!

I wonder if the culprit has bruteforce protection on his own management panel. Wouldn’t it be a nice gesture if the bruteforcer got bruteforced? Now, I won’t do that, as it is not allowed in my country. But if you happen to live in a place where that is not the case (anyone from Belize?), you could use something like this (educational disclaimer, yadie yada):

In Dutch we have a very applicable saying:|||
