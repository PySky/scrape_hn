The power frequency resonance device has great advantages in the aspects of test power supply capacity, equipment weight, test waveform and investment. The device is mainly designed for the AC voltage withstand test of the generator with a capacity of 250MW or less. Specific methods of operation are as follows:

With the development of power system , the capacity of the

the current relay should be adjusted to 5A.

is 50A, the configuration of the transformer is 50/5,

Over current protection setting, 1.2 times the rated current of high voltage side of transformer.

voltage protection settings, according to the test voltage 1.1 times set.

When the test voltage is 39kV, the display should be adjusted to 43kV.

ll wire must be connected, firm and reliable.

The divider wire is connected to the high voltage current

is connected to the high voltage current two terminal o

Pressure time setting: set the test time on the time relay to the required test time.

According to the above connection

t this time if the regulator is not zero, the regulator will automatically return to zero. Do not turn on the main power
