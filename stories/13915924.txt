Last year, we said Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality would blow up, and we saw some ingenious uses of these technologies. Related products were highlights of the expo, and many speakers focused on the intersection of immersive storytelling and VR/AR/MR. Innovators are now using this technology to sell homes, share immersive journalism, enhance music experiences, explore space, and push the boundaries of cinema.

On the heels of an administration change, there was a surprisingly large spotlight on social and political issues. Van Jones, Joe Biden, the NYT, and others tackled controversial issues and encouraged renewed action from attendees. Journalists also discussed the risk of pushing the boundaries of privacy and going beyond ethical storytelling in the wake of new technological developments.

Connected hardware is near and dear to us at Viget, and we were happy to see it all over Austin. From meetups to sessions to events, we saw IoT lovers everywhere. Eager innovators were looking to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds (s/o to our friends at SparkFun!). Covering everything from industrial production, cooking, and home security, there were some seriously smart products that got us thinking about our next projects!|||
