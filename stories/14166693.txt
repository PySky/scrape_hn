The desktop lockdown is a way to simplify the use of a computer dedicated to a single task. The possibility to use only dedicated programs will make it difficult to users to compromise the system, whether intentionally or not.

This configuration is useful whenever you want to create an information kiosk, a point of sale or other systems used by people in a public place. In the office it can make easier to use a thin client-type remote access workspace; it can also be useful in order to configure a computer dedicated to the control of a machine. Basically, with the desktop lockdown we want an autologin account, which performs only certain applications, to be present in Windows.

There are various ways to achieve this result, depending on your operating system. In this article we will go through two different ways of doing it: setting the registry keys in Windows, and using Praim Agile Mode.

Windows 10 Enterprise and Education have the AppLocker feature to facilitate the setup of a dedicated computer.

For example, using the following script you can make sure that when the user closes the program the PC will be turned off:

A quicker and comprehensive tool, which presents also many other possibilities, can be found in Praim Agile.

 You can lockdown the desktop without the need to perform on the PC the configurations mentioned above. In addition, the software provides a well-structured launcher and the opportunity to change the configuration by using the ThinMan management console.|||
