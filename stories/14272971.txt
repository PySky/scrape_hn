MTN Nigeria have apparently let go of 280 employees as part of the telecommunicartions company's voluntary severance scheme.

These lay-offs come after earlier this year MTN Group, MTN Nigeria's holding company, declared its first loss in two decades citing, among other reasons, the fine imposed on the company by the Nigerian Communications Comission.

According to a report the affected employees were those that had already been permanently employed by MTN Nigeria for five or more years.

Those who decided to leave under the voluntary severance scheme are said to have been paid the equivalent of their three weeks gross salary for every year they worked with MTN Nigeria.

Before the lay offs, MTN Nigeria were rumored to be employing approximately 1,800 people permanently.|||
