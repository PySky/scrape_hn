So far we received about 35 applications for the Pitch Competition at our EU-Startups Conference 2015 which will be held on October 23 at the Rainmaking Loft Berlin.

Since some of the startups didn’t fit our criteria, and since we really want to have the best selection of startups as possible, we’ve only chosen 12 startups yet and decided to start a final call (deadline: 6th of October)!

While the participating founders (up to 15 startup teams) will get some valuable feedback from an expert jury of well known investors, the winner will receive:

Aside of this prize, which has a total value of over €2,500, the winning startup will be prominently featured by us (EU-Startups.com) and probably by a few other publications as well.

Apply now: If you’re interested in pitching your startup idea with a 3-minute-presentation in front of an interested audience (up to 150 people) of investors, startup enthusiasts and an expert jury, please contact us (Thomas@EU-Startups.com). Tell us about your business model and the current stage of your startup (4-5 sentences) or send us a short pitch deck! -> The final application deadline is the 6th of October!

Precondition: Your startup should be in pre-seed or seed stage, not older than 2 years, should have raised no VC funding yet (or less than €500K) and has to be based in Europe.

Tickets: If you’re planning to attend this year’s EU-Startups Conference, we highly recommend you purchase your ticket now! We kept it affordable: The two ticket categories we’re offering (€29/€59) already include food and drinks during our networking break (sponsored by AWS and Hiscox). Tickets can be purchased here!|||
