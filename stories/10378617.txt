Ok, so last week’s stop gap strip ended up as the *only* strip. I’ve not been making enough time for ELER recently, but I promise to do better from now on.

And thanks for all the supportive comments and e-mails. I’ve also gained a few “insider” contacts this week, who’ve been telling me some hilarious ESR stories which I’m sure I can incorporate somewhere. Keep them coming.|||
