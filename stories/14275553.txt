An Android app which finds wrong, incomplete or extendable data in the user's vicinity and provides the tools to complete these easily and directly on site without having to use another editor.

The found issues are presented to the user as markers on a map (like i.e. in Osmose) that each are solvable by filling out a simple form to complete/correct the information on site. The user's answer is then processed and directly uploaded into the OSM database in meaningful changesets in the name of the user's OSM account. Since the app is meant to be used on a survey, it can be used offline and otherwise aims to be economic with data usage.

The app is aimed at users who do not know anything about OSM tagging schemes but still want to contribute to the OpenStreetMap by surveying their neighbourhood (or other places as well). Because of the target group, only those quests are shown which are answerable very clearly by asking one simple question and only those quests are created which contain very few false positives.



 Also available in the IzzyOnDroid F-Droid repository (usually has faster updates).

Right now, there are very few different question types. More will be added over time.

You can help translate this app over here:

If you would like to help and are able to contribute code, you are most welcome. I have a few tasks in mind that would be very helpful for the project, some of which do not require knowledge about the current code base. So best get in touch with me.

Otherwise, there are many reasonable feature requests and ideas for new question types in the issue tracker which you could also engage yourself with. If you have own ideas how to improve this app and want to make sure that I will merge your Pull Request, I suggest you open an issue first in which the feature can be discussed.

Finally, using it, testing it and giving constructive feedback is also a valuable contribution.
