Android Snooper is a HTTP inspector which observes all the HTTP calls made by the app and opens up an Activity to see the detailed history of HTTP calls on event. This library is inspired by the feature of FLEX app for iOS.

Android Snooper works on the interceptor mechanism provided by almost every HTTP client. All you need to do is initialize Android Snooper using statement in your Application class and set an instance of to the list of your network interceptors. As of now we are providing the interceptors for the below libraries.

Didn't get your HTTP client's name in the list? No worries, You can still write your own implementation by using core module and let Android Snooper know about the request being made. Below is given a dummy implementation.

The above implementation ought to be part of your custom interceptor where you will have access to the required and object to jot down the required data for Android Snooper to work properly.

Warning: As Android Snooper records each and every HTTP call goes through it. Please be cautious as it will record the sensitive information such as Auth Tokens, Headers etc. The only purpose of this library is Debugging. Hence, Debug or QA builds are the only perfect candidate for this library.

Snapshot versions are available in Sonatype's snapshots repository.

If you would like to contribute code to you can do so by forking the repository and create a Pull request. You can also create an Issue to report bugs or features that you want to see in library.|||
