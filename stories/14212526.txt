This tool is based on the example, C-based webserver program "weblite" by Dr. Ken Christensen. The intent of this program is to keep the spirit of weblite (simple, and direct), while adding the minimal needed additions to make the code a standalone program (e.g., help message, license file, debugging, and some exception handling).

Mostly, this is a proof of concept I plan to use with my Raspberry Pi.|||
