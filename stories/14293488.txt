The title of this post promises so much doesn’t it? Well, guess what, it’s all possible. I’m here to help with goal setting.

 (Does anyone else finish “if you can dream it” with a rather famous R Kelly song? I did. That shows how cultured I am. I’m all about Space Jam)

  break

 Do not be afraid to dream big!

  break

 I’m a dreamer, always have been and always will be.

  break

 I am constantly thinking of ideas and I have notebooks full of craft project ideas and blog posts.

  break

 How do I figure out which ones to pursue?

  break

 I ask why.

  break

 Why am I doing this and how does it get me closer to my end goal?

  break

 Of course, I don’t always do things because they’re moving me towards a specific goal.

  break

 

  break

break

 Meditating, journaling and yoga make me happy. They’re good for my mental health, which in turn is good to keep me on track to achieve goals in other areas of my life.

  break

 When you set a goal, think about the end goal and why you want to achieve it.

  break

break

 If your goal is to go to the Bahamas, but it means you have to work longer hours in a crappy job, what should you do?

  break

 Get a stunning picture of the Bahamas and set it as wallpaper on all your electronics.

  break

 Print out a stock photo of the Bahamas.

  break

 What do you need to get to the Bahamas?

  break

break

 How do you get more money?

  break

 Is your goal to quit that crapola job and work from home?

  break

 Take some time to meditate or at least relax and visualise how you want your future to look.

  break

 Do you want to have a fantastic home office?

  break

 Space where you are constantly motivated and happy to be in?

  break

 Find some amazing craft rooms and post them up on your walls to remind you, that is where you want to be.

  break

 Remember that you are 100% more likely to achieve your goal if you are really excited about the outcome. (Full disclosure, I completely made that percentage up. But I believe it! Is that enough?!)

  break

 

  break

break

 If you apply a timeframe to your action steps, then you’re flying sunshine!

  break

 The more detailed your actionable steps are, the more likely you are to be successful.

  break

 Not setting actionable steps means that you are simply going to fail.

  break

 Set actionable steps/short term goals that will help you reach your big goal.

  break

break

 The truth is, if you don’t set the steps above and accept that you might fail, you are going to be so disappointed.

  break

 For example; people who think that new years resolutions don’t work.

  break

 The reason they don’t work is that people treat it as a wish list more than a “goals they will actually achieve” list.

  break

 You may have guessed by now, but I’m a #goalgetter.

  break

 I set goals every quarter.

  break

 Then I review said goals at the end of every quarter.

  break

 Reassess and adjust my goals accordingly.

  break

break

 If your goal is to start a blog and start earning money within three months, that gives you 12 weeks to plan.

  break

 Download your free blog planner right here or sign up and start your blog in seven days! Or… Three weeks.

  break

 It is entirely possible to do that.

  break

 I did it with this very blog.

  break

 It was my goal in January to start this blog, fill it with content and launch it before the end of the first quarter.

  break

 Done.

  break

 Now it’s time to set goals for the next quarter that will be reviewed at the end of the four months.

  break

break

 It baffles me how people expect to achieve anything when it isn’t written down and visible.

  break

 If something isn’t in front of me and I’m not reminded of it, I forget all about it.

  break

 Sometimes my home office is more like a scene from Memento, but that’s because I struggle with memory problems due to chronic medical conditions (you can read all about them right here).

  break

 Despite my memory problems, my medical conditions and my disability I am still crushing goals.

  break

 So why the fudge aren’t you?

  break

 If I can do it, you certainly can.

  break

break

 Have you ever written a list of goals you’d love to achieve and it ends up looking like a grocery list?

  break

 I’ve done that.

  break

 And instantly felt overwhelmed.

  break

 At that stage, I wouldn’t be surprised if you abandoned your list altogether.

  break

 But it’s okay, it’s just a starting off point.

  break

break

 At the grocery list stage, you want to determine which of your goals are most important.

 break

 To do this, you need to go back to step one and ask why.

 break

 Why are you setting your goal?

 break

 What is your overall goal?

 break

 Is it to make more money?

 break

 Then your first goal should be to do whatever will make you the most money immediately. And organise from there.

 break

 I find that at this stage, it is best to make a priorities matrix.

 break

 I use a huge poster board like this, and these multicoloured neon post-its,washi tape and a sharpie.

 break

break

 What does success mean in relation to the goal you want to set?

 break

 Is your goal to have a blog, with content, ready to launch?

 break

 Is it having your first 1k in blog traffic?

 break

 You need to figure out what will equal success.
