The responses were surprising. For one thing, women who participated in the design research would project gender and personality on to our bot. In moments of frustration, the bot was referred to as a “he,” when, in fact, the messages were coming from our female colleague. For another, not only did the women want to share their activities, they also wanted to share their failures. For them, fitness wasn’t purely about achieving a goal, but also the process it took to get there.

The best way to understand what a conversation needs to be is by starting it. Figure out tone of voice, pacing, and interactions  as it unfolds. It’s possible to make conversations feel more personal with only a few data points. Be intentional and creative. Every participant will project an identity onto the bot — regardless of whether the design team gave it one. Bots allow for a nuanced interaction that might bring surprising elements to your product. Be willing to pivot in response to happy accidents.

During the past few years, the interaction design and design research teams at IDEO New York have worked closely with real people to test value propositions and the desirability of digital products and services. Together, we built ad-hoc tools that helped us design conversations with users, and engage with them in real-life contexts.

As we planned and ran these prototypes, we developed a set of principles we now rely on in our research.

A prototype is a question, embodied. What are you trying to learn? Who are you learning from? Hack existing tools. There’s no need to build from scratch. Iterate in real-time. The beauty of SMS is that you can adapt quickly. Be explicit about the intentions of your work, and make sure that your actions are in line with the ethics of field research Consider all the stories, anecdotes, and insights you gathered through your chatbot to inspire the design.|||
