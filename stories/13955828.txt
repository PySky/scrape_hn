In this tutorial we will change the router settings to obtain better WiFi performance than with the default settings. First we will explain how to do the performance analysis and then we will start tunning the router for maximum WiFi speed.

This tutorial will also work for different Linux distribution, but the opkg command should be change to fit your linux distro.

We are goint to use iperf to measure the performance, install it with opkg:

With the last command we started the iperf server on the router. You will need also the iperf command on the client side.

On the client side execute (check the router ip address to match yours):

Out perfomance measure will be done on a 5ghz WiFi. The output should be similar to this:

We are going to enable the following options (all disabled by default):

We also are going to increase the channel width to 40mhz witht he HT40+ option.

Out final config should be similar to this one, remeber to keep you option path:|||
