A responsive project landing page built upon Bootstrap which I have handcrafted for one of my projects Markdownify.

Perfect for the Open Source projects which can be described within a single page with a nice screenshot. Such as GitHub Pages and as it is built upon Bootstrap, it can be customizable pretty easily according to your liking.

Take a look at the demo.

Fork it and play with it!|||
