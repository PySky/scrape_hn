Hi and thanks for visiting my blog. 🙂

Today I’d like to share a great (and new) demo for the ZX Spectrum that I discovered on Pouet.net.

The demo is called Ultraviolet and was created by the demo group Hooy-Program. All code, music and design by Gasman.

Ultraviolet was released at the Forever 2017 party in Horná Súča, Slovakia, where it ranked 1st in the demo competition. You can find the download, as well as more information here:

It contains many cool effects and its incredible to see all the strange things one can program the ZX to do. 🙂 Hope you will enjoy the demo as much as I did!|||
