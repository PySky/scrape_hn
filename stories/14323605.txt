Announcing a new developer tool, the Cortana Capability Set, which will allow developers to enter Cortana a year ago, and was expected to release a new general preview of the kit in February.

 The Harman Kardon Invoke loudspeaker with Cortana inside will be at Microsoft stores this fall. Interestingly, the speaker will support hands-free calling via Skype, which allows users to make calls to mobile devices running the Microsoft messaging platform. It was not just open to a wide range of third party applications. Due to unknown reasons, the release was delayed and in the Build 2017 developer talk Microsoft released today the Cortana Capability Kit as a public preview.

Developers will be able to create Cortana skills with the Cortana Skills Kit and use a Microsoft Bot Frame transformation with the same pretty single click with a Kik Yada FeySbuk Messenger bot turned into a frame.

Early talent development partners include Expedia, Capital One, and the house-to-house company TalkLocal. The other sessions will continue for the next two days on the topic of voice-centered experiences and work-oriented practices. You can ask Alexa to play music via Spotify, send a text message via Yada AT & T, and even that does not surface.

“We are excited to partner with Harman Kardon to create a speaker that combines superior sound and stylish design with Cortana’s intelligence,” said Jordi Ribas, CVP from Microsoft AI Products. Jones says, “Cortana can respond to content based on the device I’m on.”|||
