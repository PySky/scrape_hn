Do you believe that street objects, museum collections, or exhibition booths can 'speak to you' via your smart device? Or that smartphone can help us interact with our immediate surroundings? Did you also know that you don't need to install an extra mobile app for that?

Several years ago Google launched the Physical Web, a Google Chrome open source project to help people discover the world around them. What Physical Web does - it enables smartphone users to see an URL leading to a web page with an advertising or informational content, which was broadcasted by a nearby BLE beacon.

Testing of this scenario on an iOS device is quite simple since it does not require any dedicated mobile application (only Google Chrome).

To start the evaluation, please:

Eddystone-URL - is a Google Eddystone frame which allows transmission of a link (URL) to an iOS or Android smart device (learn more about Proximity Technologies).

In order for an URL to be displayed in the iOS widget, a user has to:

As a result, every time you approach the pre-configured for Eddystone-URL use beacon, you will see a notification with an advertised link.

The list of use cases for Physical Web application is enormous. Exhibitions, museums, amusement parks are only some of the venues which possess great potential for this solution.

However, let's take a closer look at a Smart City concept, where the technologies are used to optimize asset management and enhance comfort levels for both city residents and guests.



 The Physical Web gave us tools to fulfill any content- and location-related idea. So, now it is our turn to drive adoption of the technology in everyday's life and share information about the benefits we get.
