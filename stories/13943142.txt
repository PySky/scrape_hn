With a Family Profile, charges incurred are billed to the payment method associated with that profile. Weâ€™ll email you a copy of the trip receipt.



When your teen selects a vehicle option (uberX, uberXL, etc.), the price displayed in the app before they request a ride is the fare they'll be charged at the end of the trip. These fares are calculated dynamically, based on the pickup location and destination. As is the case with all Uber trips, if demand for rides is high when your teen requests a ride, the trip fare will reflect that. Please note the booking fee Uber collects for teen trips may be higher in your city than the standard booking fee.|||

Uber connects your teen to a safe, reliable ride in minutes.  They stay on the go. You stay in the know. And everyone gets more from their day.
