Developers can automatically create containerized development environments with the workspace management capabilities of Eclipse Che. OSIO creates environments, using your favorite technology stacks, that are hosted in a container on OpenShift Online. OpenShift.io integrates the Jenkins Pipeline plugins to give developers a complete library allowing them to assemble their build pipeline. You can create the simplest ‘just build it’ pipeline or add promotions between environments as well as human approval steps. Pipeline definitions are written using a Groovy DSL providing huge flexibility in how you assemble the pieces into of pipelines. Together, these capabilities reduce resource drag during development and deployment.|||
