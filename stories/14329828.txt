First, the only color option available as of now, is Black; and its actual price is $621.99, while with this pre-orders, the price is amazingly discounted to $449. But unfortunately, the shipping detail hasn’t been disclosed yet.

Whereas in the GearBeast, almost all the specifications are the same, but in addition, they have revealed some more features, in further to the prior one. Correspondingly, the device has the dimensions, 6.01 x 2.94 x 0.28 inches, weighing 156 grams. Furthermore, here an Arrival Notice Button is also featured. The price tag here is $689, which is somewhat higher than the Geekbuying’s.
