HTTPS seems to be everywhere these days, including GitHub. Itâ€™s great to see the security of the Web improved, but sometimes this comes at a cost. Recently I wanted to actually fetch and test my own repository for bootstrapping my storage box from Synology:

The DS214play model which I have comes with the program without HTTPS, so doing a command line bootstrapping is difficult. This is one of this weird chicken-and-egg problems we sometimes experience, and to test my software releases published on GitHub, I wrote this simple thing, which lets me fetch the release and do further bootstrapping and testing:

Oh, and GitHub Gists are HTTPS too, so to actually get it, I had to transfer the content through PasteBin;

Why like that? Well in the middle of testing it, I learned that: Pastebin adds DOS new-line separators at the end snippets|||

Bootstrapping a system on a UNIX distribution where not all the tools are installed and those installed are out-of-date can be challenging. I've missed `wget` on Synology distro, and I show how you can work-around it.
