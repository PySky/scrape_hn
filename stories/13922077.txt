There are lot's of great open sourced contracts for freelancers. I'm a big fan of Andy Clarke's "Contract Killer" and Ashe Dryden's take on Andy's contract. I've taken a mix of both of them and added my own modifications; the iOS version support, device support and payment terms.

You can find my version of the contract here.|||
