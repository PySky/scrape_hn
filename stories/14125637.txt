Cerebro is an open alerting system over Graphite , the opensource timeseries database. The service layer currently integrates with Seyren to store alarms, schedule checks and send alerts. (More backends in the future.)

Cerebro provides a service layer (REST API) and a dashboard (Web UI) to make alerting over various types of metrics more accessible to Graphite non-experts. It is dedicated to DevOps teams monitoring their product/services.

Whereas still a beta, we already use Cerebro over various types of production metrics: system, applicative, business. We have teams and users, from ops to developers as well as product owners, which find it useful as a general-purpose open alerting service. That is why we chose to share Cerebro with the community, even though there is (much) place for improvements: scalability, resilience, API, integrations…​|||
