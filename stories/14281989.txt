F*EX (Frams' Fast File EXchange) is a service to send big (large, huge, giant, ...) files from a user A to a user B.

The sender uploads the file to the F*EX server using a WWW upload form and the recipient automatically gets a notification e-mail with a download-URL.

For example, you want to send your colleague your last lab data set (1 GB). You have the following possibilities (and problems):

Out of the question - we live in the year 48 after invention of the internet! Sending media (hardware) is for grandpas. Most e-mail servers have a limit of 10 MB per e-mail and a storage-quota of a few 100 MB per user or even less. Why not cuneiform writing on stone plates? You have your communication partners password or you are willing to give him yours - just for a file transfer? Using which account, which password? You do not mind sending unencrypted passwords and files over the insecure internet? In case of anonymous ftp: Does it allow 1 GB uploads? Does it allow to delete the upload afterwards? Who else can download your file? Who else can delete your file? You have to send your friend the download-URL, he has to inform you about the successful download, you have to delete it afterwards. 

 All in all: a pain in the ass. No default upload and user management - must be programmed Very few http servers can handle files greater than 2 GB You run UNIX and have sendfile installed? Your recipient runs UNIX and has sendfile installed? Neither you nor your recipient has a firewall blocking port 487? What limit do they have (most: < 2 GB)? What about security and privacy: will your files be save and secure? Are they open source based or closed proprietary? Are they accessible with any browser or do you need java, active-X, flash or other evil plugins? Will they exist longer than a few months?

 (DropLoad, ALLPeers and drop.io already have terminated their business)

If you have answered only once "no" to the questions above, then you need F*EX.|||
