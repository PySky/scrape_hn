Last year, we asked young artists across the US to create a doodle about what they see for the future. Congratulations to Sarah Harrison from Connecticut in the 10th-12th grade group on being named the National Finalist of the 2016-17 Doodle 4 Google Contest for her doodle "A Peaceful Future". Google is honored to award Sarah with a $30K college scholarship and a $50K technology award for her school, as well as sharing her doodle on the Google homepage for the world to see.|||
