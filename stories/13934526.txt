The simplest answer to an "is it possible to" question is "yes" or "no". Neither of these answers are really that good, helpful, or useful.

This really is at the crux of the problem with questions of this format.

Assume that the answer is 'yes' and start designing the software. When you have a problem, then ask about that problem.

"But wait!" you say, "This means that I'll need to spend several hours working through this design."

Correct. Asking the community of Programmers.SE to do this design for you may take you less time, but it means that a few people might be working on the question and all spend a few hours of time trying to come up with a solution for you. This is incredibly inefficient use of our time.

The other possibility is that no one answers. And while that isn't as wasteful of the time, it means that you didn't generate any seed for good answers and haven't advanced the situation of trying to find out if something is possible or not.

Asking us to do a feasibility study for you is the same as asking us to come up with the design or write the code. The Stack Exchange Q&A model just isn't set up to provide that. If you really want someone to do a feasibility study for you, there are a number of users who advertise their consultancy in their profile. You may wish to consider contacting one of them.|||
