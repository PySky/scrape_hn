Why use atop? We’re all familiar with top, a real-time system monitor. Some prefer htop and recently I mentioned iotop but for disk read/write monitoring. Today, I wanted to highlight another popular tool for Linux server performance analysis… atop.

Atop is a ASCII full-screen performance monitor which can log and report the activity of all server processes. One feature I really like is that atop will stay active in the background for long-term server analysis (up to 28 days by default). Other advantages include:

Once atop is launched, by default it will show system activity for CPU, memory, swap, disks and network in 10 second intervals. In addition, for each process and thread you can analyse CPU utilization, memory consumption, disk I/O, priority, username, state, and even exit codes.

First install and enable EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repo. See: RedHat solution #308983.

Once installed on any distro, you can launch it similar to top using:

A good place to start would be to read the man pages:

Once atop is running, press the following shortcut keys to sort processes:

By default after install the atop daemon writes snapshots to a compressed log file (eg. /var/log/atop/atop_20140813). These log files can be read using:

Once you open a log file (eg. atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_20140813) then use t to go forward in 10 minute intervals and T to go back. You can analyse specific times by pressing b then entering the time. The above shortcut keys also work in this mode… a, c, d, m,n.

You can use shortcuts with atopsar. For example, using the flag “-c 30 5” with atopsar will generate a report for current CPU utilization for 5 minutes (ten times with intervals of 30 seconds):

But you can limit this to a specific time window using beginning “-b” and end “-e” flags:|||
