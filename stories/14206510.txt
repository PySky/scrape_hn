Your goal is to harvest as many plants as you can before your garden fills up! Manage your garden by placing plants of the same type next to each other, then harvesting them together.

The more plants you harvest at once, the more points you earn, and the more soil you turn over. If your garden fills up before your next chance to harvest, that's game over.

Keep growing and you'll discover new seeds, tall trees, and friendly birds along the way!|||
