PJON_ASK was an early implementation of the PJON Standard, designed to be compatible with noisy and unreliable media like cheap 315/433Mhz ASK/FSK/OOK radio transceivers.

PJON (Padded Jittering Operative Network) is an Arduino compatible, multi-master, multi-media communications bus system. It proposes a Standard and it is designed as a framework for digital communication. It is a valid alternative to i2c, 1-Wire, Serial and other Arduino compatible protocols. If you are interested to know more about the PJON Standard, visit the Wiki. If you need help see the documentation or if something is not working visit the Troubleshooting page.
