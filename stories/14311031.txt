So I am looking for some advice on this. This isn't just another "I have an idea. Code this for me and we'll be rich!". I had an app idea a couple months ago and have been seriously pursuing it since then. I have the name, website domain, business plan, marketing plan, revenue plan, the largest newspaper/digital newspaper in my area ready to do a story on it, have validated the idea with friends and friends of friends, have done market research on the topic, even found the correct API and licensing needed for the app, AND a couple angel investors ready to sit down once I have an MVP created to show. Sorry for all that, I am just trying to explain the extent of the work I have done for this app so you understand this is more than just an idea I have.

My question is: Would I be better off hiring somebody to code the app for me, or search for a cofounder? I have gone through the pros and cons of both, but I would love to have a discussion with you guys and see what YOUR pros, cons, and general thoughts for this is. I am open to ANY feedback and thoughts on this. Thank you!|||
