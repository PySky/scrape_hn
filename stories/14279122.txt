Mobile applications rely upon sophisticated backend services to deliver the application’s functionality to their customers. These services include capabilities such as storage, databases, user management (sign-up, sign-in, identity, resource access control, and security), messaging, and user engagement. Creating the backend services can be a time consuming and error prone endeavor.

With this sample application, AWS Mobile Hub and Ionic have worked together to show how developers creating applications based on the Ionic Framework can quickly and easily leverage AWS Mobile Hub to spin up all of the AWS based backend services required to support the Ionic sample application.

The sample application includes an exported project from AWS Mobile Hub. Developers import the Mobile Hub project in their AWS console, with a drag-and-drop interface, and all of the backend services will automatically be instantiated and provisioned. The cloned project will reproduce the original with a freshly provisioned set of AWS resources. A configuration file for the Ionic application to consume is automatically created for either deployment to device or in a Mobile web scenario.

With the ability to capture and redeploy a stable, known backend, potential for errors and the scope of any debugging/testing are substantially reduced. Ionic developers can focus on the sample application mobile front-end.

For more information, read the blog or see the sample application on GitHub.

AWS Mobile Hub allows you to specify the AWS region where your project’s AWS resources are to be provisioned, and will automatically choose the nearest region if the resource is not available in the specified region. See New Regional Provisioning Capability for more information.|||
