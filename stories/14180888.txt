I’ve been thinking about this thought experiment:

—

 Imagine you’re given two papers.

 Both papers explore the same topic and use the same methodology. Both were preregistered.

 Paper A has a novel study (n1=300) with confirmed hypotheses, followed by two successful direct replications (n2=300, n3=300).

 Paper B has a novel study with confirmed hypotheses (n=900).

 *Intuitively*, which paper would you think has the most evidence? (Be honest, what is your gut reaction?)

I’m reasonably certain the answer is that both papers provide the same amount of evidence, by essentially the likelihood principle, and if anything, one should trust the estimates of paper B more (unless you meta-analyzed paper A, which should give you the same answer as paper B, more or less).

However, my intuition was correct that most people in this group would choose paper A (See https://www.facebook.com/groups/853552931365745/permalink/1343285629059137/ for poll results).

My reasoning is that if you are observing data from the same DGP, then where you cut the data off is arbitrary; why would flipping a coin 10x, 10x, 10x, 10x, 10x provide more evidence than flipping the coin 50x? The method in paper A essentially just collected 300, drew a line, collected 300, drew a line, then collected 300 more, and called them three studies; this has no more information in sum (in a fisherian sense, the information would just add together) than if you didn’t arbitrarily cut the data into sections.

If you read in the comments of this group (which has researchers predominantly of the NHST world), one sees this fallacy that merely by passing a threshold more times means you have more evidence. They use p*p*p to justify it (even though that doesn’t make sense, because one could partition the data into 10 n=90 sets and get ‘more evidence’ by this logic; in fact, you could have 90 p-values of ~.967262 and get a p-value of .05). They use fisher’s method to say the p-value could be low (~.006), even though when combined, the p-value would actually be even lower (~.0007). One employs only Neyman-Pearson logic, and this results in a t1 error probability of .05^3.|||
