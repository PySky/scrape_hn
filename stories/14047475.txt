The simple reason is that charts are usually made up using javascript which doesn't work inside emails. So all you need to do is convert the charts to images and attach them. Unfortunately, there isn't any reliable chart API. Most of the times I just see numbers in emails but not charts.

The process is rather simple. PhantomJS is a headless browser and it renders the html page without a proper browser.

File path or the URL can be used to specify the location to pull html. The html in the example uses Google charts to render a chart. This chart is then converted to an image using chart.getImageURI(); . The base64 generated is stored as img source and the original chart is hidden. Then the html is saved in a separate file (or could have been sent as an email).

The above code explains it exactly. We wait for the ready event which the chart fires once it gets rendered completely. Then it is converted to base64 image and updated as source in img tag.

All you need to do it execute this. It writes a file called test.html which contains the output html with chart image.

It is easy to automate the script by passing params such as,

This will give you reference to the resource id and you can send the email to that resource rather than saving the file. There can be many different ways to automate the whole process.

Sending charts, graphs and statistics in the email itself makes the email more informative. But you seldom find charts inside emails. Images, videos etc. are common but when it comes to charts, you rarely find personalised charts inside emails.|||
