ThinkPhi, founded by Samit and Priya Choksi in 2015, is the Indian company behind the beautiful Ulta Chaata.

On damp days, this collects and filters rainwater for drinking, and in sunshine it generates solar power.

Samit’s tech-savvy (as a software architect and developer) and Priya’s design focus (having worked in architecture and construction), make them quite the power couple.

Their passion is to put green energy into the public eye, for to people to discuss and enjoy together.

“In India, green technology for industrial use is dull and has zero design aspect to it,” Samit Choksi said in one recent interview.

“Companies spend money on green technology, but it is not visible … customers and employees will not climb onto the roof to see the solar panels a company has installed.”|||
