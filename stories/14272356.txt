The company is working on a technology that uses ultrasound to project sensations through the air, directly onto a user’s hand.

The Bristol, England-based haptics technology company Ultrahaptics, has announced that it has raised £17.9 million ($23 million) investment in a Series B round.

The new funding comes from existing shareholders, IP Group plc and Woodford Investment Management, as well as new investors, including Cornes and Dolby Family Ventures.

Ultrahaptics says the additional funding will support the company through its global expansion and its entry into virtual and augmented reality markets.

The company is working on a technology that uses ultrasound to project sensations through the air, directly onto a user’s hand. The technology enables users to ‘feel’ buttons and interact with virtual objects in mid-air, using gestures to interface with technology.

Ultrahaptics is aiming at a variety of different applications in automotive, industrial controls, medical interfaces, and AR and VR environments.

Earlier in 2017, the company announced a collaboration with HARMAN to integrate mid-air haptic sensations into connected cars.|||
