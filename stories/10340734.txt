Enjoy a PC-like experience that’s powered by your phone. And while you’re working on an external monitor, you can still use your Lumia 950 or 950 XL like you would normally – answer phone calls and send text messages without interrupting what’s on the big screen. Maximize your productivity with the advantages of a bigger screen and keep using your phone at the same time.|||

Expand your smartphone experience. Connect your Lumia 950 or 950 XL to a Microsoft display dock and go further with an external monitor and keyboard.
