For months, we’ve all watched the steady unfolding of a humanitarian crisis. Waves of refugees, driven from their homes by violence and war, have given up everything to escape. They’ve crossed nations on foot and open water in cramped, unsafe boats, just to reach someplace — anyplace — safe. UNHCR’s job is to help them survive and recover: to provide aid and shelter, reunite families, and support people as they struggle to build new lives.

This year alone, half a million refugees have found their way to Europe. Many of them arrive exhausted, malnourished, and carrying the few possessions they could save. Six thousand more are arriving in Greece each day. Globally, more than half of the refugee population is under 18. Often, children end up separated from their loved ones, lost in strange new places.

UNHCR is helping, in Europe and around the globe. And you can help them. At the invitation of the White House, we’re joining the effort to support their important work. Any money you give through this campaign will go directly to USA for UNHCR to provide aid to people who need it — everything from food, water, and warm clothes to special care for children separated from their families.

Look above to see what your support could provide to people in need, from the most basic necessities to the tools to keep communities together. This is a complex and evolving crisis, and there are no overnight solutions. But even a small contribution can give a family a place to sleep, or a child a set of dry clothes — and to them, that helps a lot.
