UPDATE TO PURPLE'S RESPONSE - PLEASE SEE HERE - https://www.honestmattressreviews.com...



Please don't let MY mistake detract you from the major Safety Concern of Purple's Use Of A Microscopic plastic powder that can be inhaled. That is Purple's true intent - to detract the issue at hand.



HONEST MATTRESS REVIEWS RESPONSE 



First and foremost, I'm sorry my action caused you to feel mislead. I included in my disclosure since official launch that I have consulted with many companies. After reading everyone's comments I do want to clear the air. REGARDLESS, I understand your point and am updating the YouTube video to ENSURE everyone knows I've consulted for many companies in this space. 



Please read my admitting misrepresentation by self-assigning a job title. I self-admittedly created my own fake job title (I disclosed this immediately to Purple in the sworn affidavit to the court). As you see below the original title then I created my own for this event. It was a mistake in retrospect as it wasn’t fair to that mattress company that I took it on my own behalf to misrepresent myself that way. It was at this time I put it on my LinkedIn & Twitter. The company the asked me to remove that as it simply wasn’t true. I then compiled immediately. https://www.honestmattressreviews.com...



In all honesty, I, personally am 100% wrong for that. There is no other way to put it.



Also, please read how Purple knew of my consulting with many companies and yet still had a great relationship with Honest Mattress Reviews. In fact, you will see the emails and tweets back and forth between Purple and me.

I truly have loved Purple's innovative storytelling/infomercial style marketing. As I am a marketer myself, I've always been a huge fan. In fact, I'm still a huge fan or their marketing. But, when I inquired with them about the powder they went radio silent. I have over 450+ articles on my website covering all brands. Look in the news section of my site.
