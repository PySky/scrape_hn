Hi,

 

 I am happy to announce that GNU APL 1.7 has been released.

 

 GNU APL is a free implementation of the ISO standard 13751 aka.

 "Programming Language APL, Extended",

 

 This release contains:

 

 * bug fixes,

 

 * ⎕SQL (replaces the SQL native function),

 

 * ⎕DLX (an implementation of Donald Knuth's dancing links

   algorithm, aka. Algorithm X or DLX).

 

 * an interface from the programming languages Erlang and Elixir

   into GNU APL. With this interface one can use APL's vector

   capabilities in programs written in Erlang or Elixir. Or from

   the Phoenix web framework.

 

 All bugs reported before Mar. 17, 2017 were fixed.

 

 The GNU APL project lives at: http://www.gnu.org/software/apl

 and can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/apl/ or any

 GNU mirror.

 

 Bug reports and other suggestions are welcome at address@hidden.

 

 Have fun!

 

 Dr. Jürgen Sauermann

 Author and Maintainer of GNU APL
