When hiring Node developers, far too many product companies target a narrow skill set that directly corresponds to their project. But is this a wise approach? Well, it sure makes things easier for your candidates…

The dev crew at DedicatedTeams has several Node.js professionals onboard. They’ve gone through dozens of Node.js interviews — both as candidates and as interviewers — and they have a ton of experience to share.

For this post, I’ve asked our Node guys to provide me with a comprehensive list of skills they look at when interviewing Node.js developers for hire. For the sake of clarity, I’ll divide the list into three categories: must-haves, nice-to-haves, and advanced.

Let’s start with the things you’d pretty much expect from every hirable Node.js developer. I’m sure you’ll find several points obvious (especially the first one), but hey, some things need to be mentioned for the sake of order 🤓. Without further ado, here are the must-haves:

See the list below and you’ll notice that the “nice-to-have” section includes quite a few competencies that many would find essential.

Still, lack of some of these skills shouldn’t serve as a red flag for interviewers. Most of the skills listed below can be picked up by any hirable Node.js developer within weeks. As for those that take longer, they’re not that crucial.

Skills falling into this category are characteristic of experienced team leads and/or full-stack JavaScript developers with solid knowledge of Node. Basically, you’d want to consider the points from the list below when choosing between two equally great specialists.

Have you ever had this nagging feeling as if you’re forgetting something? I guess, trying to make a comprehensive list of anything always leaves you with a feeling of this sort…

So is there anything else I should’ve included into this list? Maybe, there are other skills that you target when interviewing Node.js developers for hire? In case you’d like to see a particular skill added to this list, leave a comment!|||
