Comparing most retailers’ mobile conversion rate vs desktop is a bit of a shock. In many cases mobile conversion rates are roughly half that of desktop users. Should you be worried about that? With mobile now the dominant channel for shopping, the answer is an obvious yes.

So why are mobile users failing to convert in the way desktop shoppers do?

Over the last few month we conducted our largest ever research project – in an effort to answer this question. It turns out at least part of the answer is pretty straight forward.

Naturally with several months research in the bag, we have a mountain of insights and, importantly, solutions to help you tackle the issues affecting mobile conversion rates.
