Apple is currently in the process of rolling out iOS 10.3, with the biggest new feature reserved for AirPods owners. You can now track the location of Apple’s wireless earbuds in the Find My iPhone app, either by playing a sound from one or both misplaced AirPods, or seeing the location where the earbuds were last connected to your iOS device over Bluetooth.

There’s some other user-facing stuff as well: developers can now publicly respond to reviews in the App Store, and you can label reviews from other people as helpful (or not so helpful). Watching rented movies across your various devices gets much easier as of this update, too.

The other big change in iOS 10.3 is a significant changeover to a new file system: the Apple File System. First introduced at WWDC 2016, Apple describes AFS as “the next generation in storage.” Once you’ve installed the update on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, AFS will replace the existing HFS+ file system. You, the user, probably won’t notice much — except for maybe a slight increase in available storage space. But overall, AFS is better for encryption, scaling across devices, and optimized for SSDs.

Separately, Apple also launched mac OS Sierra 10.12.4. There, the big new thing is Night Shift on the desktop, which reduces blue light in the display to help you sleep better if you’re on your MacBook before bed — and you believe the science on this stuff.

Oh, and the Apple Watch is also being updated with a Theater Mode today. If you’ve got any nerdy tidbits included in any of these updates that you like, please do share.|||
