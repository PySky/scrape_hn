Joseph Mancuso‘s  “How to Start, Finance, and Manage Your Own Small Business” contains an “Entrepreneur’s Quiz” a self-assessment for entrepreneurs. His explanation for the reasons behind some of the questions includes the following nuggets:

This is not so much a matter of choice as of personality–although upbringing is certainly as large a factor.

It’s an accident of birth but an entrepreneurial parent (or close relative) is a reliable marker for a sustained and informed motivation toward entrepreneurship. Of course it can work the other way as well. I remember when my younger son came to me when he was 12 and told me in an excited voice: “Papa, you are your own boss!” As the years have gone by he finds the idea much less exciting.

Sales people focus on meeting quota, entrepreneurs need to meet payroll. I find a desire for autonomy and achievement to be more reliable indicators of an entrepreneurial inclination than a focus on wealth.

It’s not about the gambling, it’s find opportunities for particular skills and insights, coupled with hard work and attention to detail can make a significant difference.

You have to see the future to create it but it’s more about exploring and then blazing a trail than seeing the complete path at the outset.|||
