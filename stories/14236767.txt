If the management of your site looks mountain, if you want to be sure of its safety, if all you want is to just check with your mouse, then you are on the right page!

 Plesk Controlpanel is your tool!

It only works under the environment SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) with maximum security 128bit encoding. With full manual (manual) for all (administrator, reseller, owner vserver, mail user) makes it a pice of cake to navigate, even for the most inexperienced user. It provides 4 independent access levels, Server administrator (on their dedicated servers), reseller (on the shared hosting), owner of the vserver (for the web hosting) and email user. Bringing together a number of options makes the access to it, "a pice of cake", 24 hours a day without the slightest interruption, whether your site is hosted on one of our Windows or Linux Servers and regardless of whether they are served in Greek or international Backbone. The commands are run in real time, ie immediately, just when you press the last "click" without delay and uncertainty!|||
