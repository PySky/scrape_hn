I am exceptionally pleased and excited to share this short work update. We have finalised and are currently testing dSPP — the first protein machine learning database. Our resource, currently under peer-review, will facilitate the access to machine learning ready protein data for 7000+ high value medical targets, including protein involved in Zika virus, HIV, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, p53 mutants, human prion proteins, and many others.

We are beta-testing user interface and UX. I attach an example for Zika virus NS3 protease fragment search. Please note the Machine learning section, and various interactive data representations for Keras and Google’s Tensorflow.
