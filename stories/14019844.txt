This month World Book Club visits the Oxford Literary Festival in the elegant surroundings of Worcester College, part of the university and is talking to the hugely popular British author Robert Harris with an audience about the first of his bestselling Roman trilogy, Imperium.

The setting is Ancient Rome, a city teeming with ambitious and ruthless men, but none more brilliant than a rising young lawyer Marcus Cicero who decides to gamble all on one of the most dramatic courtroom battles of all time. Scrupulously researched and vividly imagined Imperium brings to life the cutthroat politics and the timeless pursuit of power as one man seeks to attain supreme authority within the state.|||
