One of the strengths of the web is progressive loading, which means that there is no install step and users can start consuming content almost immediately while the site keeps loading. But progressive loading can also result in annoyances, such as an unexpected page jump when offscreen content loads and pushes down whatâ€™s currently on the screen. This can be even worse on mobile devices, since smaller screens mean more content is offscreen and page jumps are more likely. 



Since its early days, Chrome has taken a stand against bad or abusive content. For instance, warns users before they visit malicious websites, and allow our users to quickly track down the source of unexpected noise. Similar to other features designed to protect our users from bad experiences, starting in version 56 Chrome prevents these unexpected page jumps with a new feature called scroll anchoring. This feature works by locking the scroll position on an on-screen element to keep our users in the same spot even as offscreen content continues to load.|||
