TiddlyMap is a TiddlyWiki plugin that turns your favourite personal note taking software in a wiki-concept-map hybrid. Yes, you will be able to do both: drawing maps and putting down knowledge in a wiki way. TiddlyMap will allow you to visually link and create wiki topics in order to create clickable graphs, e.g. concept maps or dependency graphs. Moreover it will automatically visualize your topic structures so you get an immediate grasp of topics and relations.

A demo with several examples and explanations can be found at the project's website tiddlymap.org. While TiddlyMap also works with mobile devices, it is written for larger screens (>= 1440px width), since concept mapping requires space.

The motivation behind TiddlyMap is to combine the strengths of wikis and concept maps in the realms of personal knowledge management in a single application.

Have you ever created mind- or concept maps and later wished you could turn them into a wiki because they became too complex and too hard to maintain? On the contrary, have you ever worked with a wiki and felt that it is lacking visual means to express your thoughts and to relate your content? – If yes, then TiddlyMap is certainly what you are looking for.

TiddlyMap is based on two popular open-source projects.

TiddlyWiki, a personal wiki software developed by Jeremy Ruston, is used as runtime environment. TiddlyWiki is a unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information. It is a highly interactive application that is stored in a single file.

Vis.js is used for graph visualization and manipulation. Vis.js is a dynamic, browser based visualization library actively developed and maintained by a team of great developers working at Almende B.V.

TiddlyMap is distributed under the BSD 2-Clause License. By using this plugin you agree to the product's License Terms.

There are two ways to install TiddlyMap and TiddlyWiki. If you are a beginner or not a techie person, you should probably go with the standalone installation.

This is the most simply and common method, especially when using TiddlyWiki in standalone. You can also use this method when TiddlyWiki is run under Node.js. Please follow the instructions given here. Maybe this introductory video also helps.

Option 2 – Include the plugin in the TiddlyWiki plugin-folder

This method requires you to have TiddlyWiki running as server using Node.js. For general information on how to set up TiddlyWiki5 with Node.js visit tiddlywiki.com. Installing TiddlyMap this way has the benefit that the same TiddlyMap plugin can be included in several wikis served by Node.js.

Now in every wiki you want TiddlyMap to appear in, you need to update the plugin section of your wiki's file, which resides in the root of your wiki, to contain the following:

Make sure your file is correctly formated and contains valid JSON and always remember to restart your tiddlywiki server to reflect the changes.

If you want to compile your own TiddlyMap plugin from souce, follow the steps below.

Note: In case you want to contribute code to the project, make sure you read Contributing to TiddlyMap and signed the CLA before creating a pull request.

First, make sure you have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. Now, start a terminal and clone the repository using the command below. This may take a while, so relax or make yourself a tea…

Open the root directory of the just cloned repository…

…and execute the command below. Again, this may take a minute or two. So instead of looking at the screen, maybe do some exercises in between (please notice the rhyme here, it took me a while to develop it).

Now use one of the following commands:

The build produces a few folders, i.e. , , , in the local repository's root. To test the compiled plugin, follow the installation instructions given in the previous section.|||
