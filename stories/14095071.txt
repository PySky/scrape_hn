Less than 2 months ago, one of my websites got hacked, hackers were injecting porn links as a none display HTML division code block into my HTML code. I have been trying to figure out who doing this for sometimes. I have suspicion over two groups of people that could involve or know these hackers but I am not certain, because, it is not solid evidence but just circumstantial. Now, I am following the hacker trails for days and found these websites that got hacked.

This list is now dedicated as a listing of only governmental and educational websites that are currently being hacked. For the list of none governmental and educational websites that are currently being hacked, please refer to my other list at http://kevinhng86.iblog.website/2017/04/16/hacked-website-list-of-none-govermental-and-none-educational-website/ . The only section in this list that contained none governmental or educational sites is the section of websites that I contacted and some small exceptions. Some of these sites are not in English, therefore, I am asking for help from people who speak these site language to contact them. Anytime a website is being listed on to this list, at the time of listing, the website was still being hacked. If its come to my attention that any website on this list is fixed, I will put the word fixed next to the website name.

From all the web addresses below, if you go onto the website using a browser, then view the source code of the page. Within the source code, search for the word . In most browser, when viewing the source code of a webpage, you can just press to search for a phrase or word in the source code. There will be some link that links to porn sites that would be hidden from the browser rendering engine by having the 0 font size, out of area display or with hidden HTML attribute. This is really hard to track in the beginning because first I thought site owner trying to sell PageRank, then it is obvious when it’s come to education and government sites.

After I got hacked, I reinstall everything but keep the old data as a backup on my office computer for evidence. If you are a government official or have the authority for investigation and if you need the information, please contact me and obtain the data for investigation.

The following are sites that got hacked and I divide them into two categories. The one that I contacted and the one that I couldn’t contact. You can check them both out. For the one that I contacted, you could also try to contact them if they didn’t fix the problem. Some of the sites I contacted was not in English but I gave English a try. Last I checked they still didn’t fix it. If I found any more site that hacked I will update this page.

Check out the website that I contacted. Even the government website of Lebanon got hacked and they still not fix it at this time of writing and I did contact them.

*** This list is live and may update from time to time. If a website on this list become clean and you know please e-mail me at admin@iblog.website, thank you. ***

*** If your website is on this list, you can ask me to remove your web address from this list, one it is fixed, please use your e-mail @ your domain to contact me at admin@iblog.website ***

Note: This list had become too big, I will not be adding more website to this list, but will only update the hacked websites’ status when I know that the hacked website is fixed. In a month from now, I will launch a platform that will mainly be use as a service for listing and report currenly hacked website. Nevertheless, I will program the platform and not using anyone else premade platform. Thus, will take sometimes. Nevertheless, thank you for the support of reading this list and helping me contact the website owners.
