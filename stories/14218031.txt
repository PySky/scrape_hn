NOTE: This is an incomplete project. Expect bugs! I may decide to spend a lot more time on it if people persist giving it positive attention.

A flexible artificial neural network builder for, to analysis performance, and optimise the best model.

Perceptron is a software that will help researchers, students, and programmers to design, compare, and test artificial neural networks. As it stands, there are few visual tools that do this for free, and with simplicity. This software is largely for educational purposes, allowing people to experiment and understand how the different attributes within an ANN can result in different performances and better results. I have not used libraries like TensorFlow specifally so people can see what goes on lower level, all within the code.|||
