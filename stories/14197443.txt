With the release of Windows 10, we simplified the servicing process by moving to cumulative updates, where each update released contains all the new fixes for that month, as well as all the older fixes from previous months. Today, most organizations deploy these cumulative updates when they are released on the second Tuesday of every month, also called “Update Tuesday.” Because these updates contain new security fixes, they are considered “Security Updates” in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and System Center Configuration Manager.

Based on feedback from customers, we are making some adjustments to the updates that we are releasing for Windows 10, version 1703 (also known as the “Creators Update”). With these changes, we will routinely offer one (or sometimes more than one) additional update each month. These additional cumulative updates will contain only new non-security updates, so they will be considered “Updates” in WSUS and Configuration Manager.

Note that we may occasionally identify non-security fixes that address more critical issues that could be affecting organizations. In those rare cases, a cumulative update would be considered as “Critical Updates” in WSUS and Configuration Manager.

For those using Windows Update for Business, these new “Updates” and “Critical Updates” will not be installed on any devices that have been configured with Windows Update for Business policies.

Organizations have the flexibility to choose what to do with these new non-security cumulative updates:

We believe these additional cumulative updates, and the increased flexibility that they provide to organizations, will be beneficial to organizations of all types. As always, please continue to provide feedback on other ways that we can continue to improve the Windows 10 servicing process.|||
