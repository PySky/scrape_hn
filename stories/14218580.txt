With WordPress and WooCommerce, creating a simple online store has never been easier. You can prepare everything in just a few days, and the good thing is that you don't have to know much about the platform. Still, creating a good online store that your customers will happily visit requires more effort from you. You will have to design your store, add all the necessary features and entice visitors to become customers.

Luckily, some professional developers work for you. In this case, folks at Codestag have published a new WordPress online store theme that's compatible with WooComerce and other popular plugins that you'll need for your new online shop.

Premium WordPress themes keep on getting better. Developers have started to listen what regular WP users really need, and here we have the latest proof. Atik is described as a simple WordPress online store theme, and that's exactly what you can expect from it – in a very good way.

From the moment you install Atik to customizing your WordPress online store, there won't be more than five to ten minutes (depending on how much experience with WordPress you already have). Things are really as simple as possible, yet the theme offers everything you'll want from an online shop. Stick with us for this review, and we'll show you why to choose Atik as your new WordPress online store theme.

The first thing you will want to do is to create a new page. This page will be your front page that will contain sections and widgets. As you will see from the detailed documentation, creating the homepage takes just a few clicks. And if you have some experience with WordPress, you'll create one even faster (hint: you just need to select the right template)

After the initial setup, you can personalize the entire front page from the Customization screen. The developers have prepared several sections that will make your visitors love the homepage from the first sight:

In addition to these theme-specific widgets, you can add any widget you have on your WordPress site. That means that you can quickly add Google Maps Widget, contact forms, favorite posts or anything else you like.

The developers did some extra work to make things as simple as possible. So, instead of wandering through WordPress, you can find practically all options in the Customizer. There you will find options to change info about your site, colors, fonts, header media, background images, menus, content, widgets…

Although Atik doesn't require you to add plugins, you will need to install WooCommerce if you want your online store to work properly. Don't worry; Atik is designed with WooCommerce in mind, so everything will work perfectly for you. As everything is beginner friendly, don't worry if this is your first time with WooCommerce.

After installing WooCommerce, you can quickly start adding new products and showing them on your homepage. Just like with posts, you get to organize your products into categories and subcategories. Change the way your products will be displayed, add thumbnail images and personalize the product pages until you create a perfect online store for your business.

Although you can use the theme without any additional installations, there a few plugins that can help you extend the already powerful WordPress online store theme. For starters, there's StagTools, a plugin that will add a few extra widgets and shortcodes that will simplify the site building process.

WooCommerce will take care of the online commerce functionality.  It's free and fully compatible with the theme so you should install it the very moment you get Atik.

LayerSlider is a premium plugin that comes packed with the theme. With it, you will be able to show gorgeous slides on your homepage that will make your online store both visually appealing and more functional.

Even though the entire theme is created with simplicity in mind, not all users have been working with WordPress before. So, for those who are just starting, the developers of Atik created a very detailed documentation file which will guide you through the entire setup process. If there's something you can't accomplish, the documentation will solve the problem for you.

If you're still not familiar with Codestag, you should note that this elite developer has been on Envato for more than four years. There are a dozen themes in their portfolio with more than 12,000 sold items! So, if anything is not clear enough, you can rely on the great support who will help you with anything you need.

After spending some time with this fantastic WordPress online store theme, you will get a clean and functional shop that you and your customers will love. If you're still not sure if Atik is the theme for you, we suggest that you take a look at the demo site. Once you see how elegant that demo store looks like, you'll be already on your way to install Atik. Yes, it's that amazing.|||
