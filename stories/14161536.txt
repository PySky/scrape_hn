This project is heavily inspired by json-server, written with rust.

Our first aim is to generate a fake api from the given data source (JSON). It may have bugs, missing features but if you contribute they all will be fixed.

Executable can take configuration path otherwise it will use default . If we take project folder as root, commands should look like one of these. If you you use version change with .

Configuration file is a very simple json file which is responsible to hold server and database properties.

Here the and are tables. They can be empty arrays/objects but they must exist as is.

NOTE : : Column is a must, all parsing uses it.

Api usage is pretty simple. For now it does not support filters one other query params. Here is the list of the calls you can make with examples.

Give the API consumer the ability to choose returned fields. This will also reduce the network traffic and speed up the usage of the API.
