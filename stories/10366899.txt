ZimCode.IO is an importer library to make handling files easy.

ZimCode.IO is avaliable on NuGet or through the package manager console

For an example on how to create your own importer take a look at the implementation of the XmlImporter and XmlLoader classes.

Operations are used internaly to pass params between loading operations and handle exceptions for you, providing you with a simple async method that can be awaited, and if any exceptions occur, are avaliable through the ProgressReporter class.

You can also chain Operations for an automatic progress report.

< > () { // Load the XDocument. The XDocument returned from the OpenDocument // method will be passed to the next operation if it is a Consume or // ConsumeGenerate. Here we use ConsumeGenerate because we need a // result as the last operation in a loader. Operation.Generate<XDocument>( ); // Here we consume the XDocument that was loaded from the previous // operation and add a new first element to it. Operation.ConsumeGenerate<XDocument, XDocument>(d => { d.AddFirst( ( )); d; }); }|||
