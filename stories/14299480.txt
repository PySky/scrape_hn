NB: The files under C:/windows/scripts are legit. They are used by the local IT team which does some administration task using Windows Scripting Host.

The suspected files are highlighted in red. The IT analyst suspect them due to their extension and their names (facture is billing in french). The fact that all the executions are done on the same machine using the same account in a short time range seems to prove a relation between the files. The real script seems to be facture.js (It is the only file executed on the 22 and the 28 of March). The IT analyst suspect that this file is fetched from an USB device. The workstation was infected at least 2 times (on the 22 of March and on the 28 of March).|||
