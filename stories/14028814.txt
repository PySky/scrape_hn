Formbot costs $9 per month for unlimited form submissions across unlimited sites.

Formbot has built-in spam prevention. Simply include the script tag at the bottom of your page, and Formbot will employ the Honeypot technique against your form.

I'm Teejay VanSlyke, a developer in Eugene, Oregon. I love using static site generators like Jekyll and Middleman, but found myself out of options as soon as I wanted to add a form. I built Formbot specifically for adding a contact form to my own site, and hope your sites will benefit, too!
