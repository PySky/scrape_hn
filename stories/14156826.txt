Thereâ€™s been a load of hints about something new coming to the MacStories family for a while, and itâ€™s finally been announced. Itâ€™s called AppStories!

AppStories is a new podcast by Federico Viticci and John Voorhees, which focusses on apps, notable updates, and also the stories behind them.

I actually listened to the first episode a day early, due to me doing a bit of preemptive searching on Overcast, and actually finding out the secret project before it was announced!

From the first episode, I can tell that itâ€™s going to be a podcast for me. With Connected currently being my absolute must-listen show, AppStories is going to be joining it. Iâ€™m super interested in apps, as you can probably see by my writing here, and also from the fact that I am also an app developer.

Hopefully this new podcast can lead me to more of the great apps, that are constantly being released on Apple platforms. And I can also see it being beneficial from a developer perspective, as AppStories will also be featuring interviews with developers, which for me sounds amazing! It's not often I get to hear how other developers work, so that's one segment I'm looking forward to.

However, if youâ€™re still thinking that this big announcement was a new podcast, youâ€™re only half correct. Because the podcast also has itâ€™s own website, that has been custom built to allow for the best podcast experience. Which is evident when you see the custom audio player, that can also be embedded rather easily. I have embedded the first podcast below, so if itâ€™s enabled on your browser, youâ€™ll be able to see it.

I've also been told that, in true MacStories fashion, the website has it's own API, and therefore there is a lot of automation happening. Which isn't really a surprise!

You can find more information about the AppStories podcast, the first episode, and also links to subscribe on the many podcast apps, directly on the AppStories website. And in usual fashion, Federico has written an introduction article, "Introducing AppStories", which details how the idea has finally come to fruition. It's been around for a lot longer than you may think!

AppStories will be a weekly show, lasting around 30 mins each, and will be published on Mondays, starting on the 24th April. Except of course this first episode, which was released as part of MacStories 8th birthday celebrations! ðŸŽ‰|||
