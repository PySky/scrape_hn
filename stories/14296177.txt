Wohoo, whilst taking a look over the logs today, although I have no LoRa nodes myself, I noticed that my Single Channel LoRa Gateway had received it’s first packet from somebody and here it is…

Proof it works atleast, of course we do not know what the data contains as it is encrypted with another The Things Network user’s application key but atleast somebody nearby is getting heard by my gateway and hopefully their packets are getting forwarded on to their application via The Things Network. Oh well, hopefully only another couple of weeks before my LoRa transceiver shipment from China arrives so we can start converting my current ESP8266 based sensors into LoRa equivalents, then we can see the end to end process.
