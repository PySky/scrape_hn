Over the next week or two, we are hoping to roll out some new features. Among these are undo/redo, the ability to hide the consensus, and a cool feature called auto-depth. Auto-depth will occur automatically when a player places a node in Connect-the-Dots mode. It will search a few of the surrounding layers and ensure the node is placed on the layer where the neuronal signal is the brightest. This should help ensure precision placement and increased accuracy. 



 What features are most important to you? Is there a feature listed above that you are excited to see implemented? Are there other features or tools you think would make Mozak better? Pop over to the forum thread and have your voice be heard!
