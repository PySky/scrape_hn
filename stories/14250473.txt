I have a web robot which is a Java app.  I need to be able to set theUser-Agent field in the HTTP header in order to be a good net citizen (sopeople know who is accessing their server).  Anyone have any ideas?

Right now, Java sends a request that includes something like:

I'd rather not rewrite all the HTTP stuff myself.  I tried just searching

in the JDK for the Java/1.0beta2 figuring I could just change the string,

but I couldn't find it. Perhaps it is stored as a unicode string?

An easy method of setting the User-Agent field should probably be added to

Java, so people can properly identify their programs.|||
