What it is: Trello is a board and card-based (Kanban-style) app, developed by Fog Creek Software to simplify managing projects and tasks.

Why it works for remote devs and designers: Trello is accessible on the go, from any browser or device. Its visual layout makes it easy to see and organize your workflow at a glance. It’s also easy to invite clients or teammates to join a board, see the progress of a project, and leave their own contributions or comments. Changes sync in real time so everyone’s always on the same page.

What it is: Sketchboard is an endless virtual whiteboard for interactive sketching and brainstorming. This tool was created by a software developer frustrated by the lack of interactivity in collaborating with teammates spread across different locations.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

When working with a remote team, it can be hard to replicate the process of bouncing ideas off each other in person. Sketchboard is meant to recreate the experience of gathering around a whiteboard and doing some visual brainstorming — except teammates don’t have to be in the same room to collaborate.

What it is: Zeplin isa platform for coordinating design handoffs, so web and app designers and developers are on the same page. Projects can be uploaded into Zeplin, where individuals or teams can work together to finalize designs and prepare them for production.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

Designers and developers often come from different perspectives and sometimes have trouble communicating, which can be magnified without vital face-to-face time. Zeplin is designed to fill in the gaps between the two disciplines and help make collaboration seamless and location-independent

What it is: InVision is a prototyping platform for design-driven product development featuring real-time, in-browser collaboration, presentation, and testing tools.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

For remote workers, the easier it is to connect with teammates or clients online, the better. InVision lives in your browser and is designed to be a comprehensive prototyping solution that merges many design and development tasks and processes into one feature-rich platform, while making collaboration easier.

Chances are you’re familiar with Slack, the business messaging app that many remote teams rely on as their “virtual office.” But did you know that Slack has a directory of other apps you can add on and use within the platform? We picked out a few of the most helpful options for creatives working remotely.

What it is: Spacetime is a tool that helps teams coordinate across time zones, providing an easy way to view and compare teammates’ local times and working hours.

Spacetime has a web interface that you can invite teammates to use, as well as a Slack bot that converts times based on the location of the user mentioned — a handy tool for planning meetings across time zones. Here’s an example:

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

If you’re working remotely, it’s likely that you’re regularly collaborating with people in different time zones and have gone through the process of trying to calculate time differences. Add multiple teammates to the mix, and things can get confusing. Having a solution in place can save some time, hassle, and mental acrobatics.

What it is: Screenhero is a collaborative screensharing tool with voice chat and multiple mouse cursors. Screenhero was created specifically as a solution for remote workers that enables interaction (not just presentations or screencasting).

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

Screenhero has features created specifically for both designers and developers. Developers can code with a teammate or mentor in their favorite IDE, making pair programming or debugging simple. Designers can iterate faster by reviewing designs with stakeholders or clients in real time — no passing files back and forth.

What it is: Type Anything is a tool for creating and testing typeface combinations that automatically generates code to copy into your web projects.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

Typography can make or break a design or user experience. When you’re working remotely—on your own and often without feedback—and you’re deep in the throes of a project, sometimes you make quick decisions that may not pan out too well a few days later when you’re looking at your work with fresh eyes. Type Anything helps you avoid making typography choices you’ll regret later with a framework for proactively exploring and testing font combinations before plugging them into your design.

What it is: Frontify is a tool for creating style or brand guides that you can keep, update, and share online. You can explore Frontify’s own style guide as an example.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

When you’re working with people in different locations, whether teammates or clients, it’s important that everyone has easy access to important information, like brand guidelines or design best practices. Frontify is a great option for storing visual or branding guidelines and assets. It’s also a helpful tool to give clients as an extra resource, along with the final design handover.

What it is: Focusmusic.fm is described as “beats for work, productivity, and flow.” This website provides a variety of music (mostly lyrics-free) to help you concentrate, and it features a simple interface that lets you quickly select some music and get back to work.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

Whether you’re working at home or in a public place, sometimes you just need a little background noise to get in your workflow. Focusmusic.fm can do the trick, and is also great for drowning out distracting sounds in your work environment.

What it is: Noisli is for those who find actual music distracting while they work. It lets you create your own mix of ambient and nature sounds, or choose from pre-made mixes.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

Studies have shown that ambient noise can boost productivity and creativity. If you have trouble focusing in complete silence, or you get distracted when you’re working from home alone, Noisli is worth a try.

What it is: Ghost Browser is a multi-session browser that lets you log into any website using multiple accounts at the same time, and in the same window. Ghost Browser is built on Chromium, and offers a similar browsing experience to Google Chrome.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

When you work remotely, you spend all day online, and have a lot going on. With projects coming at you from multiple clients or stakeholders, you may be working in more than one browser, with multiple user or admin accounts — as the tabs pile up, things can get messy.

Since the Internet is your office, you need a tool that helps you get things done online. Ghost Browser is designed to simplify your browsing experience, keep you organized, and boost your productivity.

What it is: Freeter is an app for managing all your work and to-do lists from one place.

Why it works for remote devs and designers:

Remote workers depend on a lot of apps and tools for work and collaboration. Sometimes we don’t realize how much time we waste opening and closing apps and websites, or shifting back and forth between tasks; often we lose track of what we were doing in the process.

Freeter was created by a freelance developer who had the same problem; he found himself constantly disorganized and distracted by task-switching. So he developed Freeter to be a hub for all his work and to simplify juggling multiple projects at once.
