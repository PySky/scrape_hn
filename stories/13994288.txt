The bond between mum and baby during breastfeeding is incredible. But there’s nothing rose-tinted about waking, sleep-deprived, for the 3am feed with a head full of worry.

Because life for new mums is new, women often feel anxious about whether they’re ‘doing it right’; that’s why the NHS just launched a 24-hour chatbot – to gives mums additional support.

The thing is, the NHS Breastfeeding Friend isn’t really your friend: it won’t understand you, it can’t help you, and will likely leave you feeling more stressed and confused.

When we tested the ‘Start4Life Breastfeeding Friend‘ chatbot (which you can test yourself using Facebook Messenger), we found it to be utterly clueless.

While the robot appears to be able to understand some subject cues, it simply doesn’t understand human speech.|||

Breastfeeding? Sadly, this bot can't help.
