Design is a somewhat diluted term in the software industry so I'll go with Rich Hickey's definition - which is, I paraphrase here - the art of breaking down a problem such that it can be composed back. Essentially, your implementation must contain tiny modules each of which do one thing. This, will help writing "evident code" that is "obviously correct; instead of, without obvious mistakes"[0]. The type system of the language per se does not help or come in the way of design.|||
