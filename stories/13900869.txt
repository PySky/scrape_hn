Here’s something I think you’ll find quite interesting… These crazy images were created by French artist Jean-Marc Cote, and a few others back in 1899, 1900, 1901, and 1910.

The point being.. Well, basically they were asked to imagine what life would be like in the year 2000.

According to Collective-Evolution, these artworks were originally in the form of postcards or paper cards enclosed in cigarette boxes.

The images depict the world as it was imagined it would be like in the year 2000. Now we haven’t started riding giant seahorses yet, although it does look like one hell of a good time.

We should do this again and imagine what life will be like 100 years from now.|||
