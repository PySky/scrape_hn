MUMBAI: This week,moved a step closer to reality with Isro inviting proposals for space-based experiments from scientists across the country.According to Isro, the payload capability of the Venus-bound satellite is expected to be 175 kg with 500W of power. The orbit will be 500 X 60,000km around Venus, which will gradually reduce over several months.The focus of the mission will be atmospheric and surface studies, Sun-Venus interaction , biology experiments and technology demonstration. An Isro official told TOI that though it is an approved mission, the date of the launch is yet to be firmed up. Thehas been listed as part of the department of space's demand for grants.Explaining the importance of this flight, Isro said that Venus is described as the twin sister of the earth because of the similarities in size, mass, density, bulk composition and gravity. "It is believed that both planets were formed at the same time around 4.5 billion years ago," Isro stated.According to Isro, the exploration of Venus began in the early 1960s with fly by and lander missions and atmospheric probes."In spite of great progress made in exploring Venus, there still exist gaps in our understanding about surface, sub-surface features and processes, and super rotation of the Venusian atmosphere , its evolution and interaction with solar radiation solar wind," Isro stated.|||
