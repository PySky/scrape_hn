CloudMosa's mission is to improve web experience on mobile devices with cloud computing. To most web users, speed is everything. Unfortunately, many mobile devices are slow due to cost, size and weight constraints. CloudMosa has developed technology that shifts the workload from mobile devices to cloud servers. Resource-demanding web applications can run smoothly on resource-limited devices by running compute-intensive tasks in the cloud.|||
