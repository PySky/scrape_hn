ls is a two letter command both Unix users and sysadmins cannot live without. Whether you use it 1 time a day or 1000 times a day, knowing the power of the ls command can make your command line journey more enjoyable.

ls is basically a command used to have a look at the list of files and folders in the present directory. But, you can do a lot more than a list of files with this command. Let’s explore a few of them.

The -1 is used at the end to show single entry per line.

To show complete information about files, use -l at the end.

The ls –lh (where h stands for human readable format) is used to see the size of folders in MB, KB etc.

You can sort the list of files in the order of modification in time.

In the place of lt, type ltr.

If you want to print question mark instead of the non-graphics control characters use the -q option.

This opens the “first long file”, as it is the last edited one.

Lists the output like -l, but shows the uid and gid in numeric format instead of names.|||
