Mary Beth Brown started working for Elon soon after we moved to LA twelve or thirteen years ago (Elon and I were still married then).  MB was an exceptional and devoted employee of Elon's and lovely to deal with on a personal level. She gave her life to the job -- and to our family -- and the news of her departure was a shock to me. 



Apparently (according, I believe, to Ashlee Vance, who wrote the book on Elon), MB asked for a raise. E told her that if she was truly critical to SpaceX, it should not be able to operate in her absence (or something to that effect).  He suggested a 3-week experiment to test this hypothesis/her worth. This reminds me of something similar he once said to me, many years ago, after I came back from a week's visit with my family in Canada -- that his life had operated quite smoothly in my absence.  He was letting me know that I was an incompetent house manager. (He was not wrong.)  So of the different stories I have heard behind MB's departure from SpaceX, this is the one that resonates with me. (Although you would *never* use the word 'incompetent' in association with MB!)



Wherever MB is and whatever she is doing, I hope her life is fabulous. She and I have not always been on the same side, but I have -- and will always have -- tremendous respect for that remarkable woman.|||
