A breach of discount brokerage firm Scottrade has potentially compromised sensitive data of millions of customers. 



Federal and internal investigations did not determine exactly how many clients had data stolen, so Scottrade plans to notify and offer identity protection services to about 4.6 million clients whose information was in a breached database, the company confirmed Friday. The incident took place around late 2013 and early 2014.|||
