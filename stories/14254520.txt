I've always wondered why Sublime Text is so expensive. Sure, it provides a lot of value. It's a fantastic piece of software. But for most individuals, 70$ is not nothing. Especially when you can cancel the sporadic "please buy me" dialog so easily.

That's the point! ST's real customers are not individuals like you and me. They're companies that don't care about 70$ and buy licenses in bulk. Think of banks. That's where the money lies.

I just got my ST license. But if I may put forward a suggestion to the Sublime team:

Have a sale: One day only. Licenses for $25 instead of $70.

That one sale will get individuals to buy and easily bring tens of thousands of dollars.
