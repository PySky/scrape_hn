Not torrents of these files, but you will be soon.

These are REAL passwords. Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet. Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/

NOTE THAT UNTIL REV 2.0, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED

NOTE THAT THE DUE TO THE NEWLINE DUPLICATES ISSUE, 'WPA-Length' LISTS MAY INCLUDE LINES OF 7 CHARACTERS

Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename

I did not steal, phish, deceive or hack in any way to get hold of these passwords. All lines in these files were obtained through freely available means.
