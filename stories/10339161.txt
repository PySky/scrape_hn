I found the following in a copy of Wireless World in 1969, although as a callow student I failed to note the issue number or the author. this is the first time I have shared it. Enjoy.



The Neutron



When a pion an innocent proton seduces

with neither excuses

abuses

nor scorn

for its shameful condition

without intermission

the proton produces

a neutron is born.

 What love have you known,

 O neutron full grown,

 as you bombinate into the vacuum alone?

Its spin is a half and its mass is quite large

- about one A.M.U. - but it hasn’t a charge;

though it finds satisfaction 

in strong interaction,

it doesn’t experience coulombic attraction.

 But what can you borrow

 of love joy or sorrow,

 O neutron, when life has so short a tomorrow?

Within its

twelve minutes

comes disintegration,

which leaves an electron in mute desolation

& also another ingenuous proton

for other unscrupulous pions to dote on

& last a neutrino:

alas one can see no

fulfilment for such a leptonic bambino -

no loving, no sinning -

just spinning and spinning -

eight times through the globe without ever beginning...

a cycle mechanic -

no anguish or panic -

for such is the pattern of life inorganic.

 O better

 the fret a

 poor human endures

 than the neutron’s dichotic

 robotic

 amours.

Poetry is Nice but is not Physics. Neutrinos are very small, having the nominal quantity of mass and of energy. So to me, a neutrino has to be the particle of all deities.



Grazzie il mio amico Signore Enrico Fermi !

Pauli's Poltergeist



by John E. Gray





'Tis not often

a correction must be made

to a poem. 

Mercurial science, the subject:

particle physics.

A writer takes risks.



 Neutrinos, they are very small.

 They have no charge and have no mass

 And do not interact at all.

 The earth is just a silly ball

 To them, through which they simply pass. . . (Updike)



The error laid bare in Albuquerque.

Experimental results announced 

the case,

building for years.

Clinched.

They are not entirely without heft.



Done purely for the intellectual thrill, 

a beauty all their own.

Donning helmets with Cyclopean lights, 

physicists crowd a clattering elevator,

the daily commute down the mine shaft.

They trudge the rocky corridor 

to the detector.



The brightly lit subterranean lab

has 10,000 squinting electronic eyes

surrounding a Fulleresque scaffolding

Suspended inside an artificial lake.

10 stories deep, 

a large acrylic sphere holds

tons; a substance 

heavy water.

Beefed up hydrogen

an extra neutron in their cores.

Day by day

they wait:

a neutrino speeding through the earth

to collide

a heavy hydrogen nucleus.



The result 

a tiny flash (Cherenkov radiation),

from the center

a wink of light 

Sparked;

a traveler from the sun.

Cosmic Gall,

insouciant as neutrinos are.

They do occasionally consort,

with their neighbors.



A sad day for poetry.

Somehow, 

"They have no charge and little mass" 

doesn't ring the same.

Someone should write a poem about it.

Absolutely! It's a lovely poem and well worth a read, especially on May 11th. Thanks for the reminder. http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2010/06/universe-of-atoms-atom-in-universe.html

Today is Feynman's birthday. It might have been nice to (re)publish his poem. He would have been 97.|||
