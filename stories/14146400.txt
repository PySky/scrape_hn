Once in a while its important for us to take time out from our chaotic and crazy schedules and find some hours of peace and tranquility, where we ask ourselves some simple fundamental questions pertaining to our life, questions that enable us stock check, reflect and discover our exact plans and purpose in life, questions like, why are we still alive?, whats the reason for our existence?, what are we aiming to achieve or aspiring to become in life?. Whatever answers we have to these questions, indirectly helps us to identify with the vision we have for ourselves in life.

We’ve all heard the word “vision” being thrown around several times, in motivational speeches, empowerment conferences, leadership seminars, but not too often are we told about what the elements of a vision are, and how we can use those elements to ignite our vision or align our vision with our targets and goals.

 In order to ignite our vision and start living from the perspective of the end result of what we visualize, we must first be able to have a clear basic understanding of what a vision exactly is.

Understanding how to Identify our vision in its simplest form I believe should consist to 3 things, (a) why we exist (b) what are our core values (c) and what are does achievable aspirations we want for our future. Failure to properly Identify these 3 elements of a vision will most probably result in us having a blurred vision of our plans, purposes, goals or aspirations, And blurred visions normally results and accounts for why we have abandoned and halfway done project all around us.

For the first element that should consist in our vision, “why we exist” I guess only you the reader can answer that question yourself, we can be truthful or untruthful with ourselves about why we live, for some its to simply just follow the crowd and be told what to do, live from pay cheque to pay cheque, have an average Job “Just over broke” live in an average house, send their children to an average school, eat in average restaurants and generally just be average throughout their entire life till they die. For others, life’s about relentlessly trying on a daily basis to make a positive impact to themselves, their families and their community at large, its about thriving to leave a legacy for not only their children, but their children’s children also, its about reaching that place of self actualization and living a totally fulfilled life. And for these kind of people being consistent alone is important but not enough.

They are the kind of people that don’t expect to be discovering their core values on a daily basis, nor do they expect to learn new core values as of and when possible, they are deeply rooted in the fundamentals of what they believe are their core values and understand them also. Their vision is built based on that platform, they visualize their plans and purposes knowing and understanding fully well what they are capable of doing or achieving or instantly identifying what their limitations are. In the same vein, we need to always try as best as possible to identify what those core values that drive us in life are, Examples, if friends were selling drugs or prostituting themselves to make a living or gain luxurious returns, will you necessarily do the same?, if you woke up one morning broke, bursted and disgusted with a pile of debts at your doorstep would you hold on to the same values you have now?, if you had to live your life all over again, would these same values you hold on to now be something you’ll consider holding on to again?

 These questions are key to every vision we have for ourselves, our core values are timeless and should hardly ever change unless we chose to ignore them.

Finally, in trying to discover what are our achievable aspirations for the future, in the context of our vision, we need to be able to clearly distinguish what our instilled core values are, and the effect they currently have on what were presently doing, then also ask ourselves, will holding on to these same values affect what we plan to do in the future, these are important questions to ask, as our core values in whatever disposition we see them or ought to remain fixed, only then can we operate in a complete level of self awareness, understand our strength and weakness and be able to cave out a vision that we could be truly believe were capable of attaining or following till it becomes reality. Therefore don’t spend too much time visualizing the outcome of your vision, spend more time understanding the key inbuilt attributes that will enable you wake up every single day with the passion to manifest that vision, and that will still carry you along well after the vision has been manifested.

A vision is a conscious look into the future that you see or deem achievable for yourself in present day, any other definition that omits mans conscious awakening of a vision is a dream. #OurDailyDose|||
