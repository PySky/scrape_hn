Donald Trump instructed Nasa astronauts to get to Mars within his first term - or failing that, his second term, in a livestream with Peggy Whitson.

He was calling up the Space Station to congratulate Ms Whitson for her record-beating stay in Space: she's been up there for more than 534 days, which was the previous record.

The President congratulated her via video link from the Oval OfficeÂ alongside his daughter, Ivanka, and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins.|||
