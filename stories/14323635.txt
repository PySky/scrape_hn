Open Radar is infinite and lots of the bugs live from one version to another. Let's keep track of the major bugs here. Maybe someone will hear.

Feel free to open a PR if you don't see a major bug that you encounter. Would be great to see the votes for the PRs to decide on impact.

Size D: more than 100 000 lines of code

I start my iOS app as usually by Command+R, I start seeing the launch screen of my app and then it hangs. What is especially annoying is that Xcode stops responding to Stop action via both "Command+." and also Stop button doesn't work: it is clickable and is of solid black color but clicking on it doesn't change anything, the only thing is that I get: " *** If you believe this error represents a bug, please attach the log file at .....log "

The same issue happens to C++ projects when building executable targets: Xcode hangs, stop button enabled, nothing in the console.

The right workaround to prevent this from happening is to always false start a project and then stop it. Then it is possible to run a project without problems.

Apple Bug Reporter promised to resolve this by Xcode 9.|||
