This is a very simple C++ Makefile template, that can be used to get small to medium sized C++ projects up and running quickly and easily. The Makefile assumes source code for the project is broken up into two groups, headers (*.hpp) and implementation files (*.cpp).



 The source code and directory layout for the project is comprised of three main directories (include, src and build), under which other directories, containing code, would reside. The layout used in the example is as follows:

The Makefile supports building of a single target application called program which once built will be placed in the build/apps directory. All associated objects will be placed in the build/objects directory. The following is a listing of the Makefile in its entirety:

The Makefile and an example code and directory layout can be downloaded from: HERE

The following commands can be used with this particular Makefile:

The following is the expected output when the command "make clean all" is executed:|||
