SyClick: Symposium on Click Modular Router was November 23-24, 2009, Ghent, Belgium! An excellent time was had. Video of the presentations is now available.

This is the DokuWiki for the Click modular router. Click was originally developed at MIT with subsequent development at Mazu Networks, ICIR, UCLA, and Meraki.
