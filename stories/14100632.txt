The MySQL Development Team is happy to announce the first GA release of InnoDB Cluster–our integrated, native, full stack HA solution for MySQL. You can see highlights of the changes and improvements made since the RC release here, and you can download the GA packages from our MySQL APT (Ubuntu, Debian) and YUM (Redhat, OEL, Fedora) repositories or from dev.mysql.com.

InnoDB Cluster consists of the following three GA components:

The GA release of InnoDB Cluster builds upon the great work that the MySQL Development Team has done on Group Replication, filling out the rest of the stack for setup, management, orchestration, and client routing.

The official documentation can now be found in the InnoDB Cluster User Guide.

This is the first GA release of InnoDB Cluster–our end-to-end native HA and Scaling solution for MySQL–and we would love to get your feedback, so please try it out today and let us know what you think! What would you like to see added or changed? Did you encounter any apparent bugs or other issues? Please let us know here in the comments, via a bug report, or a support ticket.

Thank you for using MySQL!|||
