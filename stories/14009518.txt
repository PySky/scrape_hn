After years of research and negotiations with global regulators, Stream Powered is rolling out a digital power distribution network on a trial basis. Dead batteries and charging cords are now a thing of the past! If you have a reliable Internet connection, you can download power, even over Wi-Fi!

To read about our exciting technology, check out the Tech tab and then, if you are interested, you can participate in a free trial. Once you are satisfied you are receiving clean, malware-free power, you may apply to be part of our Beta Tester Program and receive free Internet power for life.

Until now, device manufacturers had to allocate between 20 to 33 percent of their interior volume to batteries. Imagine the possibilities when manufacturers are free to either shrink their devices or add new and exciting features. Research indicates that 95 out of 100 users would prefer more features in the same-sized case as their current device. The POIP (Power Over the Internet Protocol) Power Broadcast Standard 4 allows manufacturers to devote 80 percent less space to power than before.|||

Stream Powered is now bringing Power Over the Internet Protocol (PoIP) to the public through a beta trial!
