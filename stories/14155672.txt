Oh boy, what a year it has been! We crunched the numbers and here they are, so you can know what our first year looked like.

April 2017 marks our first birthday! Can you believe 3di Poland has been in operation for that long? Time flies when you’re having fun.

Paul Ballard is the managing director of 3di Information Solutions. He met Pawel Kowaluk at UA Conference 2015 in Southampton. Paul had been thinking about expanding his operations to Eastern Europe, considering Czech Republic or Slovakia, but then he came across Pawel. And Pawel had one advantage over other potential business partners in different countries. Pawel was there. He was the man in the room.

So Pawel became the first person in the Kraków office, haunting the hallways until April 2016. That’s when the first project began. That’s when we started counting out the days.

We reviewed year one, and here are the numbers.

We focused just on the important metrics. If you would like to know any others, let us know in the comments below.|||
