The Minio Haskell Client SDK provides simple APIs to access Minio and Amazon S3 compatible object storage server.

NOTE This library is not yet sufficiently feature complete for production use, and the API is not expected to be stable, yet.

Tests can be run with:

A section of the tests use the remote Minio Play server at by default. For library development, using this remote server maybe slow. To run the tests against a locally running Minio live server at , just set the environment to any value (and unset it to switch back to Play).

Documentation can be locally built with:
