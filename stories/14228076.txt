This is a simple script that exploits the Tinder API to allow a person to build a facial dataset.

Having worked with facial datasets in the past, I have often been disappointed. The datasets tend to be extremely strict in their structure, and are usually too small. Tinder gives you access to thousands of people within miles of you. Why not leverage Tinder to build a better, larger facial dataset?

To run the script tinderGetPhotos.py, one must first do the following:

I have used this script to create a dataset of 20,000 male and female individuals. This dataset can be found here on Kaggle.

UPDATE: I have spoken with representatives at Kaggle, and they have received a request from Tinder to remove the dataset. As such, the facial data set previously hosted on Kaggle has been removed. A TechCrunch article about the dataset in question can be found here.

I plan on using the aforementioned dataset with TensorFlow's Inception to try and create a CNN that is capable of distinguishing between men and women.

UPDATE: I have created a CNN capable of classifying men and women with 86.5% accuracy. This CNN was trained without using any images scraped from Tinder. The code for this project can be found in the GenderClassifierCNN repository.|||
