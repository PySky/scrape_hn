Recently, I started to use, or actually — misuse, a service called “If This, Then That” which is written and called mostly IFTTT. Modern tools and applications solve one problem very good, and I like it. The drawback from it is that connectivity is the worst problem we’re facing right now. IFTTT came to the rescue by providing an interface to connect all these services, and I’d like to use it well. However, I have no good use for applets right now. Most of what I tried, actually, annoyed me:

Bah. That sucks. I really want to use IFTTT, but I need to find a good use. I don’t hold a software engineer role for the next couple of months because I volunteered to command in the tech officer training course. However, lately, I started to think about things I could do with IFTTT when I return to software engineering:

Software developers, artists, musicians, and just everybody: what cool IFTTT applets do you have and use regularly? I’d like to experiment with cool stuff!|||

I use multiple types of software every day. I’d like to connect them to maximize productivity and organization.
