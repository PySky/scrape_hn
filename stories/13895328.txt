Go to the welcome page of AWS ElasticBeanstalk. At "Select a platform", choose Node and click "Launch now". Setting up environment and sample app will take 2-3 minutes. Sample app will be created with pre-defined default settings. You can click "Create new application" and fine-tune settings manually. At the end, you will see dashboard of your application:

Go to the application's URL (something like: Default-Environment.ycn9jgnj6p.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com), confirm that your app is live and well:

Upload your app to Github, no need to upload node_modules, make sure to include package.json. You will be able to specify build commands, such as , on Semaphore. This repo contains a sample app, ready for deploy.

Next step is authorize Semaphore to access your code on Github. Follow this simple steps:

In the section "Preparing for deploy", we will prepare project for deploy by specifying build commands and etc in "Project settings".

On AWS dashboard, go to "My Security Credentials", click "Users", click "Add user":
