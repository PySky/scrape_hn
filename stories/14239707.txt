You want to create a new Android Application. Maybe you are already a developer and you want a professional application in no time or you have No Idea of Programming but you have a dream to create your first app. In both cases you have come to the right place for the Develop of your First Game. 



In the previous video, we have already started working in our first application in Thunkable. So if you want to see the Front end of an application you can click here and watch this video first.

 In this video we will start the fun part by Develop your First Game without coding programming, by developing the functionalities of our app. 

As you can remember this is our first screen. So this is the first thing that the user will see. The only thing that we should implement is the connection of the first page with the actual game.

 First, we will go to Blocks. Here we can see the functionality of the Button 1. The goal here is when the user presses the button1 to change the screen and go to the game. So we can use the first block and then we will go to the control in order to change something in the system and we will choose open another screen. Finally, we will write what screen we want to open. So we will use text. And more specifically the first one. And we will write Game, which is the name of the second screen.



Now we will start the development of the actual game. First, we need a strategy. It is easier if we transform the 3 options into numbers. So from now on 1 is scissors 2 is paper and 3 is rock.

 

 Every time that a new game starts, the user will choose one of the numbers and the computer will choose one of the numbers randomly, in order to create a simple app.



 Now we should set up the rules of the game. As you can understand in the case of scissors (1) and paper (2) the scissors (1) wins. Also if we have 2 and 3 the 2 wins. Finally if we have 1 and 3 the 3 wins.



 We will name the variable of Player Pl and the variable of Computer Cp. And the results of the game Res with 1 if Player wins and 0 if Computer wins.

First of all we should use the notifier. In this way, we can create a notification that shows the result of every round.

 Then we will start developing the blocks. First, we will initialize the variables. For that we will go to the variables section and then initialize global variable. Then we can change the name of the player and make it equal to 0. In addition, we will copy and paste this command line for the computer variable. But here we should use a random variable for 1 to 3.
