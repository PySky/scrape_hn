Visited Spillhistorie.no today and noticed that it is now possible to play a selection of old Macintosh games in your browser thanks to Archive.org:

A collection of emulated software for the early Macintosh computer, created by Apple as the successor to the Apple II series. Simple, powerful and a new path in computing, the Macintoshâ€™s graphics-based operating system changed the face of computing permanently.

Revisit old classics like Dark Castle, Space Invaders, Lode Runner, Airborne! and Pyramid of Peril.



Iâ€™ve never been into Macintosh, but will try some of these games out of curiosity. ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for visiting my blog and see you soon!|||
