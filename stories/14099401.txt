Russia’s Foreign Ministry says its website frequently comes under distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks from IP addresses registered in the US.

“Nowadays, we are facing this regularly. I am speaking on behalf of Russia’s Foreign Ministry website, but the sites of other agencies are hit by attacks as well,” the ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday.

The botnets infected with malware have amounted to 88 percent of the visits to the site, Zakharova added.

The Russian diplomat also noted that three cyber attacks targeting the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website were registered in February alone.

Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the number of cyber attacks on Russian servers had tripled in 2016, compared to its previous year.

The new revelations come at a time that the US government has accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party emails to help the campaign of Republican President Donald Trump.

Russian officials have repeatedly denied the claims that Moscow tried to influence the 2016 US presidential election.|||
