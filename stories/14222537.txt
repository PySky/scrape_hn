(24 February 2016, Beijing, China) Hurun Report today released the Hurun Global Rich List 2016, a ranking of the US dollar billionaires currently found in the world. Wealth calculations are a snapshot of 15 January 2016.  This is the fifth year of the ranking.

The Hurun Global Rich List 2016 ranked 2188 billionaires from 68 countries, up 99 from last year, in another record-breaking year for the world’s billionaires.

Total wealth increased by 9% to US$7.3 trillion, more than the GDP of Germany and the UK combined and coming close to half that of the USA.

729 individuals saw their wealth decrease. 102 dropped out of last year’s list. Russian billionaires lost US$130bn, on the back of a further 19% drop in the Russian Rouble and with lacklustre performance of mining, metals and energy.

The average age is 64, same as the last 2 years.69% are self-made.

Rupert Hoogewerf, Chairman and Chief Researcher of Hurun Report, said, “Despite its own slowdown and falling stockmarkets, China minted more new billionaires than any other country in the world last year, mainly on the back of new listings.  Growth in billionaires for the rest of the world was held back by a slowdown in the global economy, the strengthening of the US dollar and the drop in oil prices. The number of billionaires, however, has jumped 50% since 2013.”

Measuring the degree to which Billionaires are Self-Made

Hurun Report measures the degree to which billionaires are inherited or self-made. The scorecard is out of five, where 1 is inherited and not active in business, and 5 is self-made without help from parents.

Self-made with a little help from parents was the most common route to becoming a billionaire. An example is Mark Zuckerberg, who was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, one of America’s best-known private high schools. Second was self-made without help from parents, most of whom are coming from China and the US. Third was inheriting a business and growing it into a much bigger entity, eg Rupert Murdoch.

9% of the Self-Made ‘4s’ and ‘5s’ are female, whilst 70% of the ‘1s’ are female.

59 individuals, or 2.6%, are from the 4th generation or more.

35% of new billionaires reside in Asia. Asia is drawing away from North America with 207 new billionaires to take it to 1022 individuals, followed by North America with 584 billionaires and Europe 441.

Europe added US$253bn this year, 18% higher than that of last year.

South America lost US$37bn mainly on account of 21% correction of BOVESPA index and 35% depreciation of Brazilian Real.

Oceania is the only continent where a woman leads the billionaires’ list. (Georgina Rinehart, US$16bn).

With a cumulative net worth of US$84bn, Africa has 29 billionaires on the Hurun Global Rich List 2016. Aliko Dangote, 58, of Dangote Cements leads the pack with US$10bn.
