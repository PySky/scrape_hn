Live from London, UK, Prime Live Events: Robbie Williams at St. John at Hackney Church. The award-winning and multi-platinum singer performs songs from his new album The Heavy Entertainment Show, as well as classic songs.

John Legend brings a little Darkness and Light to The Round Chapel when he takes to the stage for this exclusive Prime Live Event. Celebrating the release of his new album of the same name, the Oscar and Grammy winner makes the switch from the bright lights of arenas like The O2 to one of Londonâ€™s most intimate and characterful venues.|||
