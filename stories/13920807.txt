Generate a CiphertextBlock + Plaintext from AWS KMS -> Split CiphertextBlock into data_key and hmac_key -> Encode secret as binary and encrypt with AES (using the CiphertextBlock) using Counter Method -> Generate HMAC -> base64 encode the data_key -> base64 encode the Ciphertext of the encrypted secret -> hex encode the hmac value -> store this inside of DynamoDB with the digest used

Get the row from DynamoDB based on the secret provided -> base64 decode data_key -> base64 decode contents (the encrypted secret) -> hex decode the hmac -> split the key into data_key and hmac -> generate hmac value -> verify integrity of hmacs -> decrypt using AES with the key and Counter Method -> Decode from binary to string and return|||
