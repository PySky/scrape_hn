Follow me on a step-by-step hacking journey where we pwn a high-profile fashion company. From zero initial access to remotely recording board meetings, we will detail every custom script and technique used in this attack, drawn from real-life findings, to paint the most realistic picture possible. 

Whether you are a wannabe pentester dreaming about real-life hacking experiences or an experienced ethical hacker tired of countless Metasploit tutorials, you will find unique gems in this book for you to try:



•Playing with Kerberos

•Bypassing Citrix & Applocker 

•Mainframe hacking

•Fileless WMI persistence

•NoSQL injections

•Wiegand protocol

•Exfiltration techniques

•Antivirus evasion tricks

•And much more advanced hacking techniques



I have documented almost every tool and custom script used in this book. I strongly encourage you to test them out yourself and master their capabilities (and limitations) in an environment you own and control.



Hack (safely) the Planet!
