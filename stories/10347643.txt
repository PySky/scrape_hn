IN a discovery that overturns centuries of mathematical tradition, a group of graduate students and young researchers has discovered a way to check even the longest and most complicated proof by scrutinizing it in just a few spots.   The finding, which some mathematicians say seems almost magical, depends upon transforming the set of logical statements that constitute a proof into a special mathematical form in which any error is so amplified as to be easily detectable.
