Airtel Tanzania, Tigo Tanzania and Zantel have announced the launch of a cross-network mobile money service in Tanzania named Taifa Moja.

“We are committed to creating a cashless society, with customers able to enjoy flexible payment options,” said Moses Alphonce, Marketing Manager at Airtel Tanzania Airtel Money.

It is hoped that Taifa Moja will make it easier for customers on the mobile networks to perform mobile money transactions.

Speaking in Dar es Salaam, Alphonce added that Taifa Moja also assists with financial inclusion by getting more people to participate in the formal financial system and help improve customers’ living standards by simplifying transactions.

"With Taifa Moja, we are sure that we will be able to reach many customers and also increase our number of transactions" added Alphonce.

Tanzania became the first Afrikan country with mobile money interoperability, followed by Madagascar in September 2016.

Tigo and Airtel are the largest mobile operators in Tanzania with about 12 million subscribers each, and Zantel - which mainly operates on the island of Zanzibar - has about two million subscribers, meaning that Taifa Moja will enable about 26 million Tanzanians to send money to each other regardless of which of the three operators they use.|||
