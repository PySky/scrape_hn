Australia could get an extra 2 gigawatts of electricity – the boost Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull wants from an expanded Snowy Mountains hydroelectricity scheme – through batteries and connecting a quarter of the houses that already have solar panels.

The same increase in power could come from equipping 400,000 solar homes with a battery such as a 5-kilowatt Tesla Powerwall 2, a Tesla spokesman said on Thursday.

It would be a quicker process than expanding the hydro dam, which could take at least four years.

"If you were to take one quarter of the Australian households with solar and apply a Powerwall, allowing half of that Powerwall to be aggregated into the grid, you'd have the same amount of power as would come from the boost of an expanded Snowy Mountains hydro at a fraction of the cost and a time frame of one to two years," the spokesman said.|||

There's a quicker way to score an extra 2000 megawatts than expanding the Snowy scheme, Tesla says.
