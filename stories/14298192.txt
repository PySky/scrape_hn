A concerned passenger took a photo of Captain Amir Akhtar Hashmi who appeared to be fast asleep on the Pakistan International Airlines plane on April 26.

The image showed him lying on a seat in business class shortly after the flight had left Islamabad, Pakistan, according to Pakistani newspaper Dawn.

‘Passenger complained that while the captain was sleeping in business class cabin, the passenger did not feel safe,’ the air hostess’s report said.

The same passenger is said to have taken the snap, which was posted on social media shortly afterwards.

Captain Hashmi was in charge of the aircraft, which had 300 passengers on board, and was training his first officer.

Mr Hashmi, who is ex-president of the Pakistan Air Lines Pilots Association (PALPA), has now been suspended while an investigation takes place.

Pilots are allowed to take ‘short periods of sleep’ in a cockpit cabin  when operating in a team of two on long haul flights.

The second pilot would take control of the plane while his colleague took a rest.

Danyal Gilani, General Manager of Public Affairs and PIA spokesperson, said: ‘Capt Amir Hashmi is off from flying duties due to investigation of the happening.’
