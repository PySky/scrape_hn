Description: The iMasons Data Center Performance Index (DCPI) is a new global rating system that measures the actual performance of colocation data centers. The index applies letter grades to a data center across three categories – Availability, Efficiency and Environmental. The intent is to give colocation customers a way to see how a datacenter performs over time, helping them make more informed decisions. It also provides a common mechanism for providers to showcase their performance to the industry.|||
