So, you’ve found Open Collective and your open source project is ready for community financial support. Great! Here’s how to nail it.

Open Collective is designed to fund collaborative communities, because that’s how open source is built. So it’s important that your key contributors feel like it’s theirs. Because it is!

Start a discussion wherever your community hangs out, to let people know what to expect and give them a chance to share their ideas and concerns about raising money. If contributors feel a sense of co-ownership with fundraising, like they do with the codebase, they will be your first donors and most passionate champions.

Pro tip: Receive Open Collective Notifications in your Slack or Gitter, so participants can see when you get donations and pay for expenses. Here’s how.

Have you ever sat down and very succinctly articulated why exactly your project exists, and what it offers the world? Can you explain your mission in one paragraph? How about one sentence?

Your collective page explains what you are going to do with the funding, your goals, and your roadmap. The better you communicate what you’re doing, the more people will support you. It’s ok if you’re not a marketing expert! You just need to be clear and honest about the value your project provides.

Here are some mission statements from active collectives:

Early momentum is important in crowdfunding. People like donating to projects that other people are also supporting, because they want to have collective impact. Reach out to your potential funders before you launch, and ask them to donate on the first day to get the ball rolling.|||
