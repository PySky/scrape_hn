If we based our answer to SECURITY PURPOSES, we probably say it IS A YES! On the other hand if we only need an EASY ACCESS or SIMPLE PHONE LOCKS to gain access to our mobile device then we probably say NO. Even if IT ONLY TAKES 2 SECONDS and when needed to open by our partners in life they can open it with the password key. (If they knew it)

Reasons why we say YES:

Enough reason for me because I'm a SECURED type of person, though IM LOYAL. Hahahaha 



PS: This is just my OPINION.|||
