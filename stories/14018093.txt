To demonstrate some of the strengths of Resin v1.0 RC2 I'm comparing its indexing and querying performance with the market leader on the .net platform, Lucene.Net v3.0.3.

In the last test Resin beat Lucene hands-down when it came down to querying speed on a eight-core system, but struggled when indexing a large batch of 10M wikimedia documents.

Same test data was used as before, an English Wikimedia JSON dump. I measured the indexing time when creating an index of 10M documents. I store and analyze all fields except the "id" field which is only stored.

As test machine I have used a twelve year old dual core Intel machine with SSDs and 8GB RAM.

While indexing I read from one disk and wrote to another.|||
