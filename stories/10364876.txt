It turns out that Notch isn't the only guy who can afford to splurge on some swanky digs thanks to the magic of Minecraft. 23-year-old YouTuber Jordan "CaptainSparklez" Maron recently splurged on a $4.5 million pad above the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, and while it may not be in the league of Casa Notch, Maron didn't make Minecraftâ€”he just plays it.

The house is 4100 square feet, according to Variety, with three bedrooms, five baths, glass-railed terraces on each of the three floors, an outdoor fireplace, sunken wet bar, and a terrace with a stainless-steel barbecue, "party-sized spa," and infinity swimming pool. Suddenly John Carmack's Ferrari seems a bit trite, doesn't it?

Jordan Maron's new house isn't far from Notch's place.
