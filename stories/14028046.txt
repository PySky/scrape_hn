My house has been powered by IoT since July 2016, all designed and manufactured by my home automation startup (https://hivee.io).

My house has cameras but they are all outside, no cameras inside the house for privacy purposes, so no way to see what was going on inside the house.

Here is an HTML5 tool I build to see all the activity in my house, divided by activity in areas of the house. Every line represents an entry of activity in the database, of any type, wether is a sensor being activated, a door being opened or a device being controlled.|||
