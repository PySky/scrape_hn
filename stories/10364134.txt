This is a list of recruiters and recruiting firms which made unsolicited recruiting calls, and/or sent recruiting email which demonstrated a — generally profound — lack of understanding of my résumé. My take is that this constitutes a list of the names of people and firms which neither side of the recruiting equation should consider using. The names listed are generally based on self-identification, as conveyed via voice or in email headers.

This page was started in November of 2013 (with a small amount of information from earlier in 2013 added retroactively). I do my best to maintain its accuracy, however I make no iron-clad guarantee.|||
