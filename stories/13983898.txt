In her new book, "What If It Does Work Out?," Susie Moore interviewed James Altucher about why you should work for yourself.

Susie: What facts do you tell people who still believe in the old world order (safe corporate job, 401(k), single paycheck)?

James: I don't like to tell people they are wrong. Nobody listens when you tell them that.

We want to believe (I want to believe) that I am right all the time.

So I don't tell people when I think they are wrong. I just point out the times I realized I was wrong.|||

Many people still believe the "old world order" is the way to wealth.
