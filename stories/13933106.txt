Slack bots — they’re fun, they’re useful, and people are building new businesses around bot interaction models on a daily basis. A few weeks ago we launched a quick guide to building an Alexa Skill in 7 Minutes with StdLib to a great response, and we’re excited to show off more of the capabilities of the platform we’re building at Standard Library alongside with Slack!

If you’re not familiar with Standard Library, we’re a Function as a Service software library. The easiest way to think of us is to imagine if AWS Lambda and GitHub had a child, then asked NPM and Twilio to be the godparents — scalable microservices with no server administration, easy command line management, version immutability, service discovery, and the ability to charge customers for premium services you’ve built on a per-request basis.

We’re confident you’ll find StdLib to be the fastest way to get a Slack Bot up and running in production, so without further ado, let’s get started building!

Once you’ve created your StdLib service in Minute 5, you’ll get a file but can also follow along via GitHub in the stdlib/utils.templates slack folder.|||
