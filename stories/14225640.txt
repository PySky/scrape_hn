The limited amount of area that's available in small spaces often pushes designers to be creative in laying out various elements like the bedroom, bathroom and stairs. This is especially true in tiny houses, where the stairs going up to the second level loft (if there is one) often are shrunk down into ladder-like sizes, or compromised into an alternating stair tread form.

Of course, there are even more alternatives. Placing a flight of stairs right in the middle of the home is one, or placing it at the very back is yet another. Colorado's Tiny Houses By Darla does the latter, as seen here. Rather than taking up precious space in the middle or at one side, the stairs are placed all the way (and out of the way) in the back.

There's no image of the stairs themselves, so we wonder if it may be quite steep to go upstairs. In any case, there is a handrail, and the leftover space underneath the stairs is used to house extra storage and a larger refrigerator.

It's a simple maneuver, but by relegating the stairs to another location, the kitchen area is opened up, allowing for extra counter space right in the centre, where all the action is. Though, that extra side ledge covering the wheel well is a bit awkward and looks like it might be a missed opportunity to add something creative (a low shelf? extra seating or a fold-down surface? Or maybe not, if you're bringing your own furniture in).

The rest of the house is attractive as well: an upholstered seating area, a main sleeping loft, a secondary loft that's accessible by an unobtrusive built-in ladder, and a bathroom with a sliding door and a generous bathtub.

With the contrast between its rustic elements and its bright pops of colour and patterned materials, this is a pretty little house indeed, made to feel that much larger thanks to its clever (and relatively unconventional) placement of the stairs. For more, visit Tiny Houses By Darla.|||

There's more than one way to go up in a small space, and this is one smart alternative.
