Over time, I've noticed a lot of interesting information, code, and people centered around topics related to asynchronous programming using PHP. I thought it might be useful to try to catalog them all in one place. This repository is the result and fairly experimental in concept. Feel free to file an issue or submit a pull request if you think there's anything that should be added or changed.
