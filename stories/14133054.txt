For over three years, the GitHub Developer Program has been a launchpad for developers—from testing their newest applications to growing their biggest businesses. Now, we're excited to build on what's made the program successful for members and make it even more accessible.

We're opening the program up to all developers, even those who don't have paid GitHub accounts. That means you can join the program no matter which stage of development you're in.

We're also introducing participation levels that come with existing program perks from us and our partners, like development licenses for GitHub Enterprise, and a new category of benefits that help you build and scale even faster. 17,000 developers around the world are already aboard—if you're kicking around ideas for applications that integrate with GitHub, now's the time to get started!

Here's how it works: Depending on the size of your user base, you'll be placed into one of three levels. For each group, we've made a set of benefits, resources, and tools available to help you advance to the next stage of development. If you're already a member of the GitHub Developer Program, you'll get an email with information about your level and available benefits.

We're so excited to see the applications you're building grow, and cheers to the thousands that have already seen success through the GitHub Developer Program: CircleCI, SRC:CLR, and GitPrime just to name a few.|||
