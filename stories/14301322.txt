 and focus on doing your best work instead.

 You can see how you spent your time and how productive you were,

 with a great timeline that shows when you did what.

 It even automatically recognizes blocks of time that belong together!

You need to enter time manually? Timing supports that, too â€”

with the added benefit of tracking when you are most productive.

And if you need to bill clients, Timing lets you generate great reports.|||

Timing helps you bill more time by automatically tracking your time. It logs apps, websites, and documents. No more start/stop timers!
