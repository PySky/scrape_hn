Sometimes, you just want to learn the internal mechanics of , but unfortunately there is only one box at hand, and you don’t want to bother to install Virtual Machines on it. In this scenario, you certainly can build a cluster on one host, and this tutorial will provide a detailed guide:

(1) Make sure the environment has been ready on your system, if not, please follow this document to setup it. Also remember add into environment variable.

Execute command to check whether is well equipped:

(3) Modify the configuration file. E.g., on my , the file is :

Restart , and check whether the new takes effect:

(4) Run “ ” command to create token for the cluster:

You should notice that the argument of option is the and port of the engine on this host. Since we have set the in configuration file in step , the should be whilst port is .

(6) Open a new terminal, and create the manager of the cluster. Because port is occupied by engine, we use another available port:

Through the log, you can see the node and manager have communicated successfully.

Now, you can think a engine is listening on , but actually, there is one cluster behind , even though the cluster has only one node. You can play client commands now, such as get the cluster info:|||
