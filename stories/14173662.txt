In Germany we were taught the value of privacy the hard way - think about Gestapo and Stasi. In our digital age all-round surveillance has become alarmingly easy. I write code to protect our private information from today's Orwellian threats.

Every one of us has the right to express any idea freely, or to keep it secret. That’s how we’ve managed to build our democratic societies. As a citizen of a free democracy it is my obligation to protect my private information. Encryption is the only available key to keep my messages secret.

In Germany we have a great traditional song: "Our thoughts are free, who can guess them?" No one. We as one of the few mail providers can't even read them. I fight for privacy because that’s the cornerstone of freedom and democracy. My information belongs to me.|||
