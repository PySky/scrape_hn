Amazon has launched a new Etsy-esque portal dedicated to handmade, artisanal products.

Handmade at Amazon features jewelry, artwork, stationery and party supplies, kitchen and dining, furniture, home decor, and bedding, and serves to connect buyers and merchants — from more than 60 countries — who prefer to steer clear of mass-produced goods.

At present, there are some 80,000 handcrafted items on the site, many of which can be personalized on request.

The goods can be filtered so shoppers can search by country-of-origin, while each artisan profile details how the products were made. And for those in the U.S., you can dig down and search sellers by which state they are in.

Though Amazon has emerged as the de facto ecommerce emporium-of-choice for millions, some would argue that much of the local shopping experience has been lost in the process. And this is something Amazon has been striving to replace through a number of initiatives — today’s launch is the latest in a long line of dedicated sites on Amazon that focus on one specific thing.

Back in March, Amazon Exclusives launched to help shoppers find weird and unique stuff, which came shortly after Amazon Elements was introduced to focus on “ethical” own-brand goods. Then there’s an art marketplace for fine art, drawings, prints, and photographs.

There’s clearly demand for unique products, and this is something Amazon is evidently looking to cater to.|||
