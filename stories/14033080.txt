According to the Qualcomm Tricorder XPrize device requirements, the research teams were expected to develop a device with the following characteristics:

- The device cannot weight more than five pounds

- It has to be able to diagnose 13 medical conditions

- It has to capture five real-time health vital signs

A tricorder-like medical diagnostic device will have an array of benefits for patients and medical practitioners alike around the world.

A medical portable device of such characteristics could aid and expand the reach of medical testing in countless limited-resource areas around the world, areas that lack or have limited access to well-equipped and staffed clinical labs.

A real-life tricorder medical device would make testing more convenient, and less invasive. In the near future, patients will get treatment faster, potentially saving lives. In many cases, patients will be using the device themselves as long as it is connected to their smartphone, adding to the Internet of Things (IoT) explosion of connected deviced. Daily decision-making will be easier and more accurate with the right health information right at your fingertips.|||

Research teams have been working on the creation of a mobile diagnostic device inspired by the fictional medical Tricorder from Star Trek.
