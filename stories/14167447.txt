Devuan GNU+Linux is a fork of Debian without systemd. The latest 1.0 release candidate series marks an important milestone towards the sustainability and the continuation of Devuan as a universal base distribution. Since the Exodus declaration in 2014, infrastructure has been put in place to support Devuan’s mission to offer users control over their system. Devuan Jessie provides continuity as a safe upgrade path from Debian 7 (Wheezy) and a flawless switch from Debian 8 (Jessie) that ensures the right to Init Freedom and avoids entanglement.

Devuan aliases its releases using minor planet names as codenames. Devuan file names follow this release naming scheme.

Various operating system distributions have already started adopting Devuan as a base OS. Here below a list in order of chronological appearance. When reviewing Devuan we do recommend taking derivatives in consideration: they harness the power of our base distribution targeting it at specific usage and this is exactly what we mean to achieve with Devuan. The default desktop provided by classic installer-iso images shouldn’t be considered the way we mean to use Devuan on the desktop.|||
