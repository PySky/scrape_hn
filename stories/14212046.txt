 Now on it’s 4th year, we’re thrilled to be joining forces once again with our partners Gene Kim and IT Revolution, bringing you the 2017 DevOps Enterprise Summit, San Francisco (DOES17).

The 3 day conference will be returning to the Hilton Union Square, November 13-15, 2017.

Last year’s event was a huge success, and this year will be even better. The conference will once again boast a packed lineup of memorable speakers, networking, insights, and practical takeaways. You’ll hear from fellow practitioners in large, complex organizations sharing concrete examples of improvements and transformations as a result of their DevOps initiatives.

We’re excited to share that the ticket sales and Call for Presentations for DOES17 are now open!

We want to hear from you! If you have a DevOps transformation story to share or are a subject matter expert, please submit a proposal for consideration. Much like previous years, the event will be structured with keynote presentations and breakouts featuring stories from around the world. To prepare, review what we’re looking for and watch the video with Gene Kim, past speaker Margo Cronin, and programming committee member Damon Edwards for tips for a successful proposal.

Electric Cloud is also presenting at DevOps Enterprise Summit, Europe, happening June 5-6 in London, UK.
