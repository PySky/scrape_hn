Recently, I ran into some computational limits on my laptop while doing training some CNNs.  I have a desktop, but given a tough enough problem, even it won’t suffice.  Thus, the cloud is eventually going to be the only available option.  Unfortunately, the cloud is so far away that I still can’t find it despite everyone talking about it, so how would we ever find the notebook?… Seriously though, most cloud operating systems don’t come installed with a desktop environment (think Ubuntu server).  But let’s say you go ahead and install a desktop environment or start off with Ubuntu desktop.  You’ll have to use X11 to send all your browser information through ssh, which can be slow; additionally, you’ll need to configure Xorg on the server.  I’ll show you an easier solution that uses ssh tunneling and only requires ssh and jupyter notebook to be installed on your cloud instance.  This post uses an EC2 instance from Amazon running Ubuntu server, but the method should work for any remote linux machine with ssh installed.

ssh into your machine by opening a new terminal and entering

In that terminal open Jupyter Notebook with

On your local machine, open a new terminal and enter|||
