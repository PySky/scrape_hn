s3gopher is a light-weight S3 library using Go. It's built on top of Amazon's offical AWS SDK.

Found the official SDK to require a lot of boilerplate if you just want to read / write a single or few files from a S3 bucket or list its content.

() { s3gopher. { Bucket: , ACL: , Region: , Credentials: s3gopher. {AccessKey: , SecretAccessKey: }, } , s3gopher. (config) bucket. () err != { fmt. ( ) } List content of the bucket, show latest additions first , o. () Get the first file from the bucket , bucket. (fileList[ ]. ) err != { fmt. ( ) } When was the file last modified? fmt. (o. ) fmt. (o. ) Do something with the file's data bucket. (o) err != { fmt. ( Something bad happended when writing the data. ) } }|||
