If you are just starting out on your fitness journey you may have seen LISS thrown around quite a bit. What is LISS and its importance?

LISS stands for low intensity steady state cardio. It's pretty self explanatory on what it is, maintaining a steady pace at low intensity while performing cardio. This is great for those who want to build their cardio up without the feeling of passing out.

Whether you are a fitness expert or a novice, LISS is important all around. Beginners can use LISS to gradually increase their cardio abilities, and those that are experts can use LISS for a warm up or recovery while still burning fat.

Why we like LISS

LISS is great for both beginners and experts. For those who absolutely hate cardio, this is a great option since it's short, and isn't hard to perform. There are so many added benefits to adding LISS to your normal routine. If you are skeptical just give it a try at the end of your next training session.
