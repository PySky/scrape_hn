I didn't even have to browse halfway down the page, and just above GMA Funding Hard Money Direct Nationwide Lenders, bingo. WIC didn't mean anything to me, but (U), often used to indicate an Unclassified document or system, did.

Unclassified doesn't mean it's not sensitive material, just that access to the information isn't restricted to clearance holders, and ironically for our purposes marking documents or sites as unclassified flags them as interesting.

As some may have noted the other night along with me, this site was pretty interesting.

Indeed, with the geography in mind it's easy to identify the two bay bridges in the drone footage.

Ranger1 seems to be a true drone, operating autonomously rather than being actively flown by a remote pilot (in which case it is simply a UAV or RPA, remotely piloted aircraft). The camera seems to track automatically between a high altitude view down to near surface-level, with the cross-hairs training on various watercraft.

Best guess is that this is a Predator of the Eglin UAV "battlelab," although there are a few other large, medium altitude candidates that are somewhat less likely.

The automated camera movement causes the wing and fuselage to occasionally come into view, even revealing what seems to be a number plate, I hope to be able to get a clear enough image to identify.|||
