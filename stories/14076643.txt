Description: 

DevOps has provided plenty of lessons for how to speed up the pace of delivery and frequency of deployments. But delivery and deployment only covers one part of the day-to-day life for developers in large enterprises. What about what happens after deployment? In most cases, increasing the pace of delivery and frequency of deployment just increases the operational support load, work interrupts, and context switching that has always cut deeply into a development team’s time. 

 

This talk will focus on the successful design patterns that high-performing, large scale organizations have applied to reduce the operational burden and support costs across their entire organization. Specifically, we’ll look at how they apply DevOps principles to improving the post-deployment lifecycle and how Developers play the key role in reducing the difficultly and cost of operations activity for everyone.|||
