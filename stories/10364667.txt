etsy/statsd comes with a proxy in nodejs, and we are running it on a single server, proxing a statsd cluster via an udp port. But we found that this nodejs proxy is losing packets, up to 30~40% sometimes!

Cpus are idle but packets are being lost. In our case, one api call makes one statsd request, maybe the single udp socket is too busy.

We tried to use on the original nodejs proxy, this enables us to bind multiple udp sockets on a single port, but nodejs(or libuv) has disabled this option, and golang just dosen't have a method .

Therefore, we made it in C.|||
