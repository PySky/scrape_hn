During the developmental stages of design, oftentimes we don’t pay close enough attention to the minute details within since they too can take up a good chunk of time to correct and we usually tend not to prioritize them within our agenda. However, afterwards these minute details tend to cause a great deal of problems during the stages of transforming the design into code (be it an application or a full-fledged product). This ends taking up even more time to correct, than if we initially had dedicated more time during the developmental stages of design and sorted out any minute problems that may have arised.

Please take a look at a short overview of some common problems that have popped up while I was creating the design or when I was checking it.

Add additionally designed screen to show how to have workable scrolling on the page if it is needed.

Always try to demonstrate a different case of appearance the UI element as much as possible. It will be very useful in  reducing  the time of development.

Do take into account the area designated for predictive text within  the keyboard!

Always keep clear delimitation for such kind of UI component. Place them into separate rows.

The message has to point to the solution of the problem, and can be placed directly near the input field.

All and all, I want to conclude that it’s worth to keep in mind that the mode detailed your design will be, then the better it will mold into the final product.
