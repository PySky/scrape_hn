Microsoft's own antivirus software made Windows 7, 8.1, RT and 10 computers, as well as Windows Server 2016 more vulnerable. 

 

Microsoft has just [released](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/4022344.aspx>) an out-of-band security update to patch the [crazy bad bug](<http://thehackernews.com/2017/05/windows-rce-exploit.html>) discovered by a pair of Google Project Zero researchers over the weekend. 

 

Security researchers Tavis Ormandy announced on Twitter during the weekend that he and another Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich discovered_ \"the worst Windows remote code [execution vulnerability] in recent memory.\"_ 

 

Natalie Silvanovich also published a [proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code](<https://twitter.com/natashenka/status/861748397409058816>) that fits in a single tweet. 

 

The [reported RCE vulnerability](<http://thehackernews.com/2017/05/windows-rce-exploit.html>), according to the duo, could work against default installations with _\"wormable\" _ability \u2013 capability to replicate itself on an infected computer and then spread to other PCs automatically. 

 

According to an [advisory](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/4022344.aspx>) released by Microsoft, the remotely exploitable security flaw (CVE-2017-0290) exists in **Microsoft Malware Protection Engine **(MMPE) \u2013 the company's own antivirus engine that could be used to fully compromise Windows PCs without any user interaction. 

 





### List of Affected Anti-Malware Software



 

Eventually, every anti-malware software that ship with the Microsoft's Malware Protection Engine are vulnerable to this flaw. The affected software includes: 

 





 * Windows Defender

 * Windows Intune Endpoint Protection

 * Microsoft Security Essentials

 * Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection

 * Microsoft Forefront Security for SharePoint

 * Microsoft Endpoint Protection

 * Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Protection

 

Microsoft's Defender security software comes enabled by default on Windows 7, 8.1, RT 8.1, and Windows 10, as well as Windows Server 2016. All are at risk of full remote system compromise. 

 





### Remote Code Execution Flaw in Microsoft's Malware Protection Engine



 

The flaw resides in the way the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scan files. It is possible for an attacker to craft a malicious file that could lead to memory corruption on targeted systems. 

 

Researchers have labeled the flaw as a \"_type confusion_\" vulnerability that exists in NScript, a \"component of mpengine that evaluates any filesystem or network activity that looks like JavaScript,\" which fails to validate JavaScript inputs. 





> \"To be clear, this is an unsandboxed and highly privileged JavaScript interpreter that is used to evaluate untrusted code, by default on all modern Windows systems. This is as surprising as it sounds,\" Google security researchers explained in a [bug report](<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1252&desc=5>) posted on the Chromium forum.



Since antivirus programs have real-time scanning functionality enabled by default that automatically scans files when they are created, opened, copied or downloaded, the exploit gets triggered as soon as the malicious file is downloaded, infecting the target computer. 

 

The vulnerability could be exploited by hackers in several ways, like sending emails, luring victims to sites that deliver malicious files, and instant messaging. 





> \"On workstations, attackers can access mpengine by sending emails to users (reading the email or opening attachments is not necessary), visiting links in a web browser, instant messaging and so on,\" researchers explained. 



> \"This level of accessibility is possible because MsMpEng uses a filesystem minifilter to intercept and inspect all system filesystem activity, so writing controlled contents to anywhere on disk (e.g. caches, temporary internet files, downloads (even unconfirmed downloads), attachments, etc.) is enough to access functionality in mpengine.\"



The injected malicious payload runs with elevated LocalSystem level privileges that would allow hackers to gain full control of the target system, and perform malicious tasks like installing spyware, stealing sensitive files, and login credentials, and much more. 

 

Microsoft responded to the issue very quickly and comes up with a patch within just 3 days, which is very impressive. The patch is now available via Windows Update for Windows 7, 8.1, RT and 10. 

 

The vulnerable version of Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MMPE) is 1.1.13701.0, and the patched version is 1.1.13704.0. 

 

By default, Windows PCs automatically install the latest definitions and updates for the engine. So, your system will install the emergency update automatically within 1-2 days, but you can also get it installed immediately by pressing 'Check Update' button in your settings.

Details: 

MsMpEng is the Malware Protection service that is enabled by default on Windows 8, 8.1, 10, Windows Server 2012, and so on. Additionally, Microsoft Security Essentials, System Centre Endpoint Protection and various other Microsoft security products share the same core engine. MsMpEng runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM without sandboxing, and is remotely accessible without authentication via various Windows services, including Exchange, IIS, and so on. 



On workstations, attackers can access mpengine by sending emails to users (reading the email or opening attachments is not necessary), visiting links in a web browser, instant messaging and so on. This level of accessibility is possible because MsMpEng uses a filesystem minifilter to intercept and inspect all system filesystem activity, so writing controlled contents to anywhere on disk (e.g. caches, temporary internet files, downloads (even unconfirmed downloads), attachments, etc) is enough to access functionality in mpengine. MIME types and file extensions are not relevant to this vulnerability, as MsMpEng uses it's own content identification system. 



Vulnerabilities in MsMpEng are among the most severe possible in Windows, due to the privilege, accessibility, and ubiquity of the service. 



The core component of MsMpEng responsible for scanning and analysis is called mpengine. Mpengine is a vast and complex attack surface, comprising of handlers for dozens of esoteric archive formats, executable packers and cryptors, full system emulators and interpreters for various architectures and languages, and so on. All of this code is accessible to remote attackers. 



NScript is the component of mpengine that evaluates any filesystem or network activity that looks like JavaScript. To be clear, this is an unsandboxed and highly privileged JavaScript interpreter that is used to evaluate untrusted code, by default on all modern Windows systems. This is as surprising as it sounds. 



We have written a tool to access NScript via a command shell for testing, allowing us to explore and evaluate it: 



$ mpscript 

main(): Please wait, initializing engine... 

main(): Ready, type javascript (history available, use arrow keys) 

> 6 * 9 

JavaScriptLog(): 54 

> document. location. the hostname 

JavaScriptLog(): www.myserver.com 

> \"abcd\" + String. fromCharCode(0x3f) 

JavaScriptLog(): abcd? 

> /[y]e+(s|S)/. exec(\"yes\")[0] // C++ regex engine running unsandboxed as SYSTEM on attacker controlled REGEX? 

JavaScriptLog(): yes 

> for (i in document) log(i) 

JavaScriptLog(): appendChild 

JavaScriptLog(): attributes 

JavaScriptLog(): childNodes 

JavaScriptLog(): createElement 

JavaScriptLog(): createTextNode 

JavaScriptLog(): getElementById 

JavaScriptLog(): getElementsByTagName 

JavaScriptLog(): write 

JavaScriptLog(): writeln 

JavaScriptLog(): referrer 

JavaScriptLog(): cookie 

JavaScriptLog(): location 

JavaScriptLog(): undefined 

> the window. ScriptEngineBuildVersion 

JavaScriptLog(): [object Function] 

> the window. ScriptEngineBuildVersion() 

JavaScriptLog(): 8831 



We have discovered that the function JsDelegateObject_Error::toString() reads the \"message\" property from the this object, but fails to validate the type of the property before passing it to JsRuntimeState::triggerShortStrEvent(). 



In pseudocode, the code does something like this: 



prophash = JsObject::genPropHash(\"message\", 0); 

RuntimeState::getThisPtr(&thisptr) 



if (JsObject::get(thisptr, prophash, &message)) { 

JsRuntimeState::triggerShortStrEvent(\"error_tostring\", message); 

} 





The method assumes that the message is a string, but it can be of any type, so this type of confusion allows an attacker to pass arbitrary other objects. JsRuntimeState::triggerShortStrEvent() calls JsString::numBytes() on the passed object, which will invoke a method from the object's vtable. 



int __fastcall JsString::numBytes(JsString this) 

{ 

if ( this == 0x12 ) 

return 0; 

if ( (this & 0x12) == 0x12 ) 

return this >> 5; 

return this->vtbl->GetLength(this); 

} 



Nscript supports the \"short\" strings, withlength and values contained in the handle and \"long\" strings with out-of-line memory. If the string is \"long\" (or appears to be due to type confusion), a vtable call is made to retrieve the length. 



Integer handles are represented as four-byte values with the final bit set to one by the engine. The integer itself is left shifted by one bit, and the final bit set to create the handle. Handles to most objects, including strings, are represented as the value of the pointer to the object with no modification. Therefore, this type confusion allows an integer to be specified and treated as pointer (though the bits need to shifted to get the correct value in the handle, and only the odd pointer values are possible). 



To reproduce this vulnerability, download the attached testcase. The debugging session below was captured after visiting a website that did this:

Before executing the JavaScript, mpengine uses a number of heuristics to decide if evaluation is necessary. One such heuristic estimates file entropy before deciding whether to evaluate any javascript, but we've found that appending some complex comments is enough to trigger this. 



The attached proof of concept demonstrates this, but please be aware that downloading it will immediately crash MsMpEng in it's default configuration and possibly destabilize your system. Extra care should be taken sharing this report with other Windows users via the Exchange, or web services based on IIS, and so on. 



As mpengine will unpack arbitrarily deeply nested archives and supports many obscure and esoteric archive formats (such as Amiga ZOO and MagicISO UIF), there is no practical way to identify an exploit at the network level, and administrators should patch as soon as is practically possible. 



We have verified that on Windows 10, adding a blanket exception for C:\\ is enough to prevent automatic scanning of filesystem activity (you can still initiate manual scans, but it seems prudent to do so on trusted files only, making the action pointless). 



This vulnerability was discovered by Natalie Silvanovich and Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero.

Worse, MsMpEng is accessible remotely via a number of critical, ubiquitous Windows services, including Exchange and the IIS web server. With one email\u2014one that would not have to be read by the user\u2014an attacker could execute code remotely on a vulnerable computer running MsMpEng.



\u201cVulnerabilities in MsMpEng are among the most severe possible in Windows, due to the privilege, accessibility, and ubiquity of the service,\u201d Google said in its [bug report](<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1252&desc=5>).



Updates will be automatically pushed to the engine within 48 hours, Microsoft said last night. Admins should verify that version 1.1.13704.0 of the engine is running. Microsoft listed a number of affected products in its advisory, all of them rated critical, including Forefront Endpoint Protection, System Center Endpoint Protection, Security Essentials, Defender for Windows 7, 8.1, RT 8.1, 10 and Windows Server 2016.



\u201cThe update addresses a vulnerability that could allow remote code execution if the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans a specially crafted file,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system.\u201d

Ormandy and Silvanovich warned via Twitter on Saturday that they had just found a severe Windows vulnerability without sharing much more information, other than it was wormable. It was also thought to be unlikely that Microsoft would be able to turn around a patch so quickly, especially given that today is Patch Tuesday.



Attackers can use a crafted file to access the mpengine component which scans and analyzes files. Ormandy and Silvanovich wrote that an attacker could find success without user interaction with the malicious file because the engine analyzes filesystem activity using a minifilter.



\u201cSo writing controlled contents to anywhere on disk (e.g. caches, temporary internet files, downloads (even unconfirmed downloads), attachments, etc) is enough to access functionality in mpengine,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMIME types and file extensions are not relevant to this vulnerability, as MsMpEng uses it\u2019s own content identification system.\u201d



The researchers said mpengine offers attackers a \u201cvast and complex attack surface,\u201d with numerous components including executable packers an cryptors, system emulators and interpreters that are accessible remotely. Further, mpengine contains a component called NScript that evaluates filesystem and network activity that looks like JavaScript for malicious behavior.



\u201cTo be clear, this is an unsandboxed and highly privileged JavaScript interpreter that is used to evaluate untrusted code, by default on all modern Windows systems,\u201d Ormandy and Silvanovich wrote. \u201cThis is as surprising as it sounds.\u201d



The researchers said they wrote a tool to access NScript via command shell. They found that a particular function in the engine fails to validate message properties from an object before passing it along to a runtime state. An attacker can take advantage of this type of confusion and pass arbitrary objects to runtime, the researchers wrote.



\u201cBefore executing JavaScript, mpengine uses a number of heuristics to decide if evaluation is necessary,\u201d Ormandy and Silvanovich wrote. \u201cOne such heuristic estimates file entropy before deciding whether to evaluate any javascript, but we\u2019ve found that appending some complex comments is enough to trigger this.\u201d



Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through a number of avenues aside from email attachments, including links to sites hosting an exploit sent via email or any instant messenger. The engine will scan the file once it\u2019s opened from the internet, exploiting the vulnerability.



\u201cThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files,\u201d Microsoft said.", "published": "2017-05-09T09:12:00", "cvss": {"score": 0.0, "vector": "NONE"}, "href": "https://threatpost.com/emergency-update-patches-zero-day-in-microsoft-malware-protection-engine/125529/", "cvelist": ["CVE-2017-0290"], "lastseen": "2017-05-09T14:27:11"}], "nessus": [{"id": "SMB_KB4022344.NASL", "type": "nessus", "title": "MS Security Advisory 4022344: Security Update for Microsoft Malware Protection Engine", "description": "The version of Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MMPE) installed on the remote Windows host is prior to 1.1.13701.0.

A flaw in the scanning engine used by various Microsoft anti-malware products could allow attackers to fully compromise a user's system simply by sending them a file as an email attachment or in an instant message, or by enticing them to visit a malicious web page. This vulnerability is especially dangerous for two reasons. In most attacks, users need to be tricked into opening a file or visiting a web page, and even then the malware would generally run at their privilege level unless it's able to escalate. But because the engine runs as SYSTEM, the highest privilege level, it's game over for a compromised system; the attacker has full control. Additionally, because the engine may scan files in the background before the user even sees them, exploitation can occur without the typical prerequisite social engineering tactics. The only good news here is that Microsoft shipped the fix very quickly after being notified, and since it's being delivered as an anti-malware update as opposed to via Windows Update, most users should get the patch without having to take any action.</p><p style=\"min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;\"> </p><p>The fixes released as part of the regular Patch Tuesday updates continue some long-standing trends we've seen from Microsoft, with critical KBs for all supported operating systems addressing remote code execution (RCE) and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

This critical vulnerability allows an attacker to take complete control of the victim's machine by just sending an e-mail attachment. When the malware protection engine scans the attachment the malicious code in the file gets executed, allowing the attacker complete and full access to the computer. The attack can also be carried out by sending the file via an instant message or having the victim download the file from a website. It is absolutely essential that organizations using Microsoft Malware Protection Engine make sure that they are at version Version [1.1.13704.0](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/4022344.aspx>) or later. Users should also check if they are patched for [CVE-2017-0290](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0290>), which was released for the same issue today.



In today\u2019s Patch Tuesday update Microsoft released a total of 57 vulnerability fixes. Highest priority should go to patching 0-day issues which are actively exploited. On top of our list is the Office patch for [CVE-2017-0261](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0261>) which is triggered when a victim opens an Office file containing a malformed graphics image. The file could be delivered via email or any other means. As this is actively exploited in the wild and attackers can take complete control of the victim system, this should be treated with priority.



[CVE-2017-0222](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0222>) also makes the top of the actively attacked list. This vulnerability affects Internet Explorer, and users can be compromised if they visit a malicious website hosted by attackers. This patch gets priority as the vulnerability is currently exploited in the wild and attackers can take complete control of the victim machine.



Next priority goes to the Edge browser vulnerability [CVE-2017-0229](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0229>), which was publicly disclosed before today\u2019s patch Tuesday release. This issue allows attackers to take complete control of victim machine when the user visits malicious websites using Edge.



Next priority goes to three critical SMB remote code execution vulnerabilities ([CVE-2017-0277](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0277>), [CVE-2017-0278](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0278>), [CVE-2017-0279](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0279>)) that affect the Windows server machines as well as desktop clients. The issue exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server handles certain requests. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could gain the ability to execute code on the target. To exploit the vulnerability, in most situations an unauthenticated attacker would send a specially crafted packet to the SMBv1 server.



Also today Microsoft released [updates](<https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/4010323>) to Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 to block sites that are protected with a SHA-1 certificate from loading and to display an invalid certificate warning. This change will only impact SHA-1 certificates that chain to a root in the Microsoft Trusted Root Program where the end-entity certificate or the issuing intermediate uses SHA-1. Enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be impacted.



In summary today\u2019s release fixed 3 actively exploited and 4 publicly disclosed issues including the malware protection engine, Office, IE, Edge and SMB vulnerabilities. Microsoft also deprecated SHA-1 certificates from IE and Edge.", "published": "2017-05-09T18:06:52", "cvss": {"score": 0.0, "vector": "NONE"}, "href": "https://blog.qualys.com/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2017/05/09/microsoft-fixes-malware-protection-engine-and-several-0-day-vulnerabilities", "cvelist": ["CVE-2017-0229", "CVE-2017-0290", "CVE-2017-0279", "CVE-2017-0278", "CVE-2017-0277", "CVE-2017-0222", "CVE-2017-0261"], "lastseen": "2017-05-10T17:44:00"}], "thn": [{"id": "THN:4FA1B8DDABC07B224F8640C77D3D3295", "type": "thn", "title": "Microsoft Issues Patches for Another Four Zero-Day Vulnerabilities", "description": "[![Microsoft Issues Patches for Another Four Zero-Day Vulnerabilities](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vpXxMS5a1OQ/WRLsUKCC4II/AAAAAAAAsiw/8zkd69jstykdsFIkaYYDa9lAVVLKnZO2QCLcB/s1600/windows-zero-day-exploit.png)](<https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vpXxMS5a1OQ/WRLsUKCC4II/AAAAAAAAsiw/8zkd69jstykdsFIkaYYDa9lAVVLKnZO2QCLcB/s1600/windows-zero-day-exploit.png>)



 

As part of this month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released security patches for a total of 55 vulnerabilities across its products, including fixes for four zero-day vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. 

 

Just yesterday, Microsoft released an [emergency out-of-band update](<http://thehackernews.com/2017/05/windows-defender-rce-flaw.html>) separately to patch a remote execution bug ([CVE-2017-0290](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0290>)) in Microsoft's Antivirus Engine that comes enabled by default on Windows 7, 8.1, RT, 10 and Server 2016 operating systems. 

 

The vulnerability, reported by Google Project Zero researchers, could allow an attacker to take over your Windows PC with just an email, which you haven't even opened yet. 

 

**_May 2017 Patch Tuesday_ \u2014** Out of 55 vulnerabilities, 17 have been rated as critical and affect the company's main operating systems, along with other products like Office, Edge, Internet Explorer, and the malware protection engine used in most of the Microsoft's anti-malware products. 

 

Sysadmins all over the world should prioritize the May's Patch Tuesday as it addresses four critical zero-day vulnerabilities, three of which being actively exploited by cyber-espionage groups in targeted attacks over the past few months. 

 





### 3 Zero-Days Were Exploited in the Wild by Russian Cyber-Espionage Group



 

**_First Zero-Day Vulnerability ([CVE-2017-0261](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0261>))_ \u2014** It affects the 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office 2010, 2013 and 2016, and resides in how Office handles Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) image files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the system. 

 

This Office vulnerability could be exploited by tricking victims into opening a file containing a malformed graphics image in an email. The attack also exploits a Windows privilege escalation bug ([CVE-2017-0001](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-013.aspx>)) that the company patched on March 14 to gain full control over the system \u2013 essentially allowing attackers to install spyware and other malware. 

 

According to the [FireEye](<https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/eps-processing-zero-days.html>) researchers, the CVE-2017-0261 flaw has been exploited since late March by an unknown group of financially motivated hackers and by a Russian cyber espionage group called Turla, also known as Snake or Uroburos. 

 

**Second Zero-Day Vulnerability ([CVE-2017-0262](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0262>)) \u2014 **FireEye and [ESET](<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/09/sednit-adds-two-zero-day-exploits-using-trumps-attack-syria-decoy/>) researchers believe that the APT28 hacking group, also known as Fancy Bear, or Pawn Storm, was actively using this EPS-related Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability which leads to remote code execution on opening a malformed file. 

 

**_Third Zero-Day Vulnerability ([CVE-2017-0263](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0263>))_ \u2014 **The third zero-day bug is an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability in all supported versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system. 

 

This vulnerability exists in the way Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code in kernel mode and then install malware, view, change, or delete data, and even create new accounts with full user rights. 

 

Researchers believe that the Russian cyber-espionage group was also actively exploiting this flaw (CVE-2017-0263) along with the second zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-0262). 

 

**_Fourth Zero-Day Vulnerability ([CVE-2017-0222](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0222>))_ \u2014 **Another zero-day vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and resides in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. 

 

Opening a malicious web page can corrupt memory to trigger remote code execution, allowing attackers to take control of an affected system. According to the tech giant, this issue was also exploited in the wild. 

 

**_Patches for Other Critical Vulnerabilities_ \u2014** This month's security updates also fix critical vulnerabilities in both Edge and Internet Explorer (IE) that could lead to remote code execution by tricking victims into visiting malicious websites or viewing specially crafted advertisements inside the browsers. 

 

Besides this, Microsoft also addresses four critical remote code execution bugs ([CVE-2017-0272](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0272>), [CVE-2017-0277](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0277>), [CVE-2017-0278](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0278>), and [CVE-2017-0279](<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0279>)) in Windows SMB network file-sharing protocol, which affects Windows 7 through 10 and Windows Server 2008 through 2016. 

 

These vulnerabilities put Windows PCs and server installations at risk of hacking if they use SMBv1, though there have been no reports of any of these flaws exploited in the wild. 

 

As usual, Adobe Flash Players patches are also included in the security update to address [7 CVE-listed flaws](<https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb17-15.html>) in the Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

 

Windows users are strongly advised to install the latest updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild.

Although I\u2019m still dreaming of the sandy beaches of Cancun, it\u2019s time to get back to reality. Security vulnerabilities never take a holiday and this week is no exception. In addition to our normal Digital Vaccine (DV) package delivered earlier this week, we also issued an out-of-band DV package to address zero-day vulnerabilities for Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) ([CVE-2017-5689](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5689>)) and Windows Defender ([CVE-2017-0290](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0290>)).



The Intel AMT vulnerability is an escalation of privilege vulnerability that allows an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by the affected Intel AMT products. The Windows Defender vulnerability is much scarier because allows a remote attacker to take over a system without any interaction from the system owner. Just the mere execution of Windows Defender scanning an email or instant message from an attacker is enough. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 customers using TippingPoint solutions are protected from these vulnerabilities with the following DV filters:

**Microsoft Update**



This week\u2019s Digital Vaccine (DV) package includes coverage for Microsoft updates released on or before May 9, 2017. Microsoft released patches for 55 new CVEs in Internet Explorer, Edge, Office, Windows, and .NET Framework. A total of 14 of these CVEs are rated Critical while the rest are rated Important in severity. The following table maps Digital Vaccine filters to the Microsoft updates. Filters marked with an (*) shipped prior to this DV package, providing zero-day protection for our customers. You can get more detailed information on this month\u2019s security updates from Dustin Childs\u2019 [May 2017 Security Update Review](<https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2017/5/5/the-may-2017-security-update-review>):
