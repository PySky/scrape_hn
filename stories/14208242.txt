Brilliant Earth has scammed thousands of customers



They claim to:

1) Provide their customers with the exact origin of their diamonds, and

2) Track their diamonds from mine to consumer- making sure no human rights violation takes place.

We’ve proven both of these claims to be false.

Brilliant earth diamonds lack any paperwork tracking their origin to the mine. We followed up on hundreds of Brilliant earth’s “Canadian-origin” diamonds, and according to Brilliant Earth’s suppliers, none of the diamonds are actually certified Canadian.



The Canadian certificate we were given by Brilliant Earth was fake.



Brilliant Earth has NO presence during the mining of their diamonds, has NO idea where their diamonds come from, and has NO way of knowing the age of their diamonds.



The diamonds provided by brilliant earth are totally untraceable and could have easily been mined in a conflict zone.
