After a long time spent anticipating, finally the Samsung is unveiling its Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones today! In spite of the fact, that there’s not much to make out about the Galaxy S8 and S8+, as a bundle of gossipy titbits were streaming-in, as we got nearer to the official launch. What’s more? The most recent one to join them, is the pricing information, revealed by the Vodafone Czech Republic.

Already we’ve gotten notifications from different sources that the cost of these smartphones will be higher than Galaxy S7 family, but marginally unique costs for the distinctive markets. According to the leak, the Galaxy S8 will be priced at 21,977 Czech crowns which is approximately translated to €813. Next to that, the bigger variant S8+’s price will be 24,977 Czech crowns, which is roughly around €925.

Have it in mind that the prices, mentioned in Euros, can be potentially characterized as the average cost of the Galaxy S8, in rest of the Europe. Thus, it is confirmed that, when compared to its predecessors, the Galaxy S8 duo are priced way higher; as we know, the prices of S7 series in Europe last year, were €700 and €800, for Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, respectively.

Now, everyone are interested to perceive, how the customers are going to respond to the new bumped-up prices for the devices. However, we expect that these devices are going to be greeted well, by most of the people.

Odds are that in the United States; where the genuine cost of the device, stays covered-up in the month to month charge in some possible frame, and hence, this higher cost wouldn’t be very much discerned. Yet, it shouldn’t be the same on the worldwide markets, where clients usually pay the full retail cost for a device. Let’s wait and watch!|||

Vodafone Europe already reveals the pricing details of Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8+. both device going to launch officially today in new York and London.
