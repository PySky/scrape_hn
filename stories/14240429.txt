This repository contains a sample showing how WebAssembly ( ) can be used to implement the parsing of DICOM files client-side, i.e. directly by a Web browser. DICOM is the standard file format for medical imaging. The DICOM parser is entirely written in C++ using the industrial-grade DCMTK toolkit.

A live demonstration of this code is available on the Orthanc homepage.

Download the latest version of the WebAssembly toolkit based upon Emscripten.

Obviously, adapt the path of the of the invokation to your own environment.
