Reinventing the bus for the smart city era

In fact, we’re reinventing the entire software stack for running and operating a bus. We believe smarter buses lead to better mobility and cities.

Starting on Tue May 9th and Wed May 10th. With an experimental popup route: CMX1, running a Circulator in the heart of London.

TfL has been the most forward thinking public transport agency in the world. They released open data that gave us the opportunity to build an app to help the people of London. They are now supportive as we mutually think about the future of the bus in the city.

It runs on a fixed route. It uses bus stops. People can hop on and off. However, in time you’re going to see us ‘rethink’ how buses and routes operate and how to make them more efficient and useful in cities.

We’re also introducing a smaller, nimbler vehicle that we believe is necessary in crowded cities.|||
