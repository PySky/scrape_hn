Malfunction is a set of tools for cataloging and comparing malware at a function level. Uses Radare2 internally for finding function locations. Written in Python 3. Currently only works on Linux based systems.

Jeramy Lochner and Matthew Rogers gave a presentation on Malfunction for DerbyCon on 9/25/2015 in Louisville, KY. http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon5/stable08-malfunctions-functions-automated-static-malware-analysis-using-function-level-signatures-matthew-rogers-jeramy-lochner

Using mallearn to add a piece of malware to the database, then use malfucntion to compare another program with it.

mal-get 'gets' the function-level fuzzy hashes from a given binary and is usually used in conjunction with mal-learn or malfunction

mal-learn is used for known malware, or things you want to white-list and learns them to the database

Malfunction generates reports on a unknown binary, based on the signatures in the database.|||
