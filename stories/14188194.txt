While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it.

RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called "Conduit".

Work In Progress: Flask | Go | Elixir + Phoenix | GraphQL / Apollo | Node.js Lambda + DynamoDB | Go + Gin | Rust | Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions | .NET Core | HapiJS | Falcon + GAE | Nim | Scala + Play | Koa.js(Node.js) + knex(SQL) | Slim | Clojure | Spring (w/ Spring Boot) | F# | Symfony | Kotlin + Spring | ASP.NET Core

Or you can view upcoming stacks (WIPs)

Note: All stacks that are a WIP are experimental and incomplete.

Don't expect everything to work perfectly out of the box!

Simply follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo's you want to get up and running.

Yup! We've built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from all the way to the production ready application. Start learning now >>>

Forks, tutorials, workshops, and other resources based on the RealWorld project:

RealWorld would not be possible without the open source community continuously helping push the project forward. In addition, we have a core project team composed of:

Eric is a Software Engineer, UI Designer, and author of many technical books & tutorials. He oversees the project direction, maintenance and organizes the planning and development efforts of the team.

Albert is a Software Engineer, DevOps ninja, and author of many technical books & tutorials. He oversees the project direction, maintenance and organizes the planning and development efforts of the team.

Thinkster creates high quality resources that help Javascript developers succeed. The RealWorld project wouldn't exist without their funding, so please consider investing in a Pro subscription to help support us!

James is a Software Engineer at Square and a contributor to the Django project. He created & maintains the RW Django codebase and continually provides guidance for the RealWorld project itself.

Val Karpov is a Software Engineer at Booster Fuels and is a core contributor to Mongoose. He created & maintains the RealWorld React/Redux codebase.

RealWorld wouldn't be possible without the help of the open source community reviewing codebases, creating new app implementations, and many other tasks that help push this project forward. We especially appreciate the OSS leaders who have helped contribute to RealWorld:

All of the codebases are MIT licensed unless otherwise specified.|||
