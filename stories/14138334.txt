MyBit revolutionizes asset management by enabling the secure administration of ownership via a decentralized, golden source ledger. It effectively removes single point of failure risk, reliance on third-party escrow agents, and much of the friction in traditional systems. MyBitâ€™s design is optimized to increase the accessibility of asset management and investment services by utilizing innovative technology to lower costs. Governed by a profit sharing smart contract, MyBit is the first DApp that truly bridges the gap between physical and digital realms while enabling investors to partake in revenue distributions.
