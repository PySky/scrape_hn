Three weeks have passed since the Nintendo Switch was released, and sales show no sign of slowing down. Numerous early adopters, however, have found themselves all encountering the same problem: The left Joy-Con keeps getting de-synced.

Nintendo's help website initially (and with a straight face) suggested that the issues could have stemmed from something as simple as using the Switch near an aquarium or close to laptops, microwaves, or cellphones that are turned on.

But the company now seems to be subtly acknowledging an error in the design of the left Joy-Con's internals. A senior editor at CNET has reported that Nintendo customer support fixed his faulty Joy-Con in less than one week and appears to have changed its manufacturing process to fix the problem moving forward.

Whether Nintendo will make an announcement conceding that there was a design flaw and offer a replacement program for early adopters remains to be seen. In the meantime, you can either reach out to Nintendo customer support or stay away from aquariums.|||
