Samsung is reportedly planning something pretty special for its next top device.The company revealed the new Galaxy S8 and S8+ flagship smartphones last month to widespread acclaim, with the new devices praised for their powerful hardware and beautiful curved screens.Now, attention has turned to what Samsung has planned for its next launch, with the company set to explore several avenues in developing new and exciting devices.And new reports have claimed that the company is set to reveal a number of devices featuring multiple screens.The news comes from two news outlets from Samsung’s home nation of South Korea, which say the company is well on its way developing “Project Valley”.The first prototype dual-screen devices are set to be revealed later this year, claimed ET News and The Investor , with between 2,000 and 3,000 units being produced.However it seems that the new devices will not reach the high street, but instead will serve as a test point for Samsung in its development of a smartphone with a folding screen.The prototypes will be made of a pair of 5in OLED screens connected by a hinge, allowing the device to unfold to be read like a book.The display would feature nearly zero bezels, providing a wider and fuller view for users.One source told ET News, “Since foldable products draw the most attention in markets recently, it is important to understand demands and ideas regarding new UX through this prototype.”The claims are the latest in a series of rumours that suggest Samsung will soon reveal a device with multiple screens.Earlier this month, reports surrounding a foldable ‘Galaxy X’ smartphone surfaced , with a senior Samsung engineer saying that the company could be set to launch such a device around 2019.The device would look much like current smartphones, but open up like a book to reveal a larger, tablet-sized display.Samsung is not the only company reportedly working on a foldable smartphone, as device manufacturers look to provide users with something remarkable.Last December, it was reported that Google had signed a deal with LG Display to deliver smartphone displays that fold out for a more flexible design than ever.LG Display has reportedly already developed a working prototype panel, described as having a “significantly high” technical level, meaning that the new design could appear soon.Apple and Microsoft have also signalled their interest in the “out-foldable” panels, which use OLED technology for super-detailed displays.|||
