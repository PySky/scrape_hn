Fowler has been a pioneer of various topics around object-oriented technology and agile methods, and written several books including Refactoring, UML Distilled, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and NoSQL Distilled. For the last decade he’s worked at ThoughtWorks, which he considers a “really rather good” system delivery and consulting firm. He writes at martinfowler.com.
