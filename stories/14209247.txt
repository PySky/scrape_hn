Poor man's pomodoro timer - echo \"aplay ring.wav\" | at now + 25 min - The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called 'Pomodori' (from the Italian word for 'tomatoes') separated by short breaks.

You need to prepare a short .wav file (the \"ring.wav\" in the sample command line).  This command will trigger aplay to play ring.wav 25 minutes from now on, which can be used as a poor man's pomodoro timer.
