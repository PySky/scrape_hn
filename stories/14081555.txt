Current recommendation systems help you reach “relevant” information. This information is not necessarily valuable, increasing the breadth of your knowledge or deep enough to create a conversation with others about it. Most importantly, it lacks the context: Why would you want to get this knowledge and what will be the next steps, what are your goals, etc.

Those systems focus on keeping you clicking and sticking and not on whether you — as a person and not a “customer” — are learning something that can change your life or not.

At Knowledge Officer, we are building a platform that gives people relevant, valuable, deep, conversational, and context-aware knowledge.

We choose startups and scaleups as the main target audience because this knowledge can have an exponential impact on what they are doing and will help create more and more knowledge to feed into the loop! Hence the idea of building a learning platform for startups and scaleups that can utilize the strength of this powerful recommendation to help them work faster, smarter and achieve their goals of building the next big things that will change lives.

Not everyone can afford the money or the time to go to conferences meetups, classes, and sessions just to get the right knowledge and get connected with the right people! Not everyone can afford to waste his time reading spam and clickbait either! Nowadays, people expect to get everything online while sitting in their offices and that’s why we want to connect the right and most essential knowledge to the right people who can make use of it straightway.|||
