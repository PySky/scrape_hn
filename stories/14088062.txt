As always, it’s based on active devices interacting with Google Play over the period of a week.

There is nothing to startle the horses at all, with the main takeaway being Nougat (Android version 7.x) doubling its share. Note, however, it’s just an increase of a couple of points, from 2.4% to 4.5% only. But then again, it is only one month of progress.

What may disappoint Google – and is symptomatic of the problem of telcos and handset makers having little interest in updating Android versions – is that the increase for Nougat involves the slightly older version 7.0.

The more recent update, 7.1, remains unchanged – it’s a very small indication of the market’s inability to absorb the latest updates.
