Slow build times are a common problem in C++. The build speed is based on language complexity and code organization. While you may not be able to change C++ language complexity, you can improve code organization. As Herb Sutter said, “Managing dependencies well is an essential part of writing solid code.” The more modular and less interdependent (complex) your code is in general, the less often you will have to recompile everything.
