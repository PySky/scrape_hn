Install windows 10 from USB. Installation of Windows is never much easier than the way I have shown in the video. There is no need to download any kind on tool or software. You just need Windows installation files and a USB to install Windows from USB.

The crazy part is that you can install any version of Windows like Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 or below using this method.

I used CMD to make USB device capable of installing windows then normally boots into USB drive to start Windows 10 installation from USB.

Installation of Windows is very easy if you simply watch this video.

Hope you will enjoy the video and please subscribe to channel to say thanks!
