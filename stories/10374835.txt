It gave high speed servers, really simple deployment and full control over the cloud layout. Shelly was easy to use and developer-centric. You could host a full stack application for just €20 per month.

It was providing following services:

Shelly Cloud started in 2010 as an internal project of Ragnarson, a Ruby consulting company we were working for. We built it to solve the problems we had when deploying apps that we developed for our customers. In 2012 we decided to spin it off into a separate business. During this time we have learned a lot about building products, both from the technical and business perspectives.

We would like to say thank you to our customers, for trust and being with us for years. Building Shelly Cloud wouldn't be possible without you.

We would also thank all people who were a part of our team in the past: Katarzyna Jarmołkowicz, Ignacy Kasperowicz, Dominik Koślin, Dominika Kucharska, Michał Kwiatkowski, Barbara Niewiadomska, Łukasz Piestrzeniewicz, Szymon Szypulski and Stanisław Tuszyński.
