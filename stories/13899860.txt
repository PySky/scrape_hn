Demographics and naïve analysis in exposed vs non-exposed men The repository contained medical records for 691,268 men (Table 1) of whom 17,475 (2.5%) had 5α-RI exposure; of these, 15,634 (89.5%) had no prior diagnosis of ED nor of low libido, nor of PDE I use. Men exposed to 5α-RIs were more likely than unexposed men to have the diagnosis of ED (number needed to harm (NNH) 17.3, ESS 6.4%, p < 0.0001) and of low libido (NNH 73.5, ESS 4.0%, p < 0.0001) and to have been prescribed a PDE I (NNH 10.6, ESS 5.8%, p < 0.0001) (Table 2A). There were 327,437 men 16–42 years old, with 743 exposed either to finasteride >1.25 mg/day or to dutasteride, and 5,582 (1.7%) exposed to finasteride ≤1.25 mg/day. Compared to young men without 5α-RI exposure, those young men with exposure to finasteride ≤1.25 mg/day were more likely to have the adverse effect of ED (NNH 31.1, ESS 6.7%, p < 0.0001) and of low libido (NNH 51.0, ESS 7.2%, p < 0.0001) (Table 2B). Among 16,032 men with prostatic hyperplasia and with an encounter and a diagnosis recorded during 2014 (the last complete year in the dataset), 3,890 (24.3%) had 5α-RI exposure. A. Univariate predictors for all men (N = 691,268): cohorts exposed to 5α-RI drugs compared to unexposed cohort B. Univariate predictors for men <42d (N = 326,694): cohort exposed to low-dose finasteride (≤1.25 mg/day), compared to unexposed cohort New erectile dysfunction and new low libido in men exposed to a 5α-RI Among the 15,634 men with 5α-RI exposure and without prior sexual dysfunction, 699 (4.5%) developed new ED and 210 (1.3%) developed new low libido. Univariable predictors for new erectile dysfunction and new low libido in all men exposed 5α-Reductase inhibitor exposure duration was a significant predictor of new ED (cutpoint >90.5 days of 5α-RI exposure, NNH 29.7, ESS 19.6%, p < 0.0001). Of the 29 significant predictors of new ED, four were more accurate predictors than 5α-RI exposure duration: prostate disease, prostate surgery, number of encounters, and number of encounters after 5α-RI exposure (Table 3A). Of the 15 significant predictors of new low libido, 5α-RI exposure duration was the most accurate predictor (cutpoint >96.5 days of 5α-RI exposure, NNH 76, ESS 24.8%, p < 0.0001) (Table 3A). A.

Univariable risk factors for persistent erectile dysfunctionj in men <42 years old exposed to finasteride 1.25 mg/dayl 34 of 4,284 (0.79%) Multivariable models for new erectile dysfunction and new low libido in all men exposed The best multivariable model predicting new ED had four variables: prostate disease, number of encounters after initial 5α-RI exposure, 5α-RI exposure duration, and age (ESS 33.5%, all p ≤ 0.0001; prospective validity on 6-month holdout sample ESS 30.8%) (Fig. 1A). Among men without prostate disease and with > 11.5 encounters after 5α-RI exposure, the NNH for new ED was 37.7 for longer vs shorter 5α-RI exposure duration (cutpoint >106 days of 5α-RI exposure). The multivariable model predicting new low libido had four attributes: 5α-RI exposure duration, age, NSAID exposure (Y/N), and total number of clinical encounters (ESS 36.6%, all p ≤ 0.003; prospective validity on 6-month holdout sample ESS 34.2%) (Fig. 1B). Classification tree analyses for erectile dysfunction and low libido in men prescribed 5α-reductase inhibitors. The two classification trees shown are those that predicted, respectively, new erectile dysfunction or new low libido after 5α-RI exposure with greater accuracy than any other possible alternative classification tree given the pool of exposure variables in Table 3 . (A) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new erectile dysfunction had four variables: prostate disease, number of encounters between 5α-RI exposure and onset of impotence, age, and number of days on 5α-RIs. Men with no prostate disease, >11.5 clinical encounters, and >106 days of 5α-RI exposure had a 5.3% rate of new erectile dysfunction. (B) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new low libido had four variables: number of days of 5α-RI exposure, age, use of prescribed NSAIDs, and total number of clinical encounters. Men with >96.5 days of 5α-RI exposure, age ≤73.5 years, and use of NSAIDs had a 3.5% rate of new low libido. New persistent erectile dysfunction in men exposed to a 5α-RI Of the 11,909 men with 5α-RI exposure and without prior sexual dysfunction and who were evaluated for new PED, 167 (1.4%) developed new PED lasting for ≥90 days after stopping the 5α-RI (median 1,348 days after stopping 5α-RI, interquartile range (IQR) 631.5–2,320.5 days). Of the 530 men with new ED, 167 (31.5%) had new PED. Univariable predictors for new persistent erectile dysfunction in all men exposed 5α-Reductase inhibitor exposure duration was the third most accurate predictor of PED (cutpoint >179.5 days of 5α-RI exposure, NNH 88.6, ESS 20.4%, p < 0.0001). Of the 26 statistically significant predictors of PED, only prostate surgery and prostate disease were more accurate predictors than 5α-RI exposure duration (Table 3B). Multivariable model for new persistent erectile dysfunction in all men exposed The best multivariable model predicting new PED had four variables: prostate disease, 5α-RI exposure duration, age, and NSAID use (ESS 42.4%, all p ≤ 0.002) (Fig. 2A). Among men with no prostate disease, those with longer 5α-RI exposure plus concomitant NSAID exposure had a risk of new PED that was 4.8-fold higher than men with shorter exposure (cutpoint >208.5 days of 5α-RI exposure, NNH = 59.8, all p < 0.002). The two classification trees shown are those that predicted new persistent erectile dysfunction in, respectively, all 5α-RI exposed men or in all 5α-RI exposed men <42 years old with greater accuracy than any other possible alternative classification tree given the pool of exposure variables in Table 3 . (A) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new persistent erectile dysfunction in all men had four variables: prostate disease, number of days on 5α-RIs, age, and use of prescribed NSAIDs. Men with no prostate disease, >208.5 days on 5α-RIs, and use of prescribed NSAIDs had a 2.1% rate of new persistent erectile dysfunction. The median duration of new persistent erectile dysfunction was 1,348 days. (B) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new persistent erectile dysfunction in finasteride exposed men <42 years old had one variable: number of days on finasteride. Men with >205 days on finasteride had a 1.16% rate of new persistent erectile dysfunction. The median duration of new persistent erectile dysfunction was 1,534 days. New persistent erectile dysfunction in men 16–42 years old and exposed only to finasteride ≤1.25 mg/day Of 4,284 young men exposed to finasteride ≤1.25 mg/day, and without prior sexual dysfunction and who were evaluated for new PED, 34 (0.79%) developed PED (median 1,534 days after stopping 5α-RI, IQR 651–2,351 days). Of 103 young men with new ED, 34 (33%) had new PED. Univariable predictors for new persistent erectile dysfunction in young men exposed to finasteride ≤1.25 Of the nine significant predictors of new PED in young men, duration of finasteride exposure was the most accurate predictor (cutpoint >205 days of finasteride exposure, NNH 108.2, ESS 28.1%, p < 0.004) (Table 3C). Multivariable model for new persistent erectile dysfunction in young men exposed to finasteride ≤1.25 The best multivariable model predicting new PED had one variable: duration of finasteride exposure. Compared to young men with shorter exposure, those young men with longer 5α-RI exposure had a 4.9-fold higher risk (cutpoint >205 days of finasteride exposure, NNH 108.2, ESS 28.1%, p < 0.004) (Fig. 2B).|||

Importance Case reports describe persistent erectile dysfunction (PED) associated with exposure to 5α-reductase inhibitors (5α-RIs). Clinical trial reports and the manufacturers’ full prescribing information (FPI) for finasteride and dutasteride state that risk of sexual adverse effects is not increased by longer duration of 5α-RI exposure and that sexual adverse effects of 5α-RIs resolve in men who discontinue exposure. Objective Our chief objective was to assess whether longer duration of 5α-RI exposure increases risk of PED, independent of age and other known risk factors. Men with shorter 5α-RI exposure served as a comparison control group for those with longer exposure. Design We used a single-group study design and classification tree analysis (CTA) to model PED (lasting ≥90 days after stopping 5α-RI). Covariates included subject attributes, diseases, and drug exposures associated with sexual dysfunction. Setting Our data source was the electronic medical record data repository for Northwestern Medicine. Subjects The analysis cohorts comprised all men exposed to finasteride or dutasteride or combination products containing one of these drugs, and the subgroup of men 16–42 years old and exposed to finasteride ≤1.25 mg/day. Main outcome and measures Our main outcome measure was diagnosis of PED beginning after first 5α-RI exposure, continuing for at least 90 days after stopping 5α-RI, and with contemporaneous treatment with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5I). Other outcome measures were erectile dysfunction (ED) and low libido. PED was determined by manual review of medical narratives for all subjects with ED. Risk of an adverse effect was expressed as number needed to harm (NNH). Results Among men with 5α-RI exposure, 167 of 11,909 (1.4%) developed PED (persistence median 1,348 days after stopping 5α-RI, interquartile range (IQR) 631.5–2320.5 days); the multivariable model predicting PED had four variables: prostate disease, duration of 5α-RI exposure, age, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Of 530 men with new ED, 167 (31.5%) had new PED. Men without prostate disease who combined NSAID use with >208.5 days of 5α-RI exposure had 4.8-fold higher risk of PED than men with shorter exposure (NNH 59.8, all p < 0.002). Among men 16–42 years old and exposed to finasteride ≤1.25 mg/day, 34 of 4,284 (0.8%) developed PED (persistence median 1,534 days, IQR 651–2,351 days); the multivariable model predicting PED had one variable: duration of 5α-RI exposure. Of 103 young men with new ED, 34 (33%) had new PED. Young men with >205 days of finasteride exposure had 4.9-fold higher risk of PED (NNH 108.2, p < 0.004) than men with shorter exposure. Conclusion and relevance Risk of PED was higher in men with longer exposure to 5α-RIs. Among young men, longer exposure to finasteride posed a greater risk of PED than all other assessed risk factors.
