Brief: In this 30 minutes webinar I’ll give you an introduction into A/B testing. What is A/B testing? Why is it needed? The 5+1 rules of A/B testing. How to set it up? How to evaluate? Some A/B testing pitfalls to avoid. With case studies and with my personal best practices.

It’s for you if you are: a business/marketing professional running an online business (startup, ecommerce, etc). Or an aspiring data analyst/scientist.

The webinar is fully free. I’m doing it, because talking about data is a passion/hobby for me. Sign up to get the link!
