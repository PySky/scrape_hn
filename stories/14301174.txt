The test loads below can be used to verify the correctness of the program. They break down into two groups. The “trigger” group is concerned with checking to see if exceeding various limits trigger an alert and if appropriate flight envelopes are used when they should be. The “verify” group is concerned with checking the validity of the numbers produced by the program and verifying that the results match the old DOS program for the same aircraft, position configuration, and load. You can bring up any test load below by clicking on its button. Test loads may include a yellow box with text explaining the load. The box can be removed by clicking the X in its upper corner.|||
