The base platform contains control nodes that manage the cluster and any number of agent nodes. Containers automatically register themselves into DNS so that other services can locate them.

The control nodes manage a single datacenter. Each control node runs Consul for service discovery, Mesos and Kubernetes leaders for resource scheduling and Mesos frameworks like Marathon.

The Consul Ansible role will automatically bootstrap and join multiple Consul nodes. The Mesos role will provision highly-availabile Mesos and ZooKeeper environments when more than one node is provisioned.

Agent nodes launch containers and other Mesos- or Kubernetes-based workloads.

Edge nodes are responsible for proxying external traffic into services running in the cluster.

All development is done on the branch. Tested, stable versions are identified via git tags. To get started, you can clone or fork this repo:

To use a stable version, use to list the stable versions:

A Vagrantfile is provided that provisions everything on a few VMs. To run, first ensure that your system has at least 2GB of RAM free, then just:

The only requirements for running Mantl are working installations of Terraform and Ansible (or Vagrant, if you're deploying to VMs). See the "Development" sections for requirements for developing Mantl.

Please refer to the Getting Started Guide, which covers cloud deployments.

All documentation is located at http://docs.mantl.io.

Note: The most up-to-date list of Mesos frameworks that are known to work with Mantl is always in the mantl-universe repo.

Please see milestones for more details on the roadmap.

If you're interested in contributing to the project, install Terraform and the Python modules listed in and follow the Getting Started instructions. To build the docs, enter the directory and run . The docs will be output to .

Good issues to start with are marked with the low hanging fruit tag.

If you encounter any issues, please open a Github Issue against the project. We review issues daily.

We also have a gitter chat room. Drop by and ask any questions you might have. We'd be happy to walk you through your first deployment.
