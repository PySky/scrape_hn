Do you ever remember a time where you were in a store contemplating to purchase something and not having a smartphone in hand to research the competition? I sure don’t. Our smartphones are so closely integrated into our daily lives, it’s hard to imagine a time when we didn’t use them. And yes, as a marketer, you want to be a part of a micro-moment.

Google defines it best as: “Micro-moments occur when people reflexively turn to a device—increasingly a smartphone—to act on a need to learn something, do something, discover something, watch something, or buy something. They are intent-rich moments when decisions are made and preferences shaped.”

Our instant --give it to me now, generation has made us fickle consumers. Our hands hold a computer that gives us access to anything in an instant and we expect that in return. So, what can you do to ensure that your customer journey includes micro-moments?

If you still haven’t jumped on the micro-moment bandwagon, consider these statistics 82% of smartphone users consult their phones in store while considering a purchase and just in the past year there has been a 29% increase in mobile conversions.|||
