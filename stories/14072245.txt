When I first started exploring deep learning (DL) in July 2016, many of the papers I read established their baseline performance using the standard AlexNet model. In part, this could be attributed to the several code examples readily available across all major Deep Learning libraries. Despite its significance, I could not find readily available code examples for training AlexNet in the Keras framework. Through this project, I am sharing my experience of training AlexNet in three very useful scenarios :-

I have re-used code from a lot of online resources, the two most significant ones being :-

This project is compatible with Python 2.7-3.5 Make sure you have the following libraries installed.

Note : If you have a GPU in your machine, you might want to configure Keras and Theano to utilize its resources. For myself, running the code on a K20 GPU resulted in a 10-12x speedup.
