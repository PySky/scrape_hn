After almost fifteen years I have decided to quit working on IKVM.NET. The decision has been a long time coming. Those of you that saw yesterdayâ€™s Twitter spat, please donâ€™t assume that was the cause. It rather shared an underlying cause. Iâ€™ve slowly been losing faith in .NET. Looking back, I guess this process started with the release of .NET 3.5. On the Java side things donâ€™t look much better. The Java 9 module system reminds me too much of the generics erasure debacle.

I hope someone will fork IKVM.NET and continue working on it. Although, Iâ€™d appreciate it if theyâ€™d pick another name. Iâ€™ve gotten so much criticism for the name over the years, that Iâ€™d like to hang on to it ðŸ˜Š

Iâ€™d like to thank the following people for helping me make this journey or making the journey so much fun: Brian Goetz, Chris Brumme, Chris Laffra, Dawid Weiss, Erik Meijer, Jb Evain, John Rose, Mads Torgersen, Mark Reinhold, Volker Berlin, Wayne Kovsky, The GNU Classpath Community, The Mono Community.

And I want to especially thank my friend Miguel de Icaza for his guidance, support, inspiration and tireless efforts to promote IKVM.

Thank you all and goodbye.|||
