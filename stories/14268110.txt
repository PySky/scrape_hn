Four Chinese women, including a Northeastern student, were arrested today on charges that one of them took a US college-entry exam for the others, the US Attorney's office in Boston reports.

According to the feds, Yue Wang, 25, a student at the Hult International Business School in Cambridge took the Test of English as a Foreign Language for Shikun Zhang, 24, Leyi Huang, 21, and Xiaomeng Cheng, 21 - and did well enough on it to help them get into Northeastern, Penn State and Arizona State University respectively.

And that just will not do, acting US Attorney William Weinreb said in a statement:

Illegal schemes to circumvent the TOEFL exam jeopardize both academic integrity and our countryâ€™s student visa program. The TOEFL exam ensures that international students have adequate English language skills to succeed in higher education programs in the United States. It also helps maintain the security of our borders and immigration system. By effectively purchasing passing scores, they violated the rules and regulations of the exam, taking spots at US colleges and universities that could have gone to others.

All four women were in the US on student visas. They now face up to five years in federal prison and fines of up to $250,000, followed by deportation, if convicted on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States.|||
