A member of staff at games company Valve surprised his fiancée with a VR proposal which saw the engagement ring comes towards her.

Chandler Murch, made the out-of-the-box lurch at Valve’s Washington headquarters, using the HTC Vive headset which both Valve and technology maker have been jointly working on since March.

Tortorice described the proposal, which doubles as a unique PR stunt for Valve: “So there I was, typical day...on a sunken ship deck; fixing robots; painting three-dimensional fire; walking through the Alps; and then suddenly, a virtual engagement ring started floating my way. Chandler told me to grab it.

“Then he told me to take off my headset, and there he really was, on one knee, with a real ring. It wasn't imaginary anymore.”

She concluded: “But I didn't say yes. I said, ‘OF COURSE I WILL MARRY YOU!’ Thank you for such a hilarious and fun surprise. I love you and I can't wait for the life ahead of us.”

The Vive will be released for sale at the end of 2015 for any would-be husband’s keen to emulate the proposal.|||
