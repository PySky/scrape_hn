Notepad, thoughts out loud, learning in public, misunderstandings, mistakes. undiluted opinions. I'm Mike Hadlow, an itinerant developer. I live (and try to work in) Brighton on the south coast of England. Please don't mistake me for an expert in anything. I love technology and programming, but make no claims to be any good at it.
