Inspiration to start a blog post occurs at the oddest moments. After winding down work, I started browsing the Amazon Kindle store for The Martian. I scrolled down a bit on the search result and saw this:

Interesting, that’s not the novel written by Andy Weir, right? After clicking through, I found other books that did the same thing — to provide a summary and analysis of the novel itself.

Clicking through the author page of BookSense, it looks like they do dozens of these, and all seem to sell fairly well above the 40,000 rank on the Kindle Store at $2.99 a copy. Based on my estimation, anyone who gets a ranking of above 40,000 is getting at least 5 downloads a day, which equals to a decent side and relatively passive income with enough books published.

At first, the reviews seem a bit odd. Who would buy these? Likely not students, since books like these aren’t necessarily assigned reading, right?

It turns out that some readers may belong to book clubs, or they’re just thirsty for some more substantive analysis of the book that isn’t available anywhere else (and some students for assigned reading). Check out the reviews yourself!

Is this bad? Are these guys doing something dirty in that they’re riding the coattails of a successful work? That was my first reaction, but on the other hand they are providing a truly original work in the analysis provided that it’s good.

I suppose this is no different from Cliff’s Notes, or SparkNotes, though it seems the market is wide open on the Kindle Store for anyone to provide their analysis and summary of substantive work. Who knew?

Alright, time to pull the trigger on the real The Martian book.|||
