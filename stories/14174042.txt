Now let’s get down to business.

Firstly, I would like to point out the differences between cryptocurrency and the traditional investment vehicles.

But even before that, it is essential to understand what is an asset or a commodity.

I argue, that any asset which does not serve a short-term, immediate, purpose, is an instrument of transporting risk between 2 or more interested parties.

Or, if you like, an investment vehicle.

As you might know, public companies and governments all publish annual, quarterly and other periodic and even-driven reports.

This is merely an obligation by law, however, using creative accounting and selective financial statements, those reports are often abused to manipulate public opinion.

The principle is the same, in both cases, an entity is offering to the public to take a stake in their risk, for a possible chance of enjoying their success, using staking (stocks, bonds) or revenue share (dividends).

In Bitcoin, as well as in other cryptocurrencies, in case you buy them in their raw, spot form, the risk is still there, not less, and even more than with traditional assets, however the party which is interested in you purchasing this risk is not.

Additionally, in the vast majority of the cases, all the technology is open sourced for you to check and see how it really works, not how someone else wants you to see it.

And finally, those who cannot do, teach, nothing said in this article is actually part of any bible.

At the end of the day(or the decade), you cannot argue with results.
