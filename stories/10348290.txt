Control robots with 3D vision. Fly drones with heads-up displays. Build 3D printers. Operate a remote weather station. Blanket a city in wireless beacons. The possibilities are endless.

All your favorite robot-friendly, open-source platforms are supported: Ubuntu Linux, ROS, FreeRTOS, you name it! And with an FPGA, the entire board is reconfigurable...via software! So not only can you add and customize your own I/O, hardware accelerators, and "soft" microcontrollers, but upgrading hardware in the field is as easy as pushing out a software update. Now that's what we call the Internet of Things...

Why not use a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBoard or Arduino? We're so glad you asked... If you are running Linux, hooking up a bunch of I/O, and need your system to be wireless, snickerdoodle is for you.

Here's some stuff you can do with snickerdoodle you simply can't do with other low-cost platforms:

Simply put: if you're SERIOUS about doing anything that involves robots, drones, computer vision, or automation, you NEED snickerdoodle.
