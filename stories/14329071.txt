Web front end to display the content of multiple Docker registries

It's possible to enable a caching functionality to keep the frontend fast even when viewing thousands of repos and tags. By default it's disabled as there is no need for small registries. To enable it set a value for the cache timeout in seconds.

The frontend supports various kinds of storages to persists the configuration. The following options are currently implemented:

Set the "file_path" value to ":memory:" to use an in-memory database.

If you'd like to use another storage feel free to create an issue or open a pull request.|||
