You've spent six long, excruciating years trying to extract joy from your tired relationship with IE8. That's a lifetime of cache-clearing, vm-running despair you'll never get back. March 19, 2015 was your six year anniversary, so we think it's time to cut your losses and start seeing other browsers.

To put it in perspective, six years in internet time is something like 20 cat years, which makes Internet Explorer 8 very old indeed. Also, when IE8 came out, Susan Boyle was cool. Just sayin'.

For whatever reason, Internet Explorer 8 recently increased in browser share... which is a real kick in the pants for your garden-variety webhead. The sooner we all stop supporting it, the sooner we can collectively work on a more awesome interweb.

Join the intervention and stop supporting IE8. It's time for an upgrade.|||

6 damned years. End this madness #breakupwithie8 today
