Fighting the tech-left’s takeover of the internet

We are concerned citizens who have joined together to fight back against the tech-left’s takeover of the internet.Our goal is to educate citizens about how a small handful of leftist super-elites partnered with some of the most powerful corporate lobbies in the world today to take over our means of communication, information, organizing, and mobilizing: the internet.

For years, globalists like George Soros and leftist Silicon Valley corporations led by Google and Facebook have methodically used their wealth, power, and political connections to chip away at your internet freedoms.

In 2015, Soros-funded interests and their leftist Silicon Valley allies mobilized as never before to orchestrate Obama’s federal government grab to control our information platforms.

In a carefully crafted scheme between the tech-left, Silicon Valley, and the Obama administration, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the net transitioned to a government-regulated utility. The move was the first step in handing over the internet to Google, Soros, and their big government allies to control the platforms, content, and information we depend on.

In less than two years they have now pushed even further —  successfully censoring content they don’t like, threatening social networks to silence dissent, and banning viewpoints that challenge their leftist worldview.

Most of us haven’t even noticed. Many of their schemes sound harmless. Others are couched in Orwellian doublespeak, promising “internet freedom” or “openness and transparency.” But their goals are exactly the opposite. And they are not in our interest.
