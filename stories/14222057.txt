They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack

So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see

You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free

You've got a new horizon it's ephemeral style.

A melancholy town where we never smile.

And all I wanna hear is the message beep.

My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get sleep, no

So all you fill the streets it s appealing to see

You won t get out the county, cause you re bad and free

You ve got a new horizon it s ephemeral style.

You won t get out the county, cause you re bad and free

And all I wanna hear is the message beep.|||
