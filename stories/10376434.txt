It is the right of everyone at work to put hopes and goals to get promoted and to be a leader or manager. With time, these hopes and goals turn into expectations. Therefore, employees will expect to be promoted to a leadership or management position based on their work and efforts. The question is: What might happen if things do not go according to employee’s expectations?

One of the lessons I learned in this life is that expectations might be dangerous especially when set very high. The reason behind that gets more clear when things do not go according to our expectations. This will put the person down. The same case for employees if did not get the promotion he/she expected. Then, this employee will lose interest and motivation at work. Unfortunately, this might go beyond that and the employee might sign his/her resignation letter at work. The solution for such issue is simple, just be moderate with your expectations at work and life in general to avoid this bad experience.|||
