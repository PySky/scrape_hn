WHY ARE WE CALLED “Citadel Digital Security?”

A citadel is the core fortified area of a town or city. It may be a fortress, castle, or fortified center. The term is a diminutive of “city” and thus means “little city”, so called because it is a smaller part of the city of which it is the defensive core.he Citadel is the strongest part of the system, sometimes well inside the outer walls and bastions, but often forming part of the outer wall for the sake of economy. It is positioned to be the last line of defense, should the enemy breach the other components of the fortification system. We at Citadel Digital Security strive to provide this same security to your organization|||
