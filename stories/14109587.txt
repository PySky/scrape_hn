A plugin to fill a layer with a map generated from a location (Powered by Google Maps).

With this plugin you can design quickly a map view for a mobile application or a web site. You only need to write some location and the plugin will do the rest!

The plugin is compatible with Sketch 4.

You can write me questions about the plugin on Twitter: @_edev|||
