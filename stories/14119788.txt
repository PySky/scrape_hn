What if LEGO took some inspiration from Pokémon GO? We have created a concept of a mobile augmented-reality game for LEGO®. If done right, we believe it could follow Pokémon GO’s success. And if you work at LEGO we want to pitch it to you :)

Last summer there was a really incredible Pokémon GO craze. Whatever you went people were playing the game and catching Pokémons.

For us, digital designers, it was really interesting to observe such a phenomenon: whole groups of people at Warsaw office district (called humorously “Mordor”) wandering around with noses in their phones, and gathering around Pokéstops on their way to lunch.

Many clients asked us if we could put some Pikachus at their stores or even at bank branches! Someone created a Pokémon GO channel on our company’s Slack to share tips how to catch those little critters.

And then the craze was over. After a while there was not a lot to do in the game and for many players it quickly became boring.

Still the numbers were incredible:

There were many AR — location based games before, but none so successful. What were the reasons behind Pokémon GO’s success?

Without those little monsters, Pokémons, I don’t think the game would be ever so successful.

We asked ourselves a question: can this phenomenon be repeated? To do a successful game like this you will need a really powerful brand. 

And there is no cooler brand in the world than LEGO.

So we brainstormed a little and we came up with a concept of an augmented reality location based game for LEGO.|||
