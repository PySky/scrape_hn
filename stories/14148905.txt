A function that monkey patches React and notifies you in the console when potentially unnecessary re-renders occur. Super helpful for easy perf gainzzzzz.

You can include or exclude components by their displayName with the include and exclude options

I originally read about how Benchling created a mixin to do this on a per component basis (A deep dive into React perf debugging). That is really awesome but also tedious AF, so why not just monkey patch React.|||
