Welcome to my GUI Gallery On these pages you will find many screen shots of various desktop computer Graphical User Interfaces and operating systems. Many different people have had different ideas of how a GUI should work and these screen shots show many of the more popular ones. Screen shots of the Twiggy Mac and Sony Test pre-releases. If you find anything on this site that doesn't work right, or if you have any suggestions please e-mail me! (If you do, please be absolutely sure to put something meaningful in the subject line, and use plain text, otherwise it will get deleted as spam) And be sure to check out my favorite GUI VisiCorpVisi On now with a downloadable hard drive image that you can run under MESS 0.101 or later. Back in in 1983 there was a GUI platform and office package for IBM PCs called Visi On from VisiCorp. Legend has it Bill Gates saw a demo of this running at the 1982 comdex running on an IBM PC. He freaked out because Microsoft didn't have anything like this yet, ran back to Microsoft Headquarters, and had them start work on what, several years later, became Windows. And if you haven't already, don't forget to laugh really hard at Microsoft BOB! And the new Microsoft Bob: Windows 8! (Or cry, if you are forced to use it)|||
