When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we first notify Institutional members of the NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation , then CERT , and finally make a public announcement.

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation , then access instructions are provided to CERT , and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in public fora such as the comp.protocols.time.ntp Usenet news-group, our Bug Tracking system, bugs@ntp.org, or any other mailing-list.

All of the security issues in this release are listed in VU#633849

ENotification of these issues were delivered to our Institutional members on a rolling basis as they were reported and as progress was made.
