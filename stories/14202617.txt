I recently attended a technology conference and was chatting with one of the presenters.

When she is asked to consult, she first has to educate clients on the types of technologies available and the need to remain competitive with apps and functionality delivered via mobile devices.We are all struggling to keep pace with technology and, if we don’t understand the value of mobile applications and the return on investment for a well-conceived, well designed mobile app, we are missing a huge opportunity for our business.|||
