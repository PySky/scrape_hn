I’m in the process of poring through hundreds of research papers for a big new project, and stumbled across one study that was too good not to share.

In late 2016, Tom McLellan, John Caldwell, and Harris Lieberman undertook a massive project: to summarize more than 250 research studies on how caffeine impacts our mental and physical performance. After reading through studies from the past century, they discovered conclusively that caffeine enhances our mental and physical performance in pretty much every measurable way.

Note: The caffeine doses recommended below are written in milligrams (mg). For reference, there are about 125mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee, and around 40mg of caffeine in a cup of steeped tea. If your weight is significantly above or below average (75kg, or 165 pounds), you’ll want to adjust for your weight. Here’s a handy key that will let you decode the dose of caffeine that will work best for you, depending on your weight: 200mg = consume 2.5mg of caffeine/kg of your body weight or 1.13mg/lb

Caffeine is not without its side effects—it will absolutely cause your energy levels to dip later in the day, and can lead to anxiety and bloating in some people. But for most, the benefits greatly outweigh the costs.

If you’re looking to boost your mental or physical performance, caffeine will certainly do the trick.|||
