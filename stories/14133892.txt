CHOP spinout and realLIST honoree Bainbridge Health just raised a $1.3 million seed round to keep building out its software platform, which is geared at managing infusion pumps. See the SEC filing here.

“The additional funding provides us with resources to significantly expand the scope and functionality of our technology platform, continue to deliver on our implementation pipeline and up the ante on our sales efforts,” said CEO Joseph Kaupp.

We have yet to hear back from Bainbridge Health about participating investors but will update when we do.

Patrick FitzGerald, CHOP’s VP of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, is on Bainbridge’s board, according to the SEC filing.

The startup is currently at six full time employees and is based out of MakeOffices in Center City. So far, it has managed to deploy its health IT platform at two pediatric and eight adult sites (the names of the centers were not disclosed) with plans to roll the system out to half a dozen more over the next few months.

Cofounder Sean O’Neill resigned from his role as Medication Safety Officer at CHOP back in January to join Bainbridge Health full time. He shared thoughts on going from employee to entrepreneur in this blog post.|||
