The initiative will help IT organizations change the way they approach software product delivery with a collective approach known as ScrumOps.

“Transforming into a next-generation, agile IT organization may be easier than many people think,” said Dave West, CEO, Scrum.org. “Scrum empowers teams and provides a lightweight framework for getting work done and DevOps provides the automation, systems thinking and lean practices to deliver and support the work. By bringing the Scrum and DevOps communities and ideas together across the IT organization, we end up with a solution that enables IT teams to understand user needs, build, deploy and secure those systems, manage them over time and keep improving.”

“When we bring the practices and ideologies of Scrum and DevOps together, we can truly shape the end-to-end IT organization,” said Jayne Groll, CEO, DevOps Institute. “This new model shows how business, development, delivery, security and operations fit together to support continuous value in a governed way.”

In addition to the session, Scrum.org and the DevOps Institute have agreed to collaborate on ongoing content, training and resources over the coming months. Read more from Scrum.org and the DevOps Institute.
