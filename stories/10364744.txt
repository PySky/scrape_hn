Sitting in the Tableau Asia Pacific headquarters, we interviewed JY Pook, the vice president, Asia Pacific for Tableau, a NYSE listed data analytics software company. We start from JY’s early career in data to his current role in Tableau. In the conversation, we discussed Tableau’s footprint in Asia, and how Tableau has helped companies such as Hotel Quickly and Metro (a retailer in Asia) to extract insights from their data quickly and translate them into effective business outcomes. Finally, JY Pook offered his observations and advice on best practices in the data analytics space.

Here are the interesting show notes and links to the discussion (with timestamps included):
