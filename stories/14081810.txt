This paper is an introduction to Abstract Stone Duality, in particular its philosophical methodology and the underlying ideas from category theory and Stone duality. An abridged version will appear in Foundational Theories of Classical and Constructive Mathematics, edited by Giovanni Sommaruga and published by Springer-Verlag (BibTeX). Foundations should be designed for the needs of mathematics and not vice versa. We propose a general technique for doing this that exploits mathematical results in categorical logic and the duality between algebra and geometry. This paper is a survey of the application of this technique to devising a revolutionary re-axiomatisation of general topology called Abstract Stone Duality. The Sierpinski space plays a key role as the classifier for both open and closed subspaces. ASD is inherently computable, and has a very strong duality between open and closed concepts. It provides a purely recursive theory of elementary real analysis in which, unlike in previous approaches, the real closed interval [0,1] in ASD is compact.
