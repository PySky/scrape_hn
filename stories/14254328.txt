Komponents is a Swift framework for building component-oriented interfaces.

 Because it's unfair to need javascript to enjoy Components !

New to components? Fear not! Facebook's React guide is a gold mine of information to get you started :)

The easiest way to get started and feel the power of Komponents is to take a look at the example project and play around !

For an even better experience, we strongly recommend enabling Hot reload

You can learn how, like React, Komponents tries to be smart about what it rerenders when the state changes in Patching section.

You can find more detailed information and guides in the Wiki

Komponents can be installed Manually, via Carthage, Cocoapods or Swift Package Manager.
