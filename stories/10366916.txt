I've wanted a standing desk for a while and after reading this blog post I figured why not?

Unfortunately you can't get the Viktor shelf anymore, all the links were US centric and I wanted a larger desk area so I've modified and converted it for people in the UK who need more space.

Almost professional pictures of the really easy process!

I'd definitely suggest putting the LACK coffee table on your desk to figure out the correct height for the keyboard/mouse shelf, using the ergonomic image from here.

So far, I'm really enjoying my new standing setup!|||
