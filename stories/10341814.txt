Former intelligence contractor and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden told the BBC's Panorama last night that the UK intelligence centre GCHQ has the power to hack phones without their owners’ knowledge.

He told the programme that smartphone users are able to do "very little" to prevent security services having "total control" over their devices.

The set of tools is, according to Snowden, called “Smurf Suite” and there are a number of functions:

GCHQ is, for almost [all] intents and purposes, a subsidiary of the NSA. They provide technology, they provide tasking and direction as to what they should go after. And in exchange GCHQ provides access to communications that are collected in the UK.

A spokesperson for the UK government told the BBC that it does not comment on intelligence matters but that its spying work is executed within a “strict legal and policy framework”.

Snowden also told the programme, his first interview with the BBC, that he would be prepared to accept jail time in the US in order to return home.

On the same programme, former NSA boss Michael Hayden told the BBC:

Somewhat ironically, the Panorama interview is not available to watch in the US.
