“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”

Every October, Americans come together to show their support against breast cancer. Pink ribbons are out, 5K races abound and even football players don hot pink accents on their uniforms. Most all of us have been affected by the heartbreaking disease in some way, whether it’s someone you care about or you’ve gone through it personally.

While we applaud the efforts in searching for a cure, true awareness includes a focus on prevention. What if you could avoid breast cancer in the first place? There are simple steps you can take to help protect yourself and lower your risk.
