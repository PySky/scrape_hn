Eyeview Digital is leader in ad tech focusing on video marketing technology. “In the Real Time Bidding realm, using a lightning-fast and reliable key value store is a requirement you cannot work around, and for which we turned to DynamoDB. With hundreds of thousands of queries to DynamoDB per second, we have to make sure we are not hitting hot keys, balancing load and optimizing for cost efficiency.” Stated Shahar Cizer Kobrinsky, VP of Architecture and Scale at Eyeview. “Getting early access to DAX allowed us to do just that. Repeated users are now being handled by the DAX cache without making the more expensive (in both latency & cost) call to DynamoDB. We're excited to see this service going GA and we can definitely see its value for many AWS customers as it has been and will continue to be valuable for us.”
