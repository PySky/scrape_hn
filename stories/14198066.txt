Genius exists to reveal the deeper meaning behind music and culture. When we first linked up with Spotify to launch “Behind the Lyrics” on iOS last year, our vision was to serve Genius knowledge exactly where and exactly when you were listening to music, deepening your understanding of these songs and the artists who created them.

Fast-forward to now: every day, millions of Spotify iPhone users the world over are going “Behind the Lyrics” of thousands of songs across every genre, from Kendrick Lamar to Katy Perry—nixing the habit of sticking their phones in their pockets immediately after pressing “Play.”

And starting today, Spotify Android users will be able to join their ranks.

Kick off your experience by checking out the Genius-powered playlists Behind the Lyrics: Hip Hop and Today’s Top Hits on Spotify. Each of the tracks on these playlists have gotten the Genius treatment, with artist revelations, fun facts, and lyrical excerpts playing along with the music. You’ll learn the ABCs of every song, from who inspired its lyrics to what was going on in the studio when it was recorded.

El Paso-based singer/songwriter and R&B standout Khalid is also giving us an exclusive breakdown of his critically acclaimed new album American Teen, going “Behind the Lyrics” of every track.

“Genius’s ‘Behind the Lyrics’ on Spotify is very helpful because it gives you insight on what the artist was thinking about when they created the record. It also lets you think about things you didn’t think of before,” Khalid says. “You listen to a record, and you interpret it your own way. But with this, you can see what the artist felt. ‘You know what? Maybe it doesn’t mean what I thought. Maybe it means this.’ But at the same time, music is universal. Music can mean anything you want.”

“Behind the Lyrics” on Android starts rolling out to users everywhere today.
