The FCC put in place critical broadband privacy protection rules late last year to protect your right to privacy online. Now, some members of Congress are looking to completely erase those rules. Even worse: The method they would use -- passing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to repeal the rules -- would ban the FCC from ever writing similar privacy rules.

And, because of the current legal landscape, the Federal Trade Commission is already barred from policing Internet service providers. So if Congress repeals the rules, there will be no clear federal cop on the beat for the privacy of your Internet connection.

Call your representatives in Congress and tell them to oppose the CRA resolution to repeal the FCC's privacy rules.|||

UPDATE: Unfortunately, Congress has passed the measure to repeal the FCC's privacy rules, and President Donald Trump has said he will sign it into law. Thank you to everyone who spoke out to protect these privacy rules. Because of your action, lawmakers heard how important privacy is to their constituents, and the votes were much closer than originally anticipated.
Records of your online activity reveal a tremendous amount about you. While that kind of data is currently protected by federal rules, some members of Congress are trying to repeal those rules. They want your broadband provider to be able to sell your sensitive Internet activity records to the highest bidder.
