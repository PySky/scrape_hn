Among the changes in an iPhone software update Apple Inc. released this week: a fix aimed at preventing cyberattacks on 911 centers in the U.S.

The vulnerability was exposed in October after an 18-year-old in Arizona allegedly designed code that would cause iPhones to repeatedly dial 911. A link to the code went viral on Twitter, as teenagers began sharing it as a prank.

The incident, which was detailed in a Wall Street Journal article, resulted in thousands of accidental 911 calls, overwhelming operators in at least a dozen states across the U.S.

The 18-year-old accused of writing the code, Meetkumar Desai, was arrested last fall and charged with four felony counts of computer tampering. His lawyer didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday.

The code only triggered 911 calls from iPhones, exploiting a feature in the smartphone’s software that allows users to click on a phone number and immediately initiate a call. Apple AAPL, -0.41%   says the update supersedes that capability and now requires users to always press a second confirmation before initiating a call.

Apple says it initially worked with app developers to fix the vulnerability, and this update will now prevent it from happening even on apps that hadn’t already fixed the issue.
