Some of you are probably aware that the Revision demo-party is being arranged this weekend in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany. So far there has been several new releases and some of them are very, very good.

If youâ€™re into the Amstrad, youâ€™ll be pleased to hear about this brand new demo called Logonâ€™s Run â€“ 3D Meets the Aging BitsÂ from Logon System. Itâ€™s stunning, just stunning! A must see! Iâ€™ve embedded a YouTube-video of the demo running below and hope youâ€™ll watch it. ðŸ™‚ Have fun!|||
