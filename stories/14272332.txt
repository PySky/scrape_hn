A new images apparently showing the front and the back sides of the upcoming Meizu Pro 7, have been leaked today. It is certainly fair to say, the previous rumors and the leaked images have quietly induced a positive desire from both the Meizu fans and others. A lot had happened in the world, since the reports about the Pro 7 started emerging, but Meizu haven’t released it yet.

Today’s leak doesn’t bring us any big surprise. Yes, it seems that much of its design features are same as its predecessor, Pro 6S and Pro 6 Plus. On the display, the device is almost bezel-less, sharing the same look as the Samsung Galaxy S8.

The new image shows off a large display; the upper part of the device has some bezels to hold the selfie camera and the earpiece, while in the sides of the screen is fully bezel-less and there is no home button on the device’s chin.

To have the short look back, rumors said that the device features a 5.7 inch display, rendering a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels. It is expected to support AOD display, an enhanced display design and is powered by a Helio X30 processor. Moreover, it sports a 12MP rear camera with Sony’s IMX362 CMOS sensor.

Assuming these images to be true, we have to wait for a longer while, to get your hands over the Meizu Pro 7. Why because, the Meizu VP have recently stated that, the Meizu’s upcoming flagship display is still in doubt, and they are planning to avoid the full screen bezel-less display. However, this render looks quite pretty, and haven’t missed to grab our attraction.

On the whole, we had found a considerable volume of issues, depicting that it might either be a fan-made render or of some other variant’s. Let’s keep our fingers crossed to see, how the flagship actually looks like, as Meizu has planned to release it by this year.|||
