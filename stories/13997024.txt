The default jars contain AOT files for faster loading. If jar size is a concern, consider using the slim jar in production.

Tldr; here is a complete project using core.typed.

With the core.typed JAR in your classpath, run the following code to enable automatic type checking. This is how to start with Leiningen.

Next add the following metadata to the file you are working with.

Save the file and run . This should type check the file automatically.

It's useful to also import to annotate expressions.

Expressions evaluated via will also be type checked if the following is true at runtime: .

Use the core.typed mailing list for core.typed discussion, or try #typed-clojure on Freenode (the main developer is ambrosebs).

This used to point to the logs for the typed-clojure IRC channel, provided by Anthony Grimes. Anthony was an amazing human being, and the programming community will never be the same without him. His creativity, work ethic, and ability to engage with anyone around him was second to none. We miss him dearly.

RIP Anthony. You live on in your work and our hearts.

The ClojureScript checker has not followed the last year of upstream changes, so it does not work. If you would like to help update the checker, please post on the mailing list.
