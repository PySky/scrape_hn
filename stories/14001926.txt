What this will do is provision our VM to have 2048mb or memory, and use 1 virtual CPU. A decent rule of thumb is to use 1/8th of your computer’s RAM to dedicate to the VM.

We’re using instead of because it doesn’t have the annoying issue with Craft CMS 2.x that MySQL 5.7 does, MariaDB doesn’t whine about Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure, and it’s a more active codebase. Don’t worry, it’s a 100% drop-in replacement for MySQL, and it’s 100% compatible (it’s a fork of the same codebase, by the original author of MySQL). If for some reason you really don’t want to use MariaDB, just omit this line, and it’ll use MySQL by default.

allows you to map directories from your computer to your VM. This lets you use native editors like Sublime or PhpStorm to edit your code, while also allowing the VM to access the files as well.

Remember, the VM is effectively a separate computer, so this directory mapping is a bridge between the two. So you can edit the same files either on your computer, or in the VM. A key setting is to use as the because its a more performant way to do this file sharing/syncing.

lets you set up mappings from a domain name to a directory on the VM where the website lives. You can add as many as you want in the same VM.

lets you tell Homestead to create the mysql databases for you. Again, you can have as many databases as you like in the same VM.

Then we need to tell our computer where to find these sites by them to our file, which is at  on Mac/Linux, and at  on Windows:|||

Homestead is a provisioning tool which sets up a local development environment that allows you to work on webdev projects without fear. You get a modern…
