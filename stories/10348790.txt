YOU CAN'T BUY A GUN IF: you are under 18; you have a history of domestic abuse, substance abuse (like DUIs), or a history of mental illness.

Within New York City, you need a permit to buy a shotgun, rifle or handgun. Outside of the city, shotguns and rifles do not require a permit. Fill out a permit application. You are required to report your employment history for the prior five years for a background check.

Obtain a "Letter of Necessity" detailing the reasons for carrying a gun. Also required: four passport-style photographs, birth certificate, proof of residence, any arrests or summons for infractions more serious than a parking ticket, and any restraining orders.

Pay fees of $340 for the application and $94.25 for fingerprinting.

Submit reference letters from three people you have known for at least two years stating that you are "of good moral character."

After one to three months, you will receive an acceptance or denial letter. If approved, you have one month to pick up your Purchase Authorization from 1 Police Plaza. You can buy one handgun, pistol or revolver every 90 days, provided you send a Purchase Authorization Request Form to the NYPD and receive an authorization in return.

Take your gun for inspection at 1 Police Plaza. There, they will record the gun's serial number and fill out your license.
