However, over 78% of those that have secured jobs are in their major

Graduating from college and entering the job market is an exciting time.

However, it can also be a stressful time for students as they look to secure post-grad jobs to start paying back the massive amounts of debt they’ve collected. New data shows that more than 38 U.S. colleges cost more than a quarter of a million dollars to attend for four years!

So what do the 1.86 million students projected to earn a bachelor’s degree in 2017 have waiting for them when they walk across that stage into post-grad life?

With more than 70,000 students on the Door of Clubs platform — from over 300 colleges and universities across the country — we decided to find out.

In April 2017, we conducted the Door of Clubs “College Graduates’ Views on Job Prospects” online survey in the United States with 517 students graduating with a bachelor’s degree and entering the job market in 2017.

The respondent sample was spread across the country with:

Specifically, graduating students from Carnegie Mellon, Harvard, Boston College, Notre Dame, Northeastern, University of Georgia, San Jose State University, Seattle University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Arizona State University-Tempe, Morehouse College, University of Illinois-Chicago, and many more, participated in the survey.

As of the end of April, over 67% of graduating college students have not accepted a full-time job that will start upon graduation.

However, the close to 33% of college grads that do have jobs lined up after graduation have secured well-paying jobs in their field.

Over 78% of those who do have a job lined up are taking a position related to their major and 61% will be making more than $60,000 annually when they enter the workforce.

This seems to illustrate a strong job market and that those without positions may be holding out for better paying jobs in their major versus being ‘underemployed’.

Previous research from Accenture found that 40% of 2015 grads made less than $25,000 with their first jobs and 51% were underemployed. That same Accenture survey found that 80% of 2016 grads expect to earn at least $25,000 in their first job.

2017 college grad salary expectations seem to be on the rise again. Even those without a job lined up don’t expect to be making less than $25,000.

In fact, of the responding group in our survey that does not have a job lined up, 87% still expect to be making more than $30,000 annually and 56% expect to making more than $50,000 annually with their first post-college job.

Compare that with research of 2016 grads from iCIMS that found only 42% of 2016 grads expected a salary of at least $50,000 with their first job.

Of those with a post-grad job already lined up — engineering students (outside of computer engineering) are the big winners.

42% of engineering students (e.g Biomedical, Electrical, Chemical, Civil, Industrial, Aeronautical, Environmental) already have secured positions upon graduation.

84% of those engineering students will be making more than $60,o00 with those jobs.

This goes along with previous findings from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in Washington using Census bureau figures.

They found that chemical engineering majors have held down some of the best earnings of at least $60,000 a year for entry level positions since the recession.|||
