While I working on my practical part of my Masters Degree Thesisâ€Šâ€”â€Šmobile application for tree leafs recognition, I start working with Tensorflow neural network. After retraining of final layer for my images, I have a trained data. (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining)

I have Node.js server on Heroku. I want to try to install my Python Flask server code with Tensorflow calls on Heroku too. It is possible, but how to do this?

First, prepare your python runtime.txt file for specifying python version.

And file requirements.txt with your python dependencies.

After deploy of your code to Heroku, a server automatically runs pip install -r requirements.txt to install your python dependencies.

Now itâ€™s time to write Flask server and Tensorflow code.

The last thing which we need is to create Procfile with the following content.

But, Heroku server has only 500MB of RAM. And this can be a problem for stable running of some Tensorflow tasks. For my code (image recognition), is Heroku server not fit very well. Because RAM, but if you run some more basic Tensorflow operations, Heroku can by ok.

After this small experiment (I was curious if it is possible), I running my code on Amazon EC2 with Ubuntu 16 LTS. Amazon EC2 fit for Tensorflow very well and you have more options and control above your server.|||
