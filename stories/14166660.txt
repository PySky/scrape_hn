DUUUUUUDDDDEEE! What is up with your co-workers trying to schedule a meeting at 4pm on a Friday? Could there be anything worse? The anger level inside of me just thinking about this malarky just hit the danger zone. If you break the social code, you should be shunned! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!

Don’t worry, I am here to help. I am going to push this weekend and your health like Fox News pushed Bill O’Reilly out the door. Too soon? If your boss is there holding you back from sunshine, a cold drink and dinner with friends, I am the happy leprechaun in the corner ready to blind him or her with rainbows. Think Chucky mixed with the Care Bears. Make a break for the weekend. READY, SET, GO!
