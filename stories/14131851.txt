Automatically trigger post deployment API tests with the new Assertible GitHub integration. Testing changes on staging and production environments is a critical part of running a web service. Our goal at Assertible is to make web app testing easier and more effective with this 3 step process to automatically test every deployment:

To start testing your web application deployments, you simply need to install the Assertible integration and send deployment events to a repository from your CI or CD pipeline. The GitHub Deployments Quick Start guide provides a walk through of the process.

Assertible connects to your GitHub repository to receive deployment events. Once you're GitHub account is connected, you can configure Assertible to watch your GitHub repository for deployments.

Assertible will run your tests after a succesful deployment. Some continuous integration and deployment providers will work out of the box without any other configuration. For example, see how you can continuously test Heroku GitHub deployments.

You can send deployment events to your GitHub repository from any CI provider or custom script. The assertible/deployments repo contains example integrations for popular CI services like Travis-CI and Wercker.

Once you've got your GitHub account connected, and your deployment pipeline is set up to send events, then you're all set! You can now start creating tests for your web service, making assertions, and setting up Slack notifications.

After this original post, we added support for continuous testing status checks on GitHub. If you deploy to a staging or review environment from GitHub Pull Requests, you can add status checks to ensure your API tests are passing before merging new features. Check out the blog post.

I'd love to hear from you! Have any feedback on this article, or just want to talk API testing? Hit me up on Twitter (@CodyReichert or @AssertibleApp) or send us a message.|||

The Assertible GitHub integration makes it easy to automate your QA pipeline by running post deployment API tests every time you deploy your web application.
