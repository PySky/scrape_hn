Dear Init Freedom Lovers,Once again the Veteran Unix Admins salute you!Our April 2017 gift to you is the long-awaited release of DevuanJessie stable release candidate (1.0.0-RC). If all goes as planned,this will be our first Devuan stable release and our first long termsupport (LTS) release as well.Two and a half years have passed since our initial Debianforkdeclaration ( https://devuan.org/os/debian-fork/ ) and not even one yearsince our first beta release http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/devuan-beta-release ).This Devuan Jessie release candidate is as close as we can get to a"long term support" universal base distribution free from systemd, inthe original spirit of Debian.The final Devuan Jessie release will follow shortly and then we willturn our attention to "Ascii", the current testing branch.We wish to thank all of you for the incredible support given to thisdevelopment effort, and for engaging in the process of making Devuan auseful and reliable base distro, as well as a pleasant, cooperativecommunity.# What has improved in Devuan JessieThe wifi autodetection problems present in the beta release serieshave been fixed.The problem that prevented samba from installing has been fixed.Devuan now directly provides different base distribution flavours:desktop-live (finally the purpy experience), embedded, minimal-liveand installer-iso.Devuan's Simple Distro Kit (SDK) is rapidly approaching maturity, witha full set of scripts and documentation to roll your own Devuan-baseddistro in any flavor. ( https://dev1galaxy.org/viewtopic.php?id=551 The Refracta scripts are now included in Devuan, which makes it easyto toast a new live distro from the state of a running one.Devuan's infrastructure is now powered by the 'debbugs' bug trackingsystem originally written by Ian Jackson, and the 'reportbug' toolworks as expected.Package maintenance has been demystified and partially automated withd1h - the Devuan packaging helper https://dev1galaxy.org/viewtopic.php?id=549 ) - which simplifies thetask of interacting with the Devuan continuous integration pipelineand makes it easier for developers to package their projects forDevuan correctly. Please consider rolling up your sleeves and joiningthe development team!ARM support has improved: Devuan now provides base SD card images for11 different hardware platforms: raspi1, raspi2, raspi3, chromeacer,chromeveyron, cubieboard2, cubietruck, lime2, micro, N900,odroidxu. When applicable (sunxi boards) ARM images are powered bymainline 4.10.y Linux kernels.# DownloadsOfficial Devuan images are distributed via the websiteTo ease the load on our bandwidth we kindly ask you to use one of thefollowing mirrors:All files offered for download come with their SHA256 hash to checkthe integrity (either in the SHA256SUMS or in the .sha files) and witha cryptographic signature made using GnuPG by one of the Devuandevelopers in charge of the build, included as .asc file.An understanding of Devuan's script-friendly file naming scheme anddirectory structure will help you find what youneed.

We think people should be able to choosewhether to use a GNU+Linux system with or without systemd.Devuan decided to fork not only the base distribution, but also itsgovernance, because Debian has made it difficult to avoid systemd asinit, entangling the system with unnecessary dependencies. Weencourage potential Devuan users who wish to install systemd to useDebian's installer, Debian's packages and Debian's mailing lists, allavailable directly from Debian's mirrors.Devuan is the Debian that was and could have been. Our goal is toprovide a viable and sustainable alternative. It is a new path,nurtured with your help and support.To support the Devuan project: https://devuan.org/donate happy hacking ;^)|||
