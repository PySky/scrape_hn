Ethereum is all the rage right now, promising one world computer that anyone can deploy arbitrary code (known as smart contracts) to. But if you actually try to get started writing your own smart contracts, you might find the entire ecosystem a little tricky to wrap your head around.



Fortunately, Will Warren stops by to help me set up an Ethereum dev environment and teach me the basics of writing and deploying smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain.



First we write a hello world contract, and compile it using both the browser based solidity compiler and an ethereum dev framework called truffle. Once we get the hang of the workflow deploying and querying contracts against the local dev environment, we create our own metacoin from scratch and figure out how to deploy it to the live Ethereum testnet. We also talk about some basic smart contract design patterns, and some nuts and bolts of how Ethereum works under the hood. If you're interested in Cryptocurrency, you don't want to miss it.
