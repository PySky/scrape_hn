Apple is staffing up as it is reportedly developing new products for augmented reality technology, where digital images and/or audio are layered on top of natural sights and sounds. Think: Games, entertainment, apps, maps, etc.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman takes a dive into Apple’s AR efforts so far and reports:

Perhaps most interesting in the short term will be the sort of AR features Apple decides to introduce in the iPhone.

For example, Gurman reports some potentially forthcoming iPhone photo features, such as “the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later.”

It’s also easy to see Apple adding simple AR features similar to Snapchat filters — who wouldn’t want to face-swap over FaceTime? — and even potentially opening the capabilities up to developers.|||

A former Dolby executive is leading the charge, Bloomberg reports.
