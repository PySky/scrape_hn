We’d love you to try our product, VisualFeedback. Once you create an account, adding a small code snippet to your site will allow you to get valuable feedback from your users. Feedback that helps you improve conversion, drive sales, measure brand loyalty and increase customer satisfaction.

The code snippet loads asynchronously, which means that it wont slow down your site. If you decide VisualFeedback is not for you, just remove the snippet at any time.

Best of all, VisualFeedback is totally free to use while we are in alpha and beta.

Your feedback button allows your users to leave feedback at any time. You can choose from three different types of feedback button when you create your account.

You can also request that we change the colour or text of the feedback button

By default, clicking the feedback button will show this form.

But we can customise it to exactly match your requirements. We can add your logo or remove certain questions. Just let us know what you want.

You will receive an email notification about any feedback received. You can manage your feedback in the feedback inbox.

Each feedback response comes with a screenshot so you can see what page the feedback was submitted from.
