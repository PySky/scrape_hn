Note: The package is not "go get" able, just copy and paste it to your project and adjust it to your needs.

This custom handler lets you combine routes definition with your handler definition, do authentication and parameters validation in a clean expressive way, and stop thinking about handlers names .

{ Optional: Description for your handler (used in API file generation). Optional: Request HTTP method. If not specified, it will accept any method. [] Optional: Choose to authenticate client or not using a predefined function. []http. []http. (w http. , r *http. ) }

Handler works with the standard go http.ServeMux, but allows you to provide different handlers for the same uri using different methods.

Validation works with the provided Params string array. Which should look like this:

You should write the authentication logic in the auth function to do authentication, then you choose to authenticate the client for a certain handler by defining the Auth filed to be true.

Use Before and After fields to add middlewares to the handler.

Do whatever you like with the code.|||
