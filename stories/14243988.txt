About.com is about to become something else.

The all-purpose, general interest website that dates back to the earliest days of the internet is disappearing for good Tuesday after a year-long process that broke the operation into a constellation of niche-focused sites.

The company, which has been owned by Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActiveCorp IAC, -0.72%   since 2012, will now be called Dotdash as the About.com site is retired.

The logic, according to Dotdash Chief Executive Neil Vogel, is that a broad omnibus site tends to underperform on the social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat that drive the internet today, making it less valuable to advertisers. “About.com is a funny thing. Everyone knows what it is, but it doesn’t mean anything to anyone,” he said.
