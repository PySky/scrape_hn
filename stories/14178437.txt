One click personal VPN server on DigitalOcean with automated OSX setup. The deployed VPN server includes automated updates of both the OS and VPN software, so you don't need to worry about managing a server.

The easiest way is to download a pre-built binary from the GitHub Releases page. This is a packaged OSX app.

A web server is started on application launch and directs you to your web browser. It uses client OAuth authentication to request access to your DigitalOcean account (this permission is revoked after deployment). Once authenticated, a 512MB droplet is deployed running CoreOS that is configured to auto update on new releases. The OS is configured to launch a container (dosxvpn/strongswan) on boot running strongSwan.|||
