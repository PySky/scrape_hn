Fans of the PS2 emulator Play! received the first October weekly build for the version 0.30.

EDIT: Corrected release date & name of the pre-latest weekly build.

Weekly build was released on October 4, therefore it’s build “2015-10-04”. This is the first time Play! has been updated since September 27, when the weekly build  “2015-09-27” was released.

Project Play! aims to emulate PlayStation 2 on Windows, OSX and iOS and Android platforms. It is the first PlayStation 2 emulator for Android and has cause quite a fuss since the release of Android verson in July 2015. At the moment, it’s in early stages, but the developer Jean-Philip Desjardins is working on it.
