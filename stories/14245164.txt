In order to create a better flow we decided to group the events in different sections of the week. In the beginning of the week, during the Create section, most events are all about how to get started with your startup or idea. Maybe you have an idea but do not know what steps to begin with, or maybe you just want to be a part of creating something from scratch, then this part of the week is for you!

During the middle of the week, the Launch section, the events will target you who is already started with your startup. How do you take the next steps? How do you get your startup ready for an investment? Or maybe you want to join a bit more stable startup, which still is in an early stage.

The last part of the week, the Scale section, we aim to target you who are ready to do some scaling. You are raising an investment round, or maybe looking for that big collaboration with a major actor, or maybe you are looking to join a startup that are on their way to revolutionize the world!|||
