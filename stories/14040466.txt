Final project grades and feedback from your TA are now available on Omnivore, and final letter grades should be available soon on WebSIS.

Don’t forget to submit your individual reflection for the project. It was due at 1pm, but will be accepted for as long as the submission form is open.

The final group project is due tomorrow at 1pm.

Tomorrow is the last 6.005 class of the semester. We will have a brief wrap-up and summary of the course.

Quiz 2 grades are now available on Omnivore. You will receive an email from Gradescope with a link to review your graded quiz.

Quiz 2 solutions are posted on the web site.

As with all assignments, please bring grading issues or questions to instructor office hours. Gradescope has a “regrade request” feature, but we will not be using it. You can also review the course grading and letter grade policies on the web site.

The final group project is now on the course web site, and project teams and mentors are posted on Omnivore.

In tomorrow’s class, after we practice team version control with Git, you will meet with your team, create and clone your project repo, check in with your TA mentor, and start writing your team contract. The team contract is due tomorrow night, and the first project milestone is due this Sunday night.|||
