Recent stem cell research has given rise to experiments that yield ce ll differentiation from

undifferentiated cells, to specialized cells such as brain c ells, or large sp ecialized cell groups

such as embryonic bodies. I examine progress in mathematical stem cell modelling, that

indicate stem cell proliferation as a potentially viable ap proach in some degre e of

software artificial general intelligence, where (a) stem cells are already observed to generate

artificial general intellig ence in nature given some in itial configuration and (b) c urrent

computin g limits may house the required number of proliferation steps, from

undifferentiation some region of the mammalian brain aligned embryonic state, such as

visual cortex system (determination & differentiation). This paper then discusses that it is

likely optimal to -describe how we approach machine learning the aforesaid

The dawn of machine learning aligned with the manual encoding of intelligent systems, where

researchers wou ld attempt to encode rules, for various scenarios. However, for unseen scenarios

such manually prepared rules were ob served to fail. Machine learning algorithms such as neural

models, eventually e merged as more viable systems , where researc hers instead program models

that learn rules (Silver, Hassabis, Huang et al., 2016) Researchers though, still largely manually

design these units/connections (artificial neurons/synapses) that perform the prior

automation in machine learning methods progressed, perfor mance in tasks have dramatically

improved, and more cognitive processes began to be approximated by t hese n ewer models .

Stem cell modelling is typically defined as a measure of examining various forms of tissue

repair. I argue that stem software cell modelling, particularly pluripotent cells that engender

brain cells (Yang, Liu et al., is a some degree artificial|||
