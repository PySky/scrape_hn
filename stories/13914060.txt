After many years, decided to do one last fun documentation on the craze we helped get started: sneckdowns!

In the simplest terms, sneckdown is a portmanteau of "snow" and "neckdown" (a technical, archaic term for a curb extension of a sidewalk.) When it snows it becomes visually obvious in intersections the places where vehicles usually do not drive, thus evidence of streets we have overbuilt so a car driver can go faster and more recklessly.

When it snows it is like a piece of nature's tracing paper, showing these areas of the roadway that are extraneous (for the most part). In many cases, you could give these spots to pedestrians, you may not be able to give the fully measured space, but it is highly likely if you can show 10 feet of extra asphalt, you probably could very easily repurpose half of that. (Note: That's a Streetfilms math projection.)

If this is your first sneckdown exposure, you'll probably be just fine. But to get a great idea of how this all started, you may want to check out the first two films in the Streetfilms series.

The first video is 2006's "Street Lessons from a Blizzard": vimeo.com/12796677

The second is 2011's "Snowy Neckdowns Redux": vimeo.com/19607481
