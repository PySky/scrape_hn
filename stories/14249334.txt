MTN Group have announced the shutdown of their video streaming service, MTN VU, effective 3 May 2017. MTN VU was originally launched in late 2014 as MTN FrontRow.

MTN VU customers were notified earlier on 2 May 2017 of the video streaming service being decomissioned.

"We regret to inform you that we’ll soon be saying farewell to MTN VU, Which we’ll be shutting on 3 May 2017. Thank you for enjoying some of the world’s best entertainment with us." said MTN in a statement to customers.

This shutdown is despite MTN VU being zero-rated on the MTN network for customers. Added to this, MTN has said that current MTN VU customers will receive a free three-months subscription service to another video streaming service, ShowMax.

"As a gesture of goodwill, we will pay three months of ShowMax subscriptions at no extra cost to affected customers. The decision to discontinue VU does not signal a departure from this space, we are still committed to becoming a significant player in this field. To this end, we will announce new services to the market at an appropriate time," said Maxwell Nonge, Chief Digital Officer at MTN South Africa.|||
