 Now a days, OAuth2 is quite popular. We are not going to in depth of how it’s work. We will develop application which will use devise and omniauth2 so, our application will have feature of signup using omniauth or devise.



 I am taking google as an example. or a full list of these providers, please check OmniAuth’s list of strategies . Go to google developer console and register our application. Google will authorise it next time when it will ask authentications using google. Click on create “OAuth consent screen” link and fill in require information. After saving go to “Credentials” link and click on “Create credentials”. It will have several options. Click on “OAuth client id”. Follow the instructions and you will have “Client ID” and “Client secrete” at the end. It will require while configuring devise. 





 Few gems will be needed to implement this feature. Lets add these to our Gemfile and run command to install them.



 I am assuming that we know how to setup devise for authentication in rails app. Follow this to see how to setup devise. 





 For this we need to update our users table. We need to add the columns “provider” (string) and “uid” (string) to your User model.

NOTE: we are using omniauth with devise hence no need to add provider middleware again in config/initializers/omniauth.rb

Now, declare the provider in your config/initializers/devise.rb.

Client_ID, Client_Secret and callback_url are generated in step1. callback_url may look like http://localhost:3000/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback.

This will configure our strategy, we need to make our model (e.g. app/models/user.rb) omniauthable:

we can add multiple providers. Now devise is already setup so it will create the following url methods:

we can use this path methods to generate signin link i.e. <%= link_to “Sign in with Google+”, user_google_oauth2_omniauth_authorize_path %>.

By clicking on the above link, the user will be redirected to Google. (If this link doesn’t exist, try restarting the server.) After inserting their credentials, they will be redirected back to your application’s callback method. To implement a callback, the first step is to go back to our config/routes.rb file and tell Devise in which controller we will implement Omniauth callbacks:

Now add the file app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb and implemente callback as an action with the same name as the provider. Here is an example action for our google provider that we could add to our controller:

Here, all information retrieved from Google by OmniAuth is available as a hash at request.env[“omniauth.auth”]. Now, Implement method to our user model.

This method tries to find an existing user by the provider and uid fields. If no user is found, a new one is created with a random password and some extra information.

Finally, if you want to allow your users to cancel sign up with Google, you can redirect them to cancel_user_registration_path. This will remove all session data starting with devise. and the new_with_session hook above will no longer be called.
