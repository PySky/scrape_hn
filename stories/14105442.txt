The canvas element in HTML5 is used to render simple graphics such as line art, graphs and other custom graphical elements on the client side web development. With <canvas> tag, you can simply put the element in the page, name it with an id attribute and define its dimensions with height and width attributes. Along with placing a <canvas> tags in a document, you have to use JavaScript code to access and draw lines and shapes.

HTML5 defines a complete API for drawing on a canvas element such as lines, triangles, rectangle and circle, which is composed of many individual sub-API for common tasks. To draw lines and other more shapes using HTML5 canvas, the path API must be used. The path API stores a collection of subpaths formed by various shape functions.

Here are the various shape functions used in JavaScript code which can be used to draw lines, triangle, rectangles and circles.

context.beginPath() - This function is used to begin a path.

context.lineTo() - This function is used to draw line.

context.stroke() - This function will display the path as a newly created shape.

context.closePath() - This function will connect the last point and first point.

context.fill() - This function will be filled in with whatever the fill color is or black if none is specified.

Following is an example code which draws a line using HTML5 canvas. The functions "context.beginPath()", "context.lineTo()" and "context.stroke()" used within a JavaScript function draws a line, which was embedded within canvas element written within HTML5 code.

Here is an example code which draws a rectangle using HTML5 canvas. The functions "context.beginPath()", "context.rect()" and "context.fill()" used within a JavaScript function draws a rectangle filled with green color, which was embedded within canvas element written within HTML5 code.

Followng is an example code which draws a circle using HTML5 canvas. The functions "context.beginPath()", "context.arc()", "context.fill()" and "context.stroke()" used within a JavaScript function draws a circle filled with pink color, which was embedded within canvas element written within HTML5 code.
