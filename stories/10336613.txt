Currently, We dont have anything which helps us in reusing open source (especialy in git repositories) code. We see code - like it - clone it - copy file / folder and put it in our project and same code gets push in our repository, why? Why code redundancies?

Should be straight forward copy paste and put third party libraries in .gitignore - simple! And there shouldnt be any complexity needed to update libraries with latest changes.

There are two ways to install quack. Both should have roughly the same outcome, but have their advantages/disadvantages.

This method will always produce some stable build, but may not be the most up to date version. New functionality will come slower than building from this repo.

Note, depending on your computer's settings, you may need to .

This method will always include the latest features, but sometimes will not work at all. Oops!

Clone the repo, then use setup.py to install the package. Note, this process will differ only slightly in a non-bash shell.

Note, depending on your computer's settings, you may need to .

Once you have quack installed, adding quack plugins to your project is done with the quack.yaml configuration file.

Add a file called quack.yaml to the root of your project. The pre-commit config file describes:

Above command will look for file or create, if not found, and execute profile's instructions as a default profile.

You can provide your custom file (such as ). Above command will execute given profile within configuration file.
