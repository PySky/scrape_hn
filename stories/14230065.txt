There’s been ample commentary about bias one way or another in the mainstream media. These days however, it is supplemented by an additional type of bias: the bias in who authors all the non-commercial blog posts, medium stories, tweets, etc that you may or may not be reading.

Most people are of course way too busy/tired/whatever to sit down and actually compose something. If you’re going to be participating to any greater extent, then it takes copious spare time and a deep need to write or to have your voice heard.

An unsubstantiated rule of thumb I heard years ago said that about 1% of users on a site like medium/twitter/reddit actually write anything as opposed to just read whatever is already there.

This will inevitably bias the output.

A somewhat mitigating factor is that more people vote / share / re-tweet than write.

I’m not entirely clear yet on how this bias might impact the content produced, but I’m guessing most authors lean younger or older (= no kids, since that tends to suck up any spare time you may have previously enjoyed), and are pretty idealistic / passionate about whatever they’re writing about (seriously, can we have yet another fight about controversial issue X where the exact same arguments get rehashed by different people all over again please?).

But there are probably tons of other reasons I’m not familiar with.

Personally, I’m mostly writing because it forces me to create a somewhat coherent structure to my thoughts. And I guess I hope I have some thoughts worth sharing.|||
