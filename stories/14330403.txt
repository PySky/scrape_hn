Director Doug Liman said the next film in the science fiction saga Edge of Tomorrow would continue the intrigue of the first opus, and would serve as prequel to the franchise.

Liman spoke recently to We Got This Covered while promoting his upcoming film The Wall

Liman also spoke to Collider about the sequel:

“We have an amazing story! It’s incredible! Way better than the first film, and I obviously loved the first film. It will be called Live Die Repeat and Repeat. Tom [Cruise] is excited about it, and Emily Blunt is excited about it. The big question is just when we’ll do it. But it’s not an if, it’s a when.”

“I’ve had some radical ideas about how to make a sequel that would interest me, in the same way that I had ideas of how you make an independent film and then Swingers came along and it was like ‘Aha, that’s the perfect movie for me to test these ideas out on.’ I had these intellectual ideas on how you should make a sequel that are unlike how anybody else makes a sequel, and this script and this idea fit perfectly into that idea. So it’s gonna revolutionize how people make sequels. And again that’s why I try to do things like Invisible that are just, the revolution’s sort of built into the idea. It’s more heresy in the film world for me to pitch things that are sort of unheard of.”

Edge of Tomorrow was released in 2014 and got critical acclaim and was well received by audience. The movie reached more than $370 Million globally and more than $100 Million domestically with an estimated budget of $178 Million.|||
