A few years ago, I said the (then still-rumored retina) MacBook would likely be the last computer I ever buy. I lied.

Don’t get me wrong, that MacBook is great. Yes, the one USB-C port remains a stretch at times. But I make it work. The battery life is just okay. But that’s also not a major issue for me. As expected, it’s a near-perfect machine.

The bigger issue is that it’s just a little slow. I get a few too many beach balls when trying to do fairly simple stuff. So that left me with a choice last year: upgrade to the new, slightly faster MacBook. Or wait for the new, super-fast and newly redesigned MacBook Pro. I went for the latter.

I’m starting to think I should have gone with the former.

The new MacBook Pro is fine. It’s pretty fast — certainly faster than my MacBook. But it’s not noticeably faster from the machine I have at work: a MacBook Pro from three years ago. Generally, I like the new design. It’s sleek, a bit lighter, and I appreciate the multiple ports.¹

The battery is more troubling. While, again, it’s fine, it’s not great compared to that three year old machine I have. And, this machine will have the dubious distinction of being the first Apple computer I’ve ever owned that has broken.

Computers get messed up from time to time. But I’ve always prided myself in being able to fix such problems. This one, try as I might, I could not. One day, it simply would not turn on. After a visit to the Genius Bar, they confirmed the worst: it needed a full logic board replacement. A lobotomy.

It’s back now and working fine. To be honest, I’m not 100% sure they didn’t just give me an entirely new machine. The battery life actually seems better — could just be in my head…

Anyway, all of that aside, if I’m being honest, I still just don’t love this machine. And that has never been the case for me with previous Macs. Again, it’s fine. It’s thinner and lighter than my old MacBook Pro — but not more so than the MacBook. It’s faster than the MacBook, but not noticeably more than the old MacBook Pro. The big, new selling point of this device was supposed to be the Touch Bar.

I’ve had the machine for months at this point and I almost never use the Touch Bar for anything beyond what I would use the old function keys for — tweaking the brightness and volume, etc — and the default settings on the Touch Bar actually make that harder to do (though you can change them).

The customized Touch Bar bits are completely underwhelming. This is true both in first-party Apple apps like Safari and for third-party apps that did the work to integrate functionality. I almost never use any of these things.

Of course, I grew up used to the old keys. But it’s hard to see anyone getting much use out of these digital keys. They’re all style and very little substance. They seem to exist simply because something had to be new in the new MacBook Pro. Touch ID is by far the most useful part of the strip. But even then, I enabled unlock-with-Apple-Watch on the device, which happens before I even get to use Touch ID to unlock — so, Apple Pay? I guess?|||
