Forget those non-tech hand warmer packs, gamers, because the Danes have a gadget solution for your sad, frozen hands. A company called Envavo has designed something called the Heatbuff, which basically works as a highly targeted space heater for gamers’ hands. They put it on Kickstarter this week. I wasn’t aware that gamers’ hands got cold while gaming, or that they needed to be kept warm, but I guess this is a legitimate issue. There’s even a three-year-old Reddit thread about it. If a Reddit thread exists, clearly it’s a fact.

The Heatbuff is an infrared short wave heater, which again, translates to space heater. It starts at $71 and is designed to keep fingers warm either between matches or during them.

Now, Envavo says it’s doing testing on its finger warmer. They’re assuring us their product is safe to use and won’t even heat up your keyboard. But still, I’m worried that keeping a space heater plugged in while you game for hours near an already hot PC is dangerous. Maybe just take breaks for good measure? Or put faith in Envavo. Do what feels good for you. It sounds nice to have warm hands, regardless of whether you’re gaming or not. Us bloggers could use a finger space heater, too. Don’t forget about the bloggers. Please.|||
