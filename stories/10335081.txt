Warpstock is the annual conference for OS/2 and eComStation users,

administrators, and developers. Warpstock 2015 will be held at the

Drury Plaza Hotel Broadview Wichita, Friday, October 23 through

Sunday, October 25, 2015.

The Warpstock Board of Directors is working hard to make this another

enjoyable and informative event. We invite you to participate, either

as a presenter or as an attendee. 2015 has been - and should continue

to be - a year of motion and progress for the OS/2 community at large,

so there should be a lot to discuss at this year's Warpstock!
