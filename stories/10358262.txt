The Cardiff Conversation Database (CCDb) is an ongoing project, that provides a non-scripted, audio-visual natural conversation database where neither participant's role is predefined (i.e. speaker/listener). This database will be a useful resource for the computer vision, affective computing, and cognitive science communities to both analyse natural dyadic conversational data and develop conversation models.

The data has been captured in both 2D and 3D.

The original CCDb capture (for which 2D data only is currently released) is described in the following paper:

A.J. Aubrey, D. Marshall, P.L. Rosin, J. Vandeventer, D.W. Cunningham, C. Wallraven, "Cardiff Conversation Database (CCDb): A Database of Natural Dyadic Conversations", V & L Net Workshop on Language for Vision, 2013.

The subsequent CCDb capture (for which the 3D data is available) is described in the following paper:

J. Vandeventer, A.J. Aubrey, P.L. Rosin, D. Marshall, "4D Cardiff Conversation Database (4D CCDb): A 4D Database of Natural, Dyadic Conversations", Joint Conf. on Facial Analysis, Animation and Auditory-Visual Speech Processing, 2015.

To annotate the whole database requires a massive effort, and is time consuming. Therefore, the communityâ€™s assistance is sought to help complete the task of annotating and validating the remaining conversations. Please contact Professor David Marshall or Professor Paul Rosin if you would like to help.|||
