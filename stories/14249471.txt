Well, for over 20 years, people around the world have had a blast playing the classic “3×3 celeb voting game” with friends. No one agrees on what to call it (especially in other countries!) but it’s penetrated pop culture with countless appearances in hit movies, TV shows, top YouTube videos and more.
