A Saturday afternoon on Lake Ivanhoe turned deadly for a man who jumped from a boat and never resurfaced.

Orlando Police spokesman Richard Ruth said multiple agencies and dive teams from Orlando and Orange County responded to the popular recreation lake off Orange Avenue at 5:39 p.m.

He said witnesses told police the man, identified as Jason Seifer, 36, jumped off a tube behind a black-and-white Bayliner about

Orlando Fire District Chief Bryan Davis said the man was boating with three friends, who jumped in the water to look for him when he didn’t come back up. They unsuccessfully searched for some time before docking and calling 911, he said.

Dive teams got in the water and used a boat to search for Seifer for about an hour before switching from a rescue attempt to a recovery effort. Davis said the Sheriff’s Office was then called to help and they eventually found Seifer using a sophisticated sonar system.

Seifer was found in about 20 feet of water, near a thick patch of weeds, Davis said. He was declared dead at the scene. A medical examiner’s van arrived at the scene shortly before 9 p.m.

Davis said Seifer and his friends are locals, who are often out on the water.

Lake Ivanhoe is a popular spot for swimmers and boaters. Signs near the boat ramp warned visitors to swim at their own risk.

Davis said no foul play is suspected, but Orlando Police will investigate.|||
