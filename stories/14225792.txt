This document describes PHP coding standards for Phabricator and related projects (like Arcanist and libphutil).

This document outlines technical and style guidelines which are followed in libphutil. Contributors should also follow these guidelines. Many of these guidelines are automatically enforced by lint.

These guidelines are essentially identical to the Facebook guidelines, since I basically copy-pasted them. If you are already familiar with the Facebook guidelines, you probably don't need to read this super thoroughly.

You should always put braces around the body of an if clause, even if it is only one line long. Note spaces around operators and after control statements. Do not use the "endif" construct, and write "else if" as two words.

Prefer $ii, $jj, $kk, etc., as iterators, since they're easier to pick out visually and react better to "Find Next..." in editors.

statements should be indented to block level.

Use a trailing comma and put the closing parenthesis on a separate line so that diffs which add elements to the array affect only one line.|||
