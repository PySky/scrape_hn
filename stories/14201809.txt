The Ford Mustang is now the world’s best selling sports car, according to a Ford analysis of IHS Markit data. The company has long sold the Mustang in the United States, but has recently pushed an international expansion of the vehicle, with 45,000 Mustangs sold outside the US in 2016, up 101 percent from the year before. Germany and China made up most of the growth.

That expansion means that the Mustang is now sold in 140 countries, with a quarter of sixth-generation Mustang sales (model year 2015 through today) shipped to customers outside the US. Beginning with the 2018 Mustang, the car will go on sale in six additional countries including Brazil, the Palau Islands, and the Ivory Coast.

Somewhat strangely, IHS wouldn’t specify what makes up a “sports car” in its rankings, nor would it give The Verge data on what the second-most popular sports car is — but it did confirm that Ford’s analysis is correct. Other sports cars that IHS tracked include the BMW 4 Series, the Nissan 370z, the Porsche 911, and the Mazda MX-5.

The 2018 Mustang will be the first in decades not to have a V6 engine, but the new model will boast a new 10-speed transmission, as well as an upgraded 5-liter V8 in the Mustang GT. And, for good measure, here are a bunch of cool pictures Ford sent over of the Mustang in various countries around the world.|||
