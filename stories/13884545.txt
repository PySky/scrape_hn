For the first Get Noticed 2017 entry I wanted to initialise my smog alert chatbot.

I've started with some requirements and formed some user stories as these usually tackle use cases for software neatly.

I'm also planning to add Slack and maybe Google Hangouts as alternatives for Facebook Messenger.

I went through available gems for FB Messenger bot API and a few look promising:

Ideally, I would like to have bot's logic separated from communications API.

On the other side of the app there is AQICN database API. Unfortunately, they do not provide webhooks or any other form of push notifications/streaming, so I'll have to implement a polling mechanism.

I was thinking about using just Ruby, without Rails, but some of the libraries I want to try are Rails Engines so it might be easier to just bootstrap a classic Rails app, and that's what I did. Next time I'll add fetching data from AQICN.

Sidenote: my girlfriend has joined Get Noticed 2017, you can read about her project on her blog (in Polish). Since she plays an electric violin she will be writing an Apple Watch violin tuner.|||
