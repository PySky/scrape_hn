This is a python library with will work on Raspberry Pi out of the box. It will work on Macbook Pro too, you will need to install the keyboard_leds program for it to control the capslock led.This is an Arduino library that will work on out of the box. There is a sample program that can blink the on-board LED.

The LED is utilized to send binary data, in which if it is ON (lighted) it would be considered bit 1, if switched OFF then bit 0 is transmitted, it will have to maintain the state for 250ms.

This message consists of packets and a packet consists of a Byte preceded by a start bit (1) and suffixed by a stop bit (0).

Preamble is used to determine the start of message, the entire message is usually transmitted in a loop and the preamble helps to figure out the start of the message. The preamble used is 0xf0.

This packet contains information for decoding the rest of the message and consists of the following fields.

00 as this is the firstversion.

These 2 bits would specify the mode of the message and their meanings is as follows.

There is at least 1 byte in the message and the length is the number of additional bytes apart from this 1 byte.

The Vendor ID would be allocated by registering and would identify the vendor.

This is an ID that is generated by the Vendor with the exception that the byte cannot be equal to the preamble.

In case if one of the byte is exactly same as the preamble, it would be transmitted twice, similar to what is done in regex where you have to escape a wildcard character. In this case the number of data packets received would be more than the size provided in the metadata packet.|||
