In the presentation, I will try to look at programming as a way of expressing ideas. I will present a nearly sixty-year-old culture of embracing thoughts in parentheses of expressions, and contrast it with the fads of the contemporary world of computing.



I will explain the significance (and limitations) of functional programming, and present some ways of making code easier to read.



Speaker: Maciej Godek



Panicz Godek is a philosopher and a programmer. He believes that programming is as essential to participating in the culture of the XXI century as reading and writing was in the XX century.



In his spare time, he works on a game that trains programming skills, and that is also a platform for the development and application of Artificial Intelligence methods. In his battle against the Babel tower of programming languages, he recently wrote "A Pamphlet against R", available (CC-BY-SA) from https://panicz.github.io/pamphlet|||
