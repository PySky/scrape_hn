It is pretty common to hear veterans bragging (or whining!) about how hard it was to develop in the early days, without enough RAM, or the Internet, or using a cassette as data storage, and so on.

How about developing without a keyboard to type your program in? That’s what, apparently, Nintendo developer Masahiro Sakurai used to create the first Kirby’s Dream Land. The game was developed on a Twin Famicom, a console that combined the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System. The only input device supported was a trackball that could be used with the on-screen keyboard!

One could argue that people with some kind of disability might need to use something similar nowadays, which is true but it doesn’t take away the fact that this must be pretty hard, mainly if you could be using something more efficient.
