The package is available on the Atom website: atom-unsaved-changes.

Or find the package in Settings → Install and search for "atom-unsaved-changes"

In order to close the panel showing the changes, just press again .

Adds will be shown with a green background, removes with a red background. A few lines of surrounding unchanged text are also shown for context. A yellow line separates hunks.

Note: Compares whitespace. If a line ends with a whitespace a symbol ∅ is appended at the end of the line.

This repository has been forked from unsaved-changes because it was not maintained any more, and in order to correct bugs.|||
