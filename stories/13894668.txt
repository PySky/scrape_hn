Landing a job is hard work. While it’s impossible to know (beforehand) the answer to every question that an interviewer asks you, there are a few common questions that you can prepare for. Nailing the answers to these won’t guarantee you a job, but they will improve your chances of success. Just remember to tailor them to each individual interview based on the job description and company.

Below is my list of seven fundamental UX interview questions, along with tips and tricks on how to answer them.

Even though this is a fairly general question, don’t provide general answers. Focus on giving a specific definition that sheds light on who you are as a designer. Your explanation should be clear and accessible. (Imagine that you’re explaining it to a 10-year-old).

For the “why does this matter” question, use it as an opportunity to showcase your passion for the company’s approach to design. You can also use it to tell a story that provides context for your own design perspective and focuses on the importance of human-centered experiences.

When answering the “How would you explain the UX design process?“ question, focus on each of the following areas:

Tip: Focus your definition of UX design around empathy and the importance of understanding the people you are designing for. This usually means that as a UX designer you should strive to design surveys and interview users to harness data.

When explaining your design process, you can either describe your potential approach to a typical project (good), or you can explain how you’ve done it in the past on other projects (better). Walk your interviewer through your project(s) by using stories:

Don’t be afraid if your process isn’t the same as that of other designers. What does matter is your ability to explain the rationale behind your approach.

Tip: It’s a good idea to talk about a user-centered approach to design, which follows a thorough understanding of both user and business goals. But it’s more powerful to mention it in context of a specific project.

You’ll probably want to touch on each of the following techniques in context of your project(s):

Your interviewer wants to get a sense of your working style. Design is a team sport and, as a UX designer, it’s crucial that you know how to effectively communicate design decisions with the team from the beginning of the project right through to implementation.

Keep in mind that each team member probably sees a given project through different contextual lenses, but you need be able to communicate with all of them to quickly spot any problems or misunderstandings.

The ability to empathize and understand the motivations of those around you is crucial. Developers, PMs, and other designers will all come with their own particular needs and goals, and if you can demonstrate that you’re listening to all of them, you’ll be well received:

Tip: When responding to this question, ask your interviewer to describe the current team structure, roles, and existing processes. Ask for any issues they’re currently facing. You can frame your experience in terms of solving their problems. Let the interviewer see how passionate you are about bringing your skills and experience not just to the position but to the company itself.

This is a really hard question to answer because it is very dependent on context. If the question is asked in context of building a new piece of software, you can talk about how an MVP (minimum viable product) could be developed.

If the question is asked in context of an existing product, you should focus on the fundamentals of product strategy. Before drilling down on specific features, you will need to develop a clear picture of the business goals and user needs. You should be ready to answer the following questions:

Tip: This is also a great time to show how you would use user research to validate design decisions. Often, when faced with a challenge, gathering a lot of user-generated data can help move a designer forward. Once enough data has been collected and the user’s goals have been validated, you can determine which new features are best aligned with business goals, and ultimately, how the features will be prioritized.

This is a tricky question because it puts candidates at ease, which, in turn lets the interviewer ask follow-up questions that dig into process, thinking, and interactions with other team members. It allows the interviewer to assess the candidate’s depth and skill without directly asking about it. As a result, it’s best to keep your answer truthful and clear. Don’t exaggerate your contribution to a project.

Tip: Note that the question here doesn’t contain the word “UX.” It’s perfectly OK to step into the wider realms of your life in your answer.

First things first, do not pretend that you’ve never had such a project. Making mistakes is a normal part of work life. What’s critical is how you handle them. You need to find an honest example that shows:

Tip: The key is to acknowledge your weakness and then offer a reason that you could turn it into a strength. We all learn from our mistakes.

Use this question as an opportunity to demonstrate your passion for UX design and its future potential. Here are a couple of topics you could focus on: The rise of new prototyping tools that save developers and designers time by converting design to code. Designing for accessibility that allows users of all abilities to navigate, understand, and use your UI successfully.

Tip: This question is also a great opportunity to talk about use cases beyond screens (i.e. Virtual reality/Augmented reality).

Talk about the blogs and books you read, the conferences you’ve attended, and industry leaders that you follow.

And here is a recommended reading list for anyone who wants to learn or deepen their knowledge in UX:

You might be wondering why this list doesn’t include the ubiquitous “Why should I hire you?” question. It’s because I don’t have a guide for how to answer it. You have to figure it out for yourself. The only thing I would say is: Be honest with yourself. Have a clear idea of why you’d want to work for the company, because, ultimately, your enthusiasm (or lack of it) will come through.|||
