The past few months have been a humbling time for Samsung. The Galaxy Note 7's explosive debut and double recall eventually led to an unprecedented cancellation of Samsung's flagship device. The recall process and resulting investigation kept the company's name in the mud for months and months. Memes were created across the Internet, property was damaged, and everyone visiting an airport was constantly reminded that Samsung produced a faulty device. To top it all off, the head of Samsung Group and several other Samsung executives were indicted on corruption allegations, with at least one person resigning as a result.

Now Samsung is ready to move on from those dark times with the launch of a new flagship, the Galaxy S8. It has a lot riding on the S8's success, and the company seems ready to rise to the occasion. The S8 is one of Samsung's strongest flagship offerings ever, with an all-new design, slim bezels, and the debut of a speedy new processor. Since this is a Samsung flagship, it will also be backed by dump trucks full of marketing dollars ensuring it will be featured in every commercial break, be on every billboard, and have prime real estate at every electronics store.

We're here to cut through the hype, though, and while Samsung has done a commendable revamp of its flagship smartphone, there are a few issues that might give people pause.|||
