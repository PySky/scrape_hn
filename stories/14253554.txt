The Kubernetes community prioritizes safety, transparency and authenticity through RESPECT of all people and their contributions to the project.

Issues raised since Friday about potential new contributors have become pressing enough to warrant both IMMEDIATE action and long term planning. We prize transparency and openness and so are communicating what we can now.

Regarding the concern of specific new members to our community who may have exhibited behaviors not in accordance with our Code of Conduct in other communities, please know we take enforcement of our code of conduct seriously.  Reports by our community members of current and prior bad behaviors will be weighed as part of our action, if any.

I [Sarah] am gathering information today and tomorrow with an intent to make a decision regarding any action.  If you have relevant first hand experiences, please reach out to me directly (sarahn...@google.com).  My decision will be reviewed in 6-12 months by the Code of Conduct Committee outlined below.

As a sustainable response to any future Code of Conduct concerns, the Governance Bootstrap group have decided that the Kubernetes project will immediately create a Code of Conduct Committee and the Kubernetes project, through the recommendations of the committee, will have exclusive rights to remove people from our community via temporary or permanent revocations of, but not limited to, GitHub access, git commit access, mailing list access, slack organization access, etc. The Code of Conduct Committee will also help guide community norms on lesser infractions.  Volunteers for this committee will be vetted by the bootstrap group in the absence of the ongoing and community elected Steering Committee expected as an outcome of the Bootstrap process we're undergoing now.

We know that all of the Kubernetes community supports efforts to keep K8s a respectful and gracious community.  Thank you,|||
