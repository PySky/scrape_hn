As you know, I am a big fan of Selenium WebDriver. You can find tonnes of useful code in my WebDriver Series. I lead automated testing courses and train people how to write tests all the time. The thing that I felt that is missing in the materials was a sheet containing all of the most relevant code snippets. If you google it, you will find several similar cheat sheets (Java, Python), but the C# one was missing. So I decided to fill that gap. So, I created the first and most complete Selenium WebDriver C# cheat sheet. I hope that you will find it useful. Enjoy!|||
