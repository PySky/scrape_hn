Facebook is looking to hire someone to head up its news products, a significant new role charged with helping to combat the proliferation of so-called fake news on its service.

Facebook is talking to veterans of both the tech and media industries, according to multiple sources, but is having trouble finding someone with both the news and technology chops necessary to fill the role.

The position, which reports up into Fidji Simo, Facebook’s VP in charge of news and video, isn’t listed on the company’s website.

But sources say that whoever takes the job will help Facebook create news products for its media partners, like Instant Articles, as well as exploring ways to curb the spread of misinformation.

This is a different job from the one claimed by Campbell Brown, the veteran TV journalist Facebook hired in January to lead the company’s news partnerships team, a narrowly focused role that largely entails communicating with various news organizations.

Facebook’s efforts to curb misinformation have grown significantly since the U.S. presidential election. Critics blamed Facebook for helping to spread false news campaigns that some believe may have impacted the election’s outcome.

In recent months, the company has created mechanisms to try to limit misinformation, including flagging inaccurate news stories and working with third-party fact checkers.|||

The new role is proving hard to fill.
