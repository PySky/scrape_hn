Watching TV and Tweeting are synonymous, especially during an exciting live event, and having a conversation on Twitter  with other viewers from around the world truly enhances the TV experience. From now on you will be able to watch Twitter live video streaming on your big screen TV using a Roku device.

The Twitter channel is available today on Roku streaming players and Roku TV, and you don’t need a Twitter account to stream live video. Twitter’s TV-based video app is already available on Apple TV, Xbox One, and Amazon’s Fire TV devices.

The channel features live streaming video available on Twitter, which includes original programming and live simulcasts in sports, entertainment, news, and politics. Additionally, people can browse commentary via the Twitter timeline as they watch live events.

The expansion comes the same week Twitter annouced multiple partnerships with programmers, like a 24-hour news stream from Bloomberg, in a big video push. According to Twitter, the social media company transmitted around 800 hours of livestreaming content to 45 million viewers in the first part of 2017.

Roku has a huge install base and a relatively captive audience as compared to its rivals including Netflix.|||
