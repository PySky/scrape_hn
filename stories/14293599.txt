The Akamai Connector for Varnish is a VMOD that transparently syncs Varnish cache configuration and purges to the Akamai platform using VCL (Varnish Configuration Language).

This allows you to communicate caching rule changes, issue and synchronize purge requests, and defer ESI processing to the Akamai platform, as well as applying best practice Akamai settings at origin, and making it easier to work with device characteristics by parsing the inbound EDC header into a VCL object.

The Akamai Connector will automatically add headers with the appropriate attribute that correctly handles the Varnish grace period. This eliminates race conditions between the Edge and Varnish which can result in Varnish serving stale objects to the Edge which are then cached. The Connect will also push Edge Side Include (ESI) processing out to the Edge by sending a attribute along with the header.

The Akamai Connector will also remove extraneous (non- ) headers which can cause the Edge to cache too many variants of an object resulting in excessive cache misses.

When a request is received from the Edge, the Connector will set the header correctly, as well as parse the Akamai Device Characteristics header in to a more useable VCL object. Each element of the will be available via , for example the value of will be available as the header.

Additionally, the Connector will automatically respond with a static test object for SureRoute tests, avoiding an unnecessary trip to origin.

All of these features are enabled by default by including the configuration in your VCL configuration. They can be configured and tweaked just like any other VCL option.|||
