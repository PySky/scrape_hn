In a previous project, I showed how to train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify food images using Keras/Tensorflow. We also saw how to export the model to Keras.js for use in a HTML5/Javascript browser application.

For this next writeup, I'll show how to take the same model and prepare it for use in a mobile app. I only have experience with iOS devices and only have an iPhone for testing, but the process of extracting, modifying, and serializing the computation graphs should apply for Android deployments as well.

Here is a video capture of the app running on my development device, an iPhone 5s. BTW, all food in the screenshots and video are vegan! ;)|||

Creating a Deep Learning iOS App with Keras and Tensorflow Take the Food Classifier that we trained last time around and export and prepare it to be used in an iPhone app for real-time classification.
