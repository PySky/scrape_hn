The point isn’t to scare you about your regular camera usage. (Norton suggests you can avoid the majority of camera attacks by sensibly avoiding suspicious emails and suspicious links).

But if we accept there is always some risk of attack if a device has a camera then, for most of us, our sex life is one place where that risk is not welcome.

Norton, for example, suggests keeping your webcam out of the bedroom to reduce the risk of blackmail – your boring face staring at a screen isn’t worth much to a criminal, after all.

But, as we’ve seen with the rise of revenge porn, there are plenty of people willing to exploit, watch and share your most intimate moments without your consent.

Today, security firm Pen Test Partners is warning that one device, the Siime Eye vibrator, could be easily hacked – giving cybercriminals complete control over the device and its recordings.

More widely, if you can’t trust cameras in Windows or Apple products, you certainly can’t assume that products made by small and poorly regulated sex toy companies are going to be secure.

By all means get an internet-connected vibrator.|||

Please, steer clear of sex toy cameras - no one wants their most intimate moments hacked.
