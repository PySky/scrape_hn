In August 2016, we announced the HTTP/2 support for Azure CDN from Akamai. Today, we are pleased to announce that HTTP/2 is also available for all customers using Azure CDN from Verizon. No further action is required from customers. HTTP/2 is on by default, for all existing and new Azure CDN profiles with no additional fees.

HTTP/2 is designed to improve webpage loading speed and optimize user experience. You will start enjoying the benefits of HTTP/2 without the need to update any of your code base today!|||
