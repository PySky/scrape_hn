Boston and its surroundings are full of distinctive neighborhoods, but their extents and boundaries are open to interpretation. The goal of this site is to collectively map neighborhoods as an image of the city in maps and words.

No neighborhood names or boundaries are here to start with. You make the map. Real or imagined, within a city, or crossing municipal borders. Names, extents, and descriptions are up to you. After mapping, be sure to View Maps to see other people's contributions.

This is a project by Bostonography â€” read more about it here!|||
