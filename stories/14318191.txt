Durham Goode is the tech lead on the Source Control team at Facebook. Facebook uses Mercurial to host some of the largest, fastest growing distributed version control repositories in the world. Over the past four years, they've dealt with numerous scaling challenges, ranging from the number of commits per minute to creating robust, redundant server infrastructure. Facebook has also introduced significant user experience improvements to make it easier to ramp up new engineers and to make power-user workflows more accessible to everyone.



In this session, Durham will talk about the specific technical and user experience improvements Facebook has open sourced to handle their growing scale, with an emphasis on the lessons learned that could be valuable to Git and the Git community.
