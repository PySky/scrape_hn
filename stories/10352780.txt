In this video we'll create an actual portfolio website, step by step, from start to finish. The site is designed to be minimalistic and clean, with a Pinterest-style grid for displaying images, posts, and videos. It's the perfect site for photographers, designers, and other professionals to showcase their work. 



WordPress is perfect for building a portfolio website. You’ll be able to get the site up and running quickly, adding content is a cinch, and you can maintain everything on the site on your own. We’ll be using Fukasawa WordPress theme, which is incredibly beautiful, easy to use, and best of all… it’s free :)
