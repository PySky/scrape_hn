The purpose of a map is to get you from point A to point B.  There are three key areas to look at on a map:

When setting a goal, you’ll focus on question 2 primarily. Where would you like to get to?  Understanding what goals, you would like to accomplish with your business will help you reach a higher potential than if you just “go for it”. You don’t need to set a goal to climb the highest mountain, but you should aspire for something that will stretch you. Here are some questions to consider when planning your business goal:

A failure to plan is essentially a plan to fail.  Planning is vital to the success of your business.  However, do not get paralysis by analysis. Simplify your plan whenever possible and make quick, educated decisions.  I have fallen into the trap over over-planning so many times.  So, remember K.I.S.S. (Keep it Simple, Stupid), and don’t over-complicate your plan, but don’t forget to plan either.

Your goals will change.  Your plans will change.  Your business model may even adapt over time to fit your needs and the needs of your customers.  Continually set goals and make plans as you grow with your business.  Sticking to the same plan will surely stunt your potential growth. However, don’t stray so far that your business changes entirely!  If you’re the expert in teaching others to write children’s novels you won’t want to be transitioning into someone who sells their handmade beanies.

It’s smart to revisit your goals on a yearly or even quarterly basis to make sure you are still headed in the direction you want.  Obviously, you will check your progress towards your goals more often (monthly, weekly, or daily), but change them when you need.|||

Much like a map guides you on a trip, a business roadmap will also outline the path your business should take as you progress from start to empire.
