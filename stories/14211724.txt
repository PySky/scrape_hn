Python to python compiler that allows you to use some Python 3.6 features in older versions, you can try it in the online demo.

Requires Python 3.3+ to run, can compile down to 2.7.

For example, if you have some python 3.6 code, like:

You can compile it for python 2.7 with:

Got some ugly code and ensure that it works:

For testing compiled code with each supported python version you can use tox and tox-py-backwards. You need to install them:

First of all, you need to inherit from , (if you want to use NodeTransfromer interface), or (if you want just to change import).

If you use , override class method , like:

If you use , override methods, for simplification this class have a whole tree in , you should also set if the tree was changed:

If you use , just override , like:

After that you need to add your transformer to .

It's hard to write code in AST, because of that we have snippets:

And you can easily get content of snippet with:

Also please look at tree utils, it contains such useful functions like , and etc.|||
