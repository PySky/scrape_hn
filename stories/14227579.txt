This is a quick demo of eclair, our own implementation of Lightning, on Litecoin (testnet).



To run the demo, you wll need:

- a synchronized Litcoin node, with zmq notifications enable (which is easily available on linux only at the moment)

- our eclair node, which you can find there: https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair



We created 3 directories (one for each node) with 3 different eclair.conf files, started all 3 nodes and connected A to B and B to C.
