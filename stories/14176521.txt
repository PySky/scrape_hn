The European Commission is considering grant applications for video game projects that are creative, innovative and promote cultural diversity. The developers must have their primary ambition to sell the game within the European markets.

There is no set minimum amount that each project receives, but the grant may only cover up to 50% of the proposed budget. The entire fund contains 2.5 million EUR.|||
