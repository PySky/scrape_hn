How He Was Hooked

In 1931, the Chandlers and their two daughters set sail for France, where Douglas would discover two new passions: photography and Nazism. He soon purchased a Leica camera and began a career as a freelancer. Then he visited Germany for the first time, where—according to historian John Carver Edwards’ book Berlin Calling: American Broadcasters in Service to the Third Reich—he was introduced to the Nazi Press Department’s attaché and the general consul in Munich. The latter took him on a tour of Dachau, one of the Nazi’s first concentration camps, where Chandler was impressed by the clean barracks. He left convinced that U.S. authorities were distorting conditions in Germany.|||
