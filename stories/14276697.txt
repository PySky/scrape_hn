OpenPSA is a management suite for web agencies and consultants that provides a unified interface for handling many common business processes. It is built on a component architecture that makes it easy to integrate new components for specific requirements and is available as free software under the terms of the LGPL license.

The currently active branch (OpenPSA 9) is developed and supported by CONTENT CONTROL.
