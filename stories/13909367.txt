The Gluu Server is a free open source identity and access management (IAM) platform. Most of the software included in the Gluu Server is written in Java. The most common use case for the Gluu Server is Single Sign-On (SSO). Other common use cases include mobile authentication, API access management, two-factor authentication, customer identity and access management (CIAM), and identity federation.

The Gluu Server is a container distribution composed of software written by Gluu and incorporated from other open source projects. Gluu projects are frequently prefixed with our open source handle: ox (e.g. oxAuth, oxTrust).

During installation you have the option to install multiple components. Each fulfills a different requirement. The only required components are oxAuth, oxTrust, and Gluu LDAP. An overview of each follows:

Note: All software included in the Gluu Server is free open source software, with no restrictions about use in production systems. See licenses here.

SaaS, custom, open source and commercial software can be made more secure by leveraging a central authentication and authorization service. Because there are so many different kinds of apps, there is no way to “top down” implement proprietary security mechanisms. This is why open standards are so important for IAM.

The Gluu Server is like a router for authentication and authorization. It speaks multiple dialects of SSO, and can help an organization manage both inbound and outbound authentication and authorization requirements. The Gluu Server is flexible enough to enforce any policy you can script and can be scaled to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes.|||
