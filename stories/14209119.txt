GitPitch is a service that turns PITCHME.md markdown into online and offline, interactive slideshows. You can use it to promote, pitch or present anything from designs and best practices, to code snippets and complete frameworks.

Each slideshow presentation is made instantly available online just as soon as you git-commit and push PITCHME.md on any branch within a public GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repo.

GitPitch is an open source project so you can fork, clone, and modify the source. You can find detailed build instructions here. You can also submit bug, feature and pull-requests on this repo. If you like this project please show your support with a GitHub star. Much appreciated.
