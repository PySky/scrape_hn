I tried to convey as much information in the title as possible with 300 characters, but here a bit more information:

Due to our somewhat outdated laws and guidelines concerning anything technology related, the Landesmedienanstalt has temporarily ruled that live-streaming requires a Rundfunklizenz (broadcasting license), which costs between 1000€ and 10000€, depending on audience size and other factors.

If this wasn't troubling enough, there are other implications: If live-streaming has to abide by the same guidelines and regulations as television does in Germany, then you will no longer be allowed to stream violent and other Jugendgefährdende material (material harmful to young persons) before 10pm. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you would furthermore have to aquire the services of a Jugendschutzbeauftragten (youth protection commissioner?) who ensures that you do follow all the regulations that are in place.

If you didn't follow these rules and continued to broadcast without license, you'd effectively be a pirate station, which is a criminal offense.

I however wasn't able to find out what the actual punishment would be, pirate stations are so uncommon that even in the TV and radio field there are next to no rulings, let alone about things on the internet.

The Landesmedienanstalt has also stated that the guidelines are in need of an update, as cases like this weren't considered when they were originally written, meaning that this ruling might be changed in the future.

Basically, they have to rule this way at the moment, because they can't afford to set a precedent which would allow TV and radio stations to later ditch paying for their own Rundfunklizenz while pointing at this ruling.

However, until that happens, this ruling is absolutely legal, as they are following the current word of the law.|||
