Here are examples of applications addressed in Coding the Matrix.

 



Error-correcting codes

 

 

 

 Error-correcting codes are used, e.g., by cellphones to preserve data transmitted over a noisy channel while maintaining high throughput.



Integer factorization

 

 

 

 

 Factoring an integer is a hard computational problem (and the RSA cryptosystem depends on it being hard).  At the core of the most sophisticated integer-factoring algorithms is a simple problem in linear algebra.

Searching within an image

 

   

 

 Convolution can also be done in two dimensions, enabling one to quickly search for a subimage within an image.



Audio and image compression

 

 Compression of audio and images aids efficient storage and transmission.  Lossy compression techniques such as those used in MP3 (audio) and JPEG (images) are based in part on linear algebra,

 e.g. wavelet transform and Fourier transform.
