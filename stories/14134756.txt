Snapchat is making headlines again, this time after alleged comments by CEO Evan Spiegel that the app is “only for rich people” and that he didn’t “want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.” While Snap Inc. has dismissed the allegations, people in India are deleting the app and leaving 1 star reviews on the App Store. The only problem is that some of the people protesting Snapchat have attacked Snapdeal, an Amazon- or Flipkart-like store which has nothing to do with Snapchat.

Twitter naturally has become the main avenue for witty comments and trolling those who mistakenly mocked Snapdeal instead of Snapchat

Guy on Snapchat DM.

"Bro, you need to take a stance like me. And uninstall Snapdeal." Bro, you should learn how to read. A little.

Some of the people who can indeed differentiate Snapdeal from Snapchat, decided to let their frustrations and anger out by commenting on Instagram photos of Miranda Kerr, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel’s fiancee and a world-famous top model.

Some of the model’s fans jumped in to defend Miranda Kerr and apologized on behalf of those who ‘misrepresented India’ by leaving derogatory comments:

The claim about Evan Spiegel’s comments about India and Spain comes from Anthony Pompliano, who worked at Snapchat as a growth lead for a few weeks in 2015.

In a statement for Business Insider, Snapchat representative said: “This is ridiculous. Obviously, Snapchat is for everyone! It’s available worldwide to download for free. Those words were written by a disgruntled former employee. We are grateful for our Snapchat community in India and around the world.”
