A while ago, one of my fans said that I should try and play a bunch of football matches in games just to see what the A.I would do. How good would my team defend if I wasn't controlling them? How long would it take for the other team to score? This seems to be straightforward, but as evidenced from the football games I played here - a whole mixture of stuff from oldies like Sensi to new games like FIFA 17 - the results can vary pretty wildly! Enjoy.
