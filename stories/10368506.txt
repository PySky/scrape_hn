This has a benefit of having a "memory" of past changes, allowing you to use snapshots of the volume to restore files from a past point of time should anything go wrong.

Note that a snapshot is not back up of your data and if your volume goes down, so will your snapshots. Snapshots are meant to be used if files accidentally get corrupted or deleted. One can simply backtrack a few hours (or whatever frequency you set them at) and restore the broken/missing files.

Another one of my favorite features of Btrfs is that it has its own native RAID support built in called Btrfs-RAID. One of the biggest benefits of how Btrfs does its RAID is that a RAID6 volume does not need any additional re-syncing upon creation of the RAID. Using Linux RAID, “mdadm”, the initial build of a 258TB RAID6 (that’s a Storinator S45 filled with 6TB drives), can take up to two days depending on your system. You can also add disks into a mounted Btrfs-RAID live with a single command, and not only that, but you can also convert non-raid mounted device into a Btrfs-RAID just as easily. Rockstor makes all of this painless through its management interface, but if you would like to learn more, check out this link on Btrfs-RAID|||
