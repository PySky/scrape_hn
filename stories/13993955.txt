Here's a dirty little secret: working as a team is really hard, and tools alone won't fix that. Books wax poetic about Silicon Valley dream-teams, but they don't tell you how to start improving your team. That's why we developed a playbook that changed the way our teams work. Now it's yours to try, too.

This ain't your CEO's ivory-tower management book. And it's not the generic "team building" activities we all know and loathe. The Team Playbook is by teams, for teams. You'll find step-by-step guides for tracking your team's health, and plays that build your Get $#!τ Done™ muscle. Start with a Health Monitor workshop to get a reading on your vital signs, or just dive straight into the plays.|||

Forget trust falls and ropes courses. These are activities for building your team&#039;s Get $#!τ Done muscle and working better together.
