The low cost and eco-friendly memory was created from a hybrid of graphene oxide and titanium oxide, and are suited for use in flexible electronic devices, such as bendable mobile phone, computer and television screens, and intelligent clothing.

"Using graphene oxide to produce memory devices has been reported before, but they were typically large, slow, and aimed at the 'cheap and cheerful' end of the electronics goods market,‚Äù said Professor David Wright.

"Our hybrid graphene oxide-titanium oxide memory is, in contrast, just 50nm long and 8nm thick and can be written to and read from in less than 5ns."

According to the researchers, the devices may also have the potential to offer a cheaper and more adaptable alternative to flash memory, which is currently used in many common devices such as memory cards, graphics cards and USB computer drives.|||

A technique to produce quick, small, high capacity memories for flexible and transparent applications has been developed by engineers from the University of Exeter.
