A tool to dump the login password from the current linux desktop user. Adapted from the idea behind the popular Windows tool mimikatz.

Takes advantage of cleartext credentials in memory by dumping the process and extracting lines that have a high probability of containing cleartext passwords. Will attempt to calculate each word's probability by checking hashes in /etc/shadow, hashes in memory, and regex searches.

MimiPenguin is slowly being ported to multiple languages to support all possible post-exploit scenarios. The roadmap below was suggested by KINGSABRI to track the various versions and features. An "X" denotes full support while a "~" denotes a feature with known bugs.|||
