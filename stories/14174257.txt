A potential buyer has come forward to purchase the tiny Oregon town of Tiller, which was put up for sale for $3.5 million last month.

The asking price of the southwestern 256-acre community includes six houses, commercial lots and a building that used to be a gas station and store. For another $350,000, the Tiller Elementary School, a six-classroom building that closed in 2014, is also available. Tiller, which is about 225 miles south of Portland, has just two residents excluding the family selling it, according to TIME .

Now the Associated Press has reported that a potential buyer has come forward, but they are remaining anonymous, and backup offers are still being accepted. "I started getting inquiries from all over the world, essentially, 'What was it? And what could you do with it?'," Richard Caswell, executor of the estate, told The Canadian Press . "It's the buyer and their imagination that's going to determine what Tiller can become."|||
