We have a really exciting announcement for the users of both NativeBase and Ignite.

We have worked up on a project in collaboration with the team at Infinite Red which enables you to create an Ignite boilerplate with NativeBase screens.

Gant Laborde from Infinite Red has just announced it in his presentation at React Amsterdam.

Here’s the link to the Github project, https://github.com/GeekyAnts/ignite-native-base-boilerplate

You can run the following command to create the boilerplate, provided you have Ignite CLI installed.

It’s at a nascent stage but you can definitely try it out.|||
