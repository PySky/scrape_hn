This notepad application is so lightweight it saves and reads text to and from just one file.

 With almost no user interface it works great as a place to keep your notes in.

It was built to replace a giant collection of small paper notes scattered all over my workspace and home.

 Comes in handy as a to-do list. Can also help you keep those pretty Japanese smileys at hand.

Placing a file named into will serve as a custom stylesheet for the program.

 Use default.qss as a reference.

This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.|||
