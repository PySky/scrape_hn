Athletic performance enhancement is as simple as going to bed with EarthPulse™ PEMF under your mattress. EarthPulse™ PEMF provides multi-dimensional biohacking, not just athletic performance enhancement. A combination of physical and mental performance enhancement.

EarthPulse™ PEMF enhances deep-sleep and radically accelerates short and long-term recovery on both physical and psychological levels; while synergistically providing the most potent ergogenic, adaptogenic, anti-catabolic sports performance enhancing effects ever reported.

If EarthPulse™ PEMF didn’t work as well as we say it does, we’d have been out of business long ago. Our 90-day satisfaction guarantee represents the most lenient return policy in the PEMF device sector, yet returns for failure is just 5% over the past 5 years. Set PR’s in your sports training in 30 days or less, or return it!

Anything that can enhance athletic sports performance to the levels that we guarantee are either banned or illegal. Period. End of story.

There are no,… I repeat NO  biohacking techniques that come close to EarthPulse™ either. Certainly not tDCS – transcranial direct current stimulation or any other types of electric stimulation, or vibration plates, or 3-D gaming for tuning-up reflexes, fine-tuning motor control, or increasing strength, stamina or accelerating repair. Put all those technologies together and you still won’t even come close to EarthPulse™ PEMF. Hypoxic training takes time and effort. You do this in your sleep. Can you handle that?

The Olympic Baseball player in this short video had incredible things to say about his very first EarthPulse™ session taken right beside the batting cages and how it immediately impacted batting performance and hand-eye coordination. Over 10 days his peak strength increased close to 20%.

The second video interviews a full-contact, mixed martial arts fighter reporting incredible effects on speed, punching accuracy, and strength. When asked about his punching accuracy responded…  “I can catch a butterfly in a wind storm.” Reported sparring at next heavier weight class because guys he used to spar with seemed “small”. These videos are old…our 2016 v5 systems are better than ever.

The EarthPulse™ Athletic Performance Enhancement Guarantee: our EarthPulse™ ergogenic PEMF system will increase your peak strength by 10% & stamina by 20% within just 7 – 10 days. Peak strength measured by increase in resistance in 1-3 rep set. Stamina measured by added reps to previous 8-10 rep resistance lelvel.

Earthpulse™ PEMF will increase your VO2 Max by 1% in 7-10 days, up to 3% by the end of 90 days or your money back. If you run a field or a court you’ll run back and forth like you did have the 3rd lung Carl mentioned. You’ll beat your opponents by attrition!

And if EarthPulse™ PEMF helps you repair an old nagging issue that’s been holding you back, gains will be a lot greater than that. For example only, we include this on-point 90-day case study of a recent EarthPulse™ PEMF client.

“My sleep has hit an all time high. At first, I was skeptical how it would work on my elbow, but after a recent x-ray (15-4-2016) the 3.2mm loose ossified bodies are GONE! No surgery necessary!! Absolutely outstanding improvements. 90 days ago struggling to get 2 repetitions of the 32kg kettlebell. 80 days later and I can now clean and press two 32kg kettlebells for 5 reps. I have been able to do a large volume of presses without any trouble.”



Listen to this 49 y.o. power lifter with 600 lb bench press in competition, describe adding 100 lbs to his bench press in just 3 weeks. Perfectly healthy chest and training for that 600 lb competition lift repping 450 lbs ”out of chains”. After 3 weeks of EarthPulse™ repping 550 lbs out of chains for same-number of reps; by the end of 90-days his lumbar so much improved he was deadlifting again.

EarthPulse™ increases strength to weight ratio, speed, reaction time; improves hand-eye-motor coordination, mental focus; radically improves your “wind-under-load”; radically accelerates short and long term recovery mechanisms for years on end. The ergogenic, adaptogenic and anabolic performance enhancing and accelerated repair mechanisms are due to improved cellular respiration and subsequently More-ATP.

An additional 10% strength and 20% stamina during months 2 – 3 for a total of 20% peak strength and 40% stamina over baseline! With NO weight-gain. There’s nothing on Earth that can affect strength to weight ratio as much as EarthPulse™ PEMF. These secondary boosts are due to some unidentified adaptogenic mechanism. At least in part. Breath-hold continues to rise for months if not years, thus indicating continuing mitochondrial morphogenesis at least until breath-hold peaks. So, it is entirely possible that mitochondrial morphogenesis is responsible for any perceived adaptogenic effects. It may be that by continually pushing your training limits, you can get the most athletic performance enhancement from the EarthPulse™ PEMF system. 



EarthPulse™ ergogenic PEMF used regularly during nighttime for athletic performance enhancement is a more powerful ergogenic aid than steroids, EPO (blood doping), altitude or hypoxic training or by ANY other means whether legal, banned or flat out illegal. PERIOD. EarthPulse™ PEMF is covert and untestable and the best sleep-aid ever created. Small and portable. All you have to do is remember to turn it on. Even professional athletes can handle that.

Many professional athletes own EarthPulse™ systems. We charge them all retail price because once they realize how much of an edge it gives them, very rarely will they risk losing that edge by even talking about it with their teammates. On the other hand, Pro’s are only too happy endorsing the stuff that (dubiously) works. If you read between the lines, you’ll recognize that no professional endoursements means this technology works as well as we say it does.

How much more proof do you need? If EarthPulse™ fails to work on you you simply return it. Simple. If you had a 1 in 10 chance of the gains we’ve described, EarthPulse™ is still the deal of a century since it’s got the 90-day satisfaction guarantee. But with a chance of 10:1 success, you’de be absolutely crazy not to try this.

This next report from a Phd. New client March 2016:

The first was use of a hypoxic duration test with exercise that was mentioned in the Earth Pulse literature— an underwater swim test. I made sure *not* to practice any hypoxic breathing efforts nor do any swimming once I began using the Earth Pulse device. I took two baseline measures before I started on the Earth Pulse and got exactly 25yds both times. There’s a bit of an “anchoring effect” as one is more inclined to hold out harder to reach a complete lap and that was no doubt some of what was going on. After 3 weeks, I tried again two times and hit almost exactly 1.5 laps in the same 25yd pool, about 37 yards. This is a 48% improvement. At 4 weeks I tried again and this time came close to two laps for a total of about 42 yards a 68% improvement. At that point I lost access to that pool due to a career change and move. Parallel to this test I did a breath hold test every two weeks and moved from a starting time of 2:00 minutes even to 3:05 with improvement seen at week two and increasing through week 6. This is a 54%+ improvement!

The second kind of performance metric was very challenging “super slow set” squat sled exercise performed for 8 reps with 10 seconds concentric press and 5 seconds eccentric return for a total of 2 minutes. This kind of high power exercise is known as a VO2-max effort. These hurt, and it’s not uncommon for professional athletes to puke or pass out after a set of these. I have done these in many different forms for many different years and was stuck at a plateau of 6 plates (270 lbs + sled weight of about 50lbs = 320lbs).



After about 2 weeks of using the Earth Pulse, I broke my plateau. I had done nothing else and didn’t change my normal routine in any other way. I set a new goal for myself of 8 plates. As the weeks progressed I hit a new personal record almost every session on the sled squat. At 4 weeks, I hit 8 plates (360lbs + sled weight of 50lbs = 410lbs). This was the goal for my entire year! I was pretty shocked. What was more shocking was that I kept upping the weight, getting a new PR about every other session. I established a new PR of 10 plates! Let me reemphasize that these efforts are at your absolute limit of O2 consumption, once you’re in the deep end of your range, it is impossible to inhale because your thighs are crushing your chest. Because of this and the VO2-max nature or the exercise they are an excellent test of one’s oxygen consuming efficiency. I didn’t just eek out a breakthrough of my plateau. I achieved an accelerated break through that barrier that kept going. As I kept increasing the weight, typically by just 5lbs, I started getting close to my new “long-term” goal of 10 plates. I realized I had a chance of actually hitting the goal at 8 weeks. In the end, I pulled it off, and have since exceeded that.

What’s amazing is the amount of progress in someone who was already trained in this exercise. This is an increase from 320lbs to 500lbs, an increase of over 56% in two months. Obviously, there could be hidden factors in play and this is yet another sample size of n=1, but nonetheless a very interesting result.

EarthPulse™ is a priceless investment in performance regardless of your age or caliber of competition. We’ve substantially improved the strength and stamina of amateur and professional competitors in just about every sport. You may be competing against one of our clients right now without ever suspecting it. EarthPulse™ works so well it’s the most closely guarded secret in professional and amateur sports.

“After 25 years of running races I finally won a race out right, no age group thing, 1st overall. I ran the 5k race on Saturday. I ran faster than I have in over 8 years and I even let up in the race. I was able to put in a surge in the middle of the race to break my competition. On Sunday I ran the half marathon, I won my age group and as a soon to be 60 year old, I was 5th overall out of over 1200 competitors.Thanks again for creating a great product. I used it to help recover from Saturday’s race to Sunday’s race. Saturday’s race was at 1:00pm and the ½ marathon was at 7:00am the next morning (less than 24 hours)!”

“All in all, I feel fantastic! I got the earthpulse for tendonitis. That took a while to resolve but has pretty much done so now. My mood is consistently great. Testosterone levels are definitely consistently up (can be a bit distracting having T levels like years ago huh? 🙂 It’s helped me achieve another goal of getting to 200 lbs at 10% body fat (the weight I’ve listed is first thing in the morning consistently). I’ve plateaued a bit on strength but am not particularly concerned as I have gained approx. 5 kg / 11 lbs of muscle in the last six months (I think it would have been half that without the EP). I think my body is consolidating current strength levels, but it’s wonderful for motivation to know I am able to keep getting stronger. Injuries are getting better, T-levels are higher, strength is up. I’m coming up for 45 but feel like I can celebrate taking a few years off! My next-day ‘delayed’ agitation has virtually gone. I can use the EP with full strength with minimal if any agitation now. However, I still choose to use it at a moderate level. Great product. Thanks Paul.”

Beyond peak performance! This PEMF ergogenic aid will have you setting personal performance records in weeks and then setting them again and again. No matter if you’re 19 y.o,…or 90.

EarthPulse™ PEMF during sleep is a more potent ergogenic aid for enhanced athletic  performance than anything reported in the scientific literature.  Our PEMF system is designed to last at least 5 years and will save you a TON on your training and nutritional supplements, paying for itself in the first 3-12 months depending on your supplements regimen. Nothing enhances sports performance like EarthPulse™.

From Dan a long-time v4 client and avid kick-boxer / instructor reporting on his v.4 to v5Pro upgrade:

“First night on the 5Pro version, slept really good. I measure my HRV with Sweetwater everyday, so saw an increase this day. Will keep you posted on the process. Thanks for the quick delivery.”

“My HRV is going up, or stay the same everyday, allowing me to train if I want. Before while using the v4, I’ve been using the sweet water HRV app for a month. Only allowing me to train light every other day, it only allowed me to train normal 3 times in that time! Since I got the Pro I’ve been allowed to train normal/hard everyday. Big difference in sleep on the new recovery mode.”

“I’m using the app with a chest strap polar H7, every morning for measuring the HRV. It is the best one, you’ll see differences in both parasympathetic and sympathetic difference. So you get a correct measuring what’s happening in your body. I’m still doing those 16-17hrs a day, with 9hrs normal job and after that I teach a couple hrs 4 times per week. So it seems to recover me much greater, the older version is not even close to this. And you know how much I loved the EarthPulse before. Will keep your posted.”

“Thursdays we have a pad session, where I’m holding pads nonstop for 45 minutes, switching between 2 fighters. They rest for 1 minute, while the one works with me, I don’t rest. So that is high-intensity training, every Friday morning since I started measuring the HRV(4weeks) it’s been down at least 20 points on Friday mornings when you measure it. And it takes the whole weekend to recover the HRV from these sessions. This Friday morning was the first one sleeping on the Pro Thursday night. It dropped 3 points!! And I’m back to normal today. Steroid PEMF! thanks Paul”

“Hi Paul, I still haven’t had one day were the HRV didn’t allow me to train as usual since I got the new Pro! On Monday I have had a full weekend of rest, it flew up 20 points! Over the week it slowly went down, but I was still allowed to train “as usual” every day. Take in to account that I, get up 05 in the morning, and get home at 9.30-9,45 in the evening 4 times a week. And yesterday I did this pad holding session again, on top of that I did 10 sets for 3s of heavy deadlifts. Just checked the app in the morning with 6 hrs of sleep, it went up from 66 to 75!!”

We offer our RBH (Resting-Breath-Hold) test as proof of enhanced oxygen metabolism (more ATP from each breath of air). Athletic performance enhancment using Ergogenic PEMF will make you feel like you’ve grown a 3rd lung.  We guarantee you can raise your waking saturated blood oxygen level 1 – 2% over a weekend just by sleeping; or 3-5% in 10 days if you’re 94% or less at baseline either due to poor health or altitude.

The chart at left was compiled at 6000 Ft Altitude. We’ve collected RBH data on 100’s or our clients since 2006. This data PROVES improved cell respiration / oxygen utilization from between 20% to more than 100% in 90 days regardless of whether elderly or athletic. This is unprecedented in the scientific literature. Drawing O2 from blood slower results in higher saturated blood and tissue oxygen.

Case Study: Two professional swimmers with baseline 100% SAO2 increased their resting (static) breath hold by 19% & 20%. Underwater swim (one breath) up by 50% in both from 50M – 75M!  More than twice the increase under load than at rest. Unprecedented in the literature! Impossible by any other technology on Earth. PRICELESS for competitive athletes. One of these two swimmers went undefeated in FINA world cup in 3 events. 21 wins, 21 races, 3 distances x 7 cities. And he hadn’t competed at the 200M distance since college prior to that year at 26 y.o.. He was skeptical too,… at first.

The resting breath-hold test is a low-tech yet quite accurate (give or take 5%) method of testing the mitochondrial rate of oxygen burn and subsequently ATP for the cells. If the same volume of air can sustain the body longer at rest, then mitochondrion are each burning the same volume of oxygen, SLOWER & MORE EFFICIENTLY. Blows hypoxic / altitude training away with no effort whatsoever. If you can process oxygen more efficiently at rest, we’ve found you can enhance athletic performance and in game situations, run circles around the competition.

Curiously, this effect on breath hold is amplified under load. Up to twice the increase than at rest! We’re the best kept secret in sports. If breath hold goes up, mitochondrial efficiency is going up in a linear and direct relationship.

This effect can NOT be measured by saturated blood oxygen where at 99-100% already. Where SAO2 testing 100% in world class athletes, RBH test increased 20% in 45 days; this effect is amplified under load. There isn’t an ergogeic aid on Earth that can accomplish this.

See our Athletic Performance Enhancement experiment emails from Super Human Radio participants below for exceptional results in every one of the participants but for one drop out due to acclimation issues (sleeping worse).
