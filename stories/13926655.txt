Android O introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, a launcher icon can display using a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all icons with the same shape. The new launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen.

You can control the look of your launcher icon by defining 2 layers, consisting of a background and a foreground. You must provide icon layers as drawables in PNG format without masks or background shadows.

Figure 2. Adaptive icons are defined using 2 layers and a mask.

In previous versions of Android, launcher icons were sized at 48 x 48 dp. You must now size your icon layers using the following guidelines.

To add an adaptive icon to an app, begin by updating the attribute in your app manifest to specify a drawable resource. You can also define an icon drawable resource using the attribute. You must only use this attribute if you require a different icon asset for circular masks, if for example the branding of your logo relies on a circular shape. The following code snippet illustrates both of these attributes:

Next you must create alternative drawable resources in your app for use with Android O in . You can then use the element to define the foreground and background layer drawables for your icons. The and inner elements both support the attribute.

If you don’t update your launcher icon with the necessary layers, the icon doesn’t look consistent with other icons that the system UI displays, and doesn’t support visual effects.|||
