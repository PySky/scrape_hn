In the recent Ad blocker related-news, Apple just removed one of the best ad blockers for iOS 9 called Been Choice, this isn’t your typical ad blocker for iOS devices. Users can block ads from social network, inside applications, and browsers like Safari. Along with that, iPhone and iPad users can also choose to earn money by sharing their data and using the ad blocker at the same time.

However, since the application is showing security risk and violation of privacy, Apple has quickly taken it down from their App Store. In order for Been Choice, for example, to share user’s information and data, they have to install some sort of root certificates and this usually done with permissions by users. But for most people, they think that this is just any typical installation and no hesitation, give permission to install these certificates right away.

Root certificates, when not needed on your iPhone or iPad, can steal your information and expose them or share to 3rd party. It’s important that we check how many root certificates are installed on your device and how to remove suspected one.

In case you do not see any settings called Profile from Step 2, it means that you haven’t installed any root certificates yet and there is nothing to worry about. VPN applications usually install root certificates into your device. If you trust your VPN app then you don’t have to remove it.
