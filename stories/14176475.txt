I'm glad that Microsoft isn't wresting on its laurels, but i feel they are failing to understand their clientel.  Most Educational deparments are run by Principals and not your average Tech driven pioneer from a fortune 500 Company.   They have a better grasp of Google because they own Google phones and think that Windows Phone is a Nokia created OS.

For crying out loud no one in my dstrict has a clue that you can run Excel, word or PowerPoint for free by opening a hotmail account.   Our HS Engineering Teacher who runs robotics (loves Excel) didn't even know you could run excel for free.

If Microsoft wants to punch its way into districts, they need to come out with a better strategy.   My first opinion of my Dell touch Chromebooks is that they were a heaping pile of crap.  Then i figured out how to use Symbaloo and now I'm on my way to creating links to (Free) educational software that is made for smart boards.

My biggest problem with Bing and Google is the algorithms they use to search the web.  Its freakin difficult to find touch enabled websites that are educational based.   The first company that figures out how to create an algorithm that locates sites that are touch friendly and can be run from the web will win my vote and millions of educators.  So get to it Microsoft for once beat Google at its own game.|||

Windows 10 Cloud OS combined with new low-cost Surface hardware could help Microsoft jump-start its new focus on education and schools. Here's why.
