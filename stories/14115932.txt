Since February 2017, over 100 male residents of the Chechen Republic (part of the Russian Federation) assumed to be gay or bisexual have been rounded up, detained and tortured by authorities on account of their sexual orientation.[1] These crackdowns have been described as part of a systemic anti-LGBT purge in the region. The men have been held and allegedly tortured in what human rights groups and eyewitnesses have called concentration camps.[2][3]

Allegations were initially reported in Novaya Gazeta on April 1, 2017[4] a Russian-language opposition newspaper, which reported that over 100 men have allegedly been detained and tortured and at least three people have died in an extrajudicial killing. The paper, citing its sources in the Chechen special services, called the wave of detentions a "prophylactic sweep."[4][5] The journalist who first reported on the subject has gone into hiding,[6][7] There have been calls for reprisals for journalists reporting on the situation.[8]

Chechnya and Russian authorities have denied any knowledge about the arrests. In response, the Russian LGBT Network is attempting to assist those who are threatened to evacuate from Chechyna.[9][10] Human rights groups and foreign governments have called upon Russia and Chechyna to put an end to the internments.[11]

That status of LGBT rights in the Chechen Republic has long been a concern among human rights organisations, and has been described as "especially bleak" within the context of the Russian Federation as a whole,[12] and singled out for criticism by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International before the 2017 crackdown.[13] Chechnya, with citizens who mostly come from regions in former Soviet states and the Middle East, is an ultra-conservative society in which homophobia is widespread and homosexuality is taboo, and where having a gay relative is seen as a "stain on the entire extended family."[14]

Many of Russia's LGBT laws apply in Chechnya, which is a part of the Russian Federation. However, Chechnya is a semi-autonomous republic within Russia's borders, with its own legal code. In Chechnya, as in other southern Russia regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has empowered local leaders to enforce their interpretation of traditional values, partly in an effort to co-opt religious extremism, which has largely been driven underground."[15] Although homosexuality was legalized in Russia in 1993,[16] in 1996 Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov adopted sharia law in his Republic, and article 148 of the Chechen penal code made all sodomy punishable by caning on the first two offences and execution on the third offence[13] (although the death penalty in Chechnya has not been carried out since 1999[17]). Although Chechnya returned to Russian direct rule in 2000, it retains some autonomy, and the current Head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, "has brought Islam to the fore of Chechnya's daily life, and gay people who reveal their sexuality are often discriminated against and shunned by their families."[18]

A spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin endorsed Chechen leaders’ claims that anti-gay persecution is not occurring in the republic.[19]

Arrests began after the LGBT rights organization Gayrussia.ru applied for permits to hold gay pride parades in four cities within the Kabardino-Balkar Republic in Russia's predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region, although not within Chechnya itself. The application in this district was denied by the Kabardino-Balkar authorities. An anti-gay demonstration followed, along with posts on social media calling for gay people to be murdered by various methods.[5]

Gayrussia.ru organizer Nikolay Alexeyev dismissed suggestions that attempts to organize pride parades in the region had sparked the violence against gay Chechens as speculative and unfounded.[4] The organization had not focused on the Muslim districts in particular, and had applied for permits for gay pride parades in 90 municipal governments all across Russia in an attempt to collect the inevitable denials, which would be used in a case about freedom of assembly and gay rights before the European Court of Human Rights.[5]

Human Rights Watch reported in 2017 that "it is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to 'honour killings' by their own relatives for tarnishing family honor."[20] Kadyrov has encouraged extrajudicial killings by family members as an alternative to law enforcement – in some cases, gay men in prison have been released early specifically to enable their murder by relatives.[21]

The Chechen police and military have conducted entrapment schemes, in which a victim is lured on a date, beaten and humiliated. A recording is produced, and blackmail money is solicited in return for silence. Law enforcement agencies of Chechnya already keep lists of "suspects".[1] According to a source of Radio Liberty, raids on gays began in December 2016, subsided briefly, and resumed on a large scale in February 2017. The first gay men who were detained via entrapment were tortured in attempts to reveal the names of their acquaintances. All the correspondence in their phone was checked, adding to the "suspect" list. This resulted in the number of victims growing exponentially. According to Novaya Gazeta, at the end of February the police detained and checked the phone of a person who was in a state of intoxication. The phone had "pictures and videos with explicit content" and "dozens of contacts of local homosexuals." The detainee was sent to a "secret prison".[1] Subsequently, a "wave of persecution" began in Chechnya as an attempt to purge the country of those who are homosexual or are perceived to be homosexual.[1][22][23] Chechen police are reportedly pressuring parents in the region to kill their children who they suspect of being homosexual.[24][25]

According to Novaya Gazeta, independent media and human rights groups, homosexuals are sent to clandestine camps in Chechnya, which one eyewitness likened to a concentration camp.[3] Around 100 men have been imprisoned and at least three people have already died. Some of the guards in these allegedly unofficial jails are accused of releasing the prisoners to their relatives if the family promises to kill them. One location of a secret prison is allegedly in the southern city of Argun.[26] Another prison is located in Tsotsin-Yurt, south of the Chechen capital Grozny.[1]

Human Rights Watch has confirmed that authorities have "rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay and torturing and humiliating the victims. Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began."[27] An investigation by Radio Svoboda (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) claimed that prisoners are being released to families if the families promise to murder them.[28]

According to The Guardian, in an interview with an escapee, 30 to 40 people are detained in one room, being beaten and tortured with electricity.[14] In some cases the process of torture ends in the death of the person being tortured.[29][30] An April 7, 2017 press statement by The United States Department of State the expressed concern "about the situation in the Republic of Chechnya, where there have been numerous credible reports indicating the detention".[31]

Due to the date (April 1) of the initial Novaya Gazeta allegations, a spokesman for the region's interior ministry described the report as "an April fool's joke".[32] Alvi Karimov, spokesperson for Ramzan Kadyrov, also rejected the allegations, saying: "you cannot arrest or repress people who just don't exist in the republic", while also adding that "If there were such people in Chechnya, the law-enforcement organs wouldn't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning".[32] Sources have said that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov wants the LGBT community eliminated by 26 May.[33]

On April 14, 2017 Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary for the President of Russia, said "We do not have any reliable information about any problems in this area".[34] The Russian LGBT Network is attempting to evacuate from Chechyna those who are threatened.[9][10] The Canada-based charity Rainbow Railroad announced it is working with the Russian LGBT Network to establish safe routes out of the region and assist at-risk men in escaping.[35]

On May 5, Putin agreed to a proposal by Russia’s human rights ombudsman to form a group to investigate the reports.[36]

In Moscow, on May 10, five activists were arrested while en route to the prosecutor general’s office to deliver a petition calling for an unbiased investigation. [37] According to the Russian LGBT Network, the petition bore more than two million signatures of people in various countries.[38]

On April 4, 2017 Amnesty International called for a prompt investigation and intervention,[39] and more than 130,000 people have signed a petition started by the organization in opposition to alleged human rights violations.[40] The camps became an issue in the 2017 French presidential election, with Jean-Luc Mélenchon, Benoît Hamon and Emmanuel Macron condemning Chechnya for them, while François Fillon and Marine Le Pen remained silent.[41] In the United Kingdom, British MEPs urged Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to meet with the Russian Ambassador.[42] A protest attended by hundreds was held on April 12, 2017, outside the Embassy of Russia in London.[43][44] Julie Bishop, the Australian Foreign Minister, condemned both the arrests and the camps.[45][46]

On April 13, 2017, a panel of five experts that advises the United Nations Human Rights Council called that Chechnya "put an end to the persecution of people perceived to be gay or bisexual in the Chechen Republic who are living in a climate of fear fueled by homophobic speeches by local authorities".[15] Also on April 13, the director of the human rights office at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that Moscow must "urgently investigate the alleged disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment" of gay men in Chechnya.[47] Lilianne Ploumen, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, has called for a statement of condemnation from the 32 members (Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Italy, Mexico, Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay) of the Equal Rights Coalition.[48] In a statement released April 15, 2017 the Government of Canada calling the "persecution of LGBTQ2 people in Chechnya reprehensible", calling upon Russia to investigate and ensure the safety of those at risk.[49]

An April 7, 2017 press statement by the United States Department of State the expressed concern "about the situation in the Republic of Chechnya, where there have been numerous credible reports indicating the detentions and deaths of LGBTI individuals."[31] Fifty members of the United States Congress signed a letter urging Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was in Russia in April to publicly question the validity of the reports and to pressure the Russian government to investigate and put a stop to the arrests.[50] On April 17, 2017, Nikki Haley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, released a statement saying, "We continue to be disturbed by reports of kidnapping, torture, and murder of people in Chechnya based on their sexual orientation and those persecuted by association. If true, this violation of human rights cannot be ignored – Chechen authorities must immediately investigate these allegations, hold anyone involved accountable, and take steps to prevent future abuses."[51] On April 20, 2017, former Secretary of State and 2016 Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton condemned the developments and called on the Trump administration to do the same.[52]

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on April 27 issued a statement[53] condemning the persecution of gay men in Chechnya. In a press release, the museum's director called on Chechen and Russian authorities to investigate the matter and "ensure the safety of LGBT populations within the Russian Federation".[54]

German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the topic in a May 2 meeting with Putin, and urged him to exert his influence to “ensure that minorities’ rights are protected”.[55] The following day, in a joint letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the foreign ministers of five European countries declared their concern over the situation.[56]

According to a spokesperson for the National Security Council, the topic of anti-gay persecution did not arise at a May 10 meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Lavrov. A White House spokesperson said she was “not 100 percent sure” whether Trump had been briefed on the issue. As of May 10, neither Trump nor U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had made any public comment on the matter. [57]

A spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Israel blamed reports of anti-gay persecution in Chechnya on a “propaganda campaign against Russia”. In a May 11 letter published in the newspaper Haaretz, press attaché Dmitry Alushkin asserted that “authorized official government bodies of the Russian Federation” had conducted an investigation and that “[there] are no victims of persecution, threats or violence”. He criticized Israeli citizens for spreading “factually incorrect information”.[58][59]

Many celebrities and LGBT activists such as Troye Sivan, Ellen DeGeneres, Matt Bomer, Mark Ruffalo, and Billy Eichner have voiced their strong condemnation against these camps.[60][61]|||
