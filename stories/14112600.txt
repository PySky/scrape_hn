I am with the other answers written that the value of the functioning of an app is more important as compared to its UI, and as each and every software today is highly customizable and configurable, it is best to do UI testing manually. But still, as the question says UI–centric business application, I am assuming that the user interface forms the crux of the application and the UX/UI is very intensive. Keeping up to that, I thinkcan definitely help you out with that, especially if you are looking to build ‘real’ automation test meaning code based testing. And I think its worth the effort to chose selenium as it is supported across many languages and fits for regression testing as well.To get better insights on test automation and its evolvements, I have come across a webinar on. Looks a promising one and its free as well.|||
