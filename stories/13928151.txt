Indian police might have helped the secretive Scotland Yard hack into the e-mails of hundreds of political campaigners and journalists, according to a new report.

Allegations made by an anonymous individual claim that the police unit in London worked with the Indian police to get illegal access to the e-mail accounts of campaigners, reporters and press photographers, the Guardian reported.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission in the UK is investigating the claim. The e-mails, at least four of which belonged to Greenpeace activists, were regularly checked by the Scotland Yard for information.

The letter said: “For a number of years the unit had been illegally accessing the email accounts of activists. This has largely been accomplished because of the contact that one of the officers had developed with counterparts in India who in turn were using hackers to obtain email passwords.”

There aren’t many details as to how the Indian police was involved but initial reports say that Indian police used hackers to obtain e-mails for contacts developed by one of the officers in Scotland Yard.|||
