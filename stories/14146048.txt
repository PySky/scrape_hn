One of the biggest dramas surrounding the launch of the iPhone 7 was the fact that it did not include the jack connector and consequently that it was incompatible with the headsets of most users.

Apple offered a decent solution to this: to offer a jack adapter to Lightning for use by iPhone 7 owners.

However, we have always been doubtful if this adapter would be present also in future iPhone. For although Apple has given the change to Lightning and wireless connections, many users still have headphones with jack connection.

Now, as rumors indicate, Apple will continue to include the adapter in the next iPhone case. At least one more year.

While it is true that the change has been gross for many users, Apple already offers compatible headsets with their phones (when many manufacturers do not even offer headphones) Why should Apple also include an adapter?

After almost a year with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, many users have not even released the adapter.

Either because they are enough EarPods, or because they use a wireless headset like the AirPods. We will see if in 2018 we also have an adapter in the iPhone case.|||
