Along with a couple other members of the Scout team, I'm heading to sunny Phoenix, Arizona in mid-April for RailsConf. I'm a performance addict, so I've been scanning through the sessions and making notes of the ones that stand out.

My performance short-list is below.

Daniel will explore how to instrument, debug, and profile your app, using the capabilities of the Rails framework and the Ruby VM. He'll also show how to do this on a live, production system.

It's no secret that Ruby's straight-line and concurrency performance is, well, less-than stellar. However, that doesn't mean you need to throw your beatiful Ruby code away as your app grows. In this session, I'm interested in hearing Christian's take on Elixir and any war stories of how folks leverage Phoenix for high-concurrency needs alongside an existing Rails app.

Finding a one-line config change that deliver a more reliable, faster app experience is like finding a $50 bill on the sidewalk. I'm curious to see Nate's take on this.

Why's your app slow? The database, the database, the database. Usually. I'm interested in hearing Will's take on scaling Postgres from small to large scale.

I've long been an admirer of the Skylight agent and its usage of Rust for high-performance work. Helix is an open-source toolkit for writing native Ruby extensions in Rust.|||
