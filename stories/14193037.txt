One of Three Companies in the World that puts Privacy First

We’re one of only three privacy software companies in the world with a demonstrated record of placing our users’ privacy ahead of business & financial interests. When Google issued us an ultimatum to allow them to track you or cut off our revenues, we refused any tracking even though our revenues were cut off.

You trust us to protect them, and we trust you to ensure we survive. Thank you to the thousands who've donated to us.

We have always made plain what our product does and doesn’t do, unlike the vast majority of so-called privacy companies which prevaricate, mislead, and hide their failings.|||
