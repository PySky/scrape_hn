The SQL query is this (I omitted irrelevant details):

The sql query in direct database or through Hibernate (3.5) SQL runs 1000 faster than using Criteria or HQL to express this.

The SQL generated is identical from HQL and Criteria and the SQL I posted there.

[EDIT]: Correction - the sql was not identical. I didn't try the Hibernate style parameter setting on the management studio side because I did not realize this until later - see my answer.

If I separate out the subqueries into separate queries, then it is fast again.

I looked at Hibernate code and it is doing something astounding. It has a loop through all 300 results that end up hitting the database.

it hits the database with the full SQL, but there are no results collected anywhere.

Then it proceeds to go through this loop

Where for every one of the expected 300 results, it ends up hitting the database to get the actual result.

This seems insane, since it should already have all the results after 1 query. Hibernate logs do not show any additional SQL being issued during all that time.

Anyone have any insight? The only option I have is to go to native SQL query through Hibernate.|||
