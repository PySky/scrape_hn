== Version 2.0 ==



UKClimbing logbooks are here! We've added an online search for UKClimbing.com - you can now search all 370,000 routes on UKC and access your entire logbook. Previously, only installed Rockfax routes would appear in your logbook, even after you logged in to your UKC account. Now any routes you've not installed from a Rockfax bundle will appear in you logbook as a UKC route.

Improvements

------------

~ Massively improved rendering performance of the overlay on topos and particularly on large offline maps (like the Chamonix map).

~ Rockfax routes can now be searched by their country name.

~ Country names have better granularity for the UK, so England, Wales, Scotland instead of just United Kingdom.



Bug Fixes

---------

~ Fixed a crash when trying to show a route on its topo (only occurred if it was ticked).

~ Fixed a crash that could occur installing packages on iOS 10.

~ Fixed a crash that could occur when searching in the Routes tab.
