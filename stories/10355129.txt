A couple of weeks back Destructoid's very own Ben Davis reviewed Undertale, a very EarthBound-inspired JRPG that melded a unique battle system, non-combat progression options, and a charming narrative to create an incredibly memorable experience. The game not only got a perfect score on Destructoid, but also our Editor's Choice award.

You can read Ben's review here. It's a very good video game indeed.

Apparently, we here at Destructoid were not the only people to really love Undertale, as right now it is the highest rated PC game on Metacritic, beating out Half-Life 2, GTA V, The Orange Box, Half-Life and BioShock by a single point.

While Metacritic's methods of aggregation are flawed at best, it's still reassuring to see a quirky, minimalist JRPG see such widespread critical reception.

So, have you tried Undertale yet? I'm currently on my second playthrough and it's filling the EarthBound-shaped hole in my gaming soul quite nicely.|||
