Sad your love for Radiohead, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga went unreciprocated in the form of tickets to this year's sold-out Coachella Festival? Fret not, now you and your posse can don floppy hats, sundresses and/or Ray Bans with neck straps from the comfort of your own man-or-woman cave where you and yours can watch the proceedings live and direct. This because YouTube for this seventh year in a row will livestream Coachella's first weekend (April 14-16) and will include sets by the bill's headlining triumvirate among many others.

YouTube also name-checked a number of sets by others artists on the underbill which would be aired, including sets by Lorde, Bon Iver, The xx, Future, ScHoolboy Q, Two Door Cinema Club, New Order, and Gucci Mane.

Also offered is the ability create a personalized viewing schedule which will prompt livestream channels to automatically change to your artist faves.

The livestream is presented with sponsor T-Mobile and will allow fans to access Coachella's YouTube channel via desktop, mobile and living room.
