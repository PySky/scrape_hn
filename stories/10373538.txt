MathsJam is a monthly opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like. Puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting.

We meet on the second to last Tuesday of every month, from 7pm in the evening, in locations around the world.

For more details of local events, choose your region from the menu, or visit the find a jam page.

If there isn't an event in your area, and you'd like there to be one, please email katie@mathsjam.com for details of how you can set one up!

MathsJam is not for children. MathsJam is an event for adults to meet and socialise, which is why they are mainly held in licensed premises, where under-18s are not allowed. Do let us know via katie@mathsjam.com if you come across an event for children being called "MathsJam", or you see MathsJam being promoted to young students.

MathsJam also runs an annual gathering which takes place every November. More information about the gatherings can be found on the gathering pages.|||
