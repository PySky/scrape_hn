It’s good to classify your fears. Sometimes it’s enough to ask a few questions that will help you verify whether there’s really anything to be afraid of. Here are some possible issues that might come up (and our ways of dealing with them).

“I fear that I’ll lose control over my remote software team”

You need to check the following:

Videoconferences, e-mails and chats aren’t everything. Always pay attention to those issues:

“I fear that I’ll have difficulties in controlling the budget”

The matter of budgetary control is still the focus of many debates. Usually, two voices can be heard – those of Fixed Price fans and Time&Material supporters. Market experience allows for betting on the latter approach, which allows for more possibilities – but these are worth exploring further…

“I fear that I will lose control over the form of the project”

Involving the customer in planning the consecutive stages of the tasks and progress presentations is one thing, but their actual influence on functional changes is another. It’s worth to get to know your future partner and make sure you’ve got these things down:

“I fear that the team won’t handle the product’s future development”

Your product will – in time – require expansion or technological changes. You should do an early check to see if the partner has experience in dealing with long-term co-operation.

And one more thing.

You can’t forget that you and your hired crew are playing for the same team. You’ll all want to grow and face new challenges. This should make you sleep easier already!

I’m waiting for your questions, including your lists of fears that I could, perhaps, try to deal with in the future.|||
