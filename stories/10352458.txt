Joe De Sena is the co-founder of Spartan Race, a military-inspired obstacle race series. At 13 he started a pool cleaning and construction company in Queens, NY. After selling that company he went to work in finance, spending his free time training and competing in adventure races. In 2007 Joe moved to Pittsfield, Vermont and created Spartan with Andy Weinberg. Craig met up with Joe in Pittsfield during the trial run of Spartan's Agoge, a 60 hour endurance challenge that included a segment where participants were chased up a mountain by dogs. In addition to explaining his rationale behind the Agoge, Joe talks about how he's grown Spartan to reach over 20 countries and 1M participants in 2015.
