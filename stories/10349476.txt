A repository that tries to feel superior by correcting your mistakes. I'm sometimes culturally insensitive and rude. Sorry.

The heart of this project is a user of the same name on github, orthographic-pedant. This user scans popular repositories for common typos and will attempt to correct them with proper pull requests.
