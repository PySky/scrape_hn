About 5 months each day during 3-5 hours I was collecting from all over the internet (from books, blogs, articles, videos, podcasts, news, and comments) best growth hacks, which inspired me to test them for my startup.



First growth hacks I was compressing into a short form and keeping in a private document. And then the crazy idea hit my head —  establish an e-mail subscription service, that sends every day one short growth hack. This is how growthhackingidea.com was born. After 3 weeks there were 1700 subscribers ($0 marketing cost).



I was reading, choosing tasty growth hacks, I eager to test and implement. After 3 months there were 17 000 subscribers ($0 marketing cost). People from companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, TechStars, Hubspot, Coca-Cola, Indiegogo, Disney, 500 startups, LinkedIn, Adobe became our subscribers.
