This is a demo of Visual Dialog, accompanying the CVPR 2017 paper, hosted on CloudCV.

Visual Dialog is a novel task that requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Given an image, dialog history, and a follow-up question about the image, the agent has to answer the question.

Code for this demo is available at github.com/cloud-cv/visual-chatbot and Torch code for training and evaluating Visual Dialog models is available at github.com/batra-mlp-lab/visdial.
