Back in September we added open source licenses to repository overview pages. Now, when you view a repository's license, we'll tell you a bit more about it.

If a project is licensed under a popular open source license like MIT, Apache, or GPL, you'll see a brief description of the license, along with an overview of what you can and can't do with the project.

Interested in incorporating the license metadata in your own project? The license descriptions and metadata are themselves open source, pulled from choosealicense.com and made available via the license API.

We hope the additional license metadata helps you make informed choices, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers (at least most of us aren't). If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it, of course, it’s always best to consult with a professional.|||
