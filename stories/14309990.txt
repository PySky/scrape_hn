NoEstimates is a movement in software delivery popularized by Woody Zuill, Vasco Duarte and Neil Killick (among others) that encourages people to use different, quicker and often more reliable methods of forecasting work than up-front estimating. It is premised on the idea and research suggesting that estimating is difficult, has low correlation with actual delivery times and sometimes creates a false sense of security. Instead, time is better spent getting to work on small pieces of a project, using data to forecast and then reducing sources of variation, such as work in progress.

Asynchronites Matt Philip and Angie Haakenson have created a board game designed to teach the concepts and practice of NoEstimates. You can play the game at one of the upcoming conferences where Matt will appear this fall. If youâ€™re unable to attend one of his workshops, you can download the materials and play the game yourself.
