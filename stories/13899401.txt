Guetzling is a simple script for macOS and Linux written in Bash to automate (recursively finding files) the compression of JPGs and PNGs using the Guetzli algorithm.

By design, Guetzling will overwrite and/or delete your original files. If you want to keep your originals, make a backup of your folder before using Guetzling.

Or follow the Linux install to do it manualy.

By Default, Guetzling uses the following options:

You can adjust these options using flags:

Quality for JPG or PNG re-compression. - Requires a value between 84 and 100. - Default value is the same as Guetzli: 95.

Compress PNGs ONLY - Use this flag and Guetzling will ignore JPGs files, compressing only PNGs.
