Product Naming Update

 Seldon’s current open-source platform has been renamed Seldon Core to allow us to distinguish our open-source machine learning deployment platform from a new product that we are currently working on. We will share more info with you soon and will reach out to this group for beta testers.

Thanks to @colemickens for submitting both of the above issues!|||
