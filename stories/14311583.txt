In response to market trends and student feedback, Stanford's Computer Science department launched redesigned versions of their introductory courses this quarter, swapping out Java in favor of JavaScript, marking the first major change to their introductory CS curriculum since 2002.

I have talked about all the reasons you should learn Javascript but this marks a major shift in traditional computer science education adopting one of the most widely used programming languages in the world into their curriculum. I can firmly stand by my statement back in October, Javascript is Eating the world!|||
