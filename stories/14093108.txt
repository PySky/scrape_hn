A robot bar is headed to the Strip’s Miracle Mile Shops this summer and right next door at Harmon Corner, a new microbrew concept will also eliminate any interaction with a human bartender.

Planned for the retail hub’s bridge level, the corner's owners hope to install a 12-foot in diameter kiosk that will let pedestrians walk up, scan their ID, pass a facial recognition test and then fill a 16-ounce cup from one of 26 kegs of microbrews and more familiar commercial brands.

The ID check can also automatically prevent customers from breaking Nevada state law and block them from pouring more than 48 ounces for themselves within a 15-minute time span. The machines take 20 to 50 seconds per pour.

Overseen by up to five human helpers, the Strip is no stranger to pour-your-own gimmicks, including TAG Sports Bar at The Linq, but this appears to be the first "grab and go" concept not aligned with a tavern or restaurant. One floor below the kiosk, Harmon Corner already hosts local microbrewers Sin City Brewing as a ground floor tenant.

No timetable for an arrival has been announced and the project will need Clark County approval.|||
