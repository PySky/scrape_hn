How does Google manage its own devices? With a huge range of devices on multiple platforms used by over 61,000 employees, it’s no small feat.

Google’s Technical Infrastructure organization is tasked with protecting employees against sophisticated adversaries, while ensuring that corporate security practices do not interfere with Google’s culture of innovation, freedom and flexibility. It accomplishes this with a tiered access security model that categorizes corporate services and devices into trust tiers to determine access.

Today, we are sharing details about our tiered access approach so that IT admins can use it to deploy devices in their organizations.

In contrast to traditional security models, tiered access looks at a wide range of variables to make granular decisions regarding access. These variables go beyond simple user authentications—for example, device state, group permissions and required level of trust for a particular employee role are all taken into account.

First, internal services are associated with a trust tier according to the sensitivity of the data. A service can have one minimum trust tier or a more granular model of access where components and/or capabilities (e.g. read or write access) have different minimum trust tiers based on risk.|||
