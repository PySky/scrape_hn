This is a follow-up to my previous post about a bug in GCC. I was reading comments, and observed that some readers say that the example I used is rare, or artificial, or that it does not follow “good programming practices”. I want to give you another example.

I will be using a of s:

I do not consider it a good idea in general, but I know people often do it: sometimes because this is simply the right thing to do, and sometimes because this gives them the feeling that they are relieved of any memory management issues.

Also, I will be using to avoid subtle memory leaks, as described in Herb Sutter’s GotW #89. Let’s construct a vector storing two pointers:

Now, what is ? Something that is a resource-managing class, or at least looks like one, but also something that helps us test exception safety:

Function is implemented so that it succeeds upon the first call, and fails upon the second call: this emulates resource exhaustion:

And this is enough to re-create our bug in GCC! Here is the full example:

Here again, there is a temporary involved, although we cannot see it explicitly: a temporary of type . Similarly, the destructor of a is skipped…|||
