Quill is a registration system designed especially for hackathons. For hackers, it‚Äôs a clean and streamlined interface to submit registration and confirmation information. For hackathon organizers, it‚Äôs an easy way to manage applications, view registration stats, and more!

After users login, the Dashboard displays the user‚Äôs application status and status-specific prompts to resend a verification email, view/edit their application or confirmation forms.

The Application tab takes users to their registration or confirmation form.

Hackathons commonly allow participants to register and be admitted as a team. The Team tab allows users to create or join a team with other users.

Admins can view stats, look through applications, or edit settings from the Admin panel.

The Stats tab summarizes useful registration statistics on the number of users in each stage of the process, demographic information, and miscellaneous event preferences like shirt sizes, dietary restrictions, or reimbursement requests.

The Users tab displays a table of users where admins can:

On the Settings tab, admins can easily control their event application timeline by setting registration / confirmation deadlines. They can also write custom waitlist, acceptance, and confirmation copy that users will see on their dashboard throughout the application process. The custom copy is interpreted as Markdown, so HTML and images can be added.
