Clone this repo to your local machine, and add the RNN-Tutorial directory as a system variable to your . Instructions given for bash shell:

Create a Conda environment (You will need to Install Conda first)

If you have a NVIDIA GPU with CUDA already installed

If you will be running TensorFlow on CPU only (e.g. a MacBook Pro), use the following command (if you get an error the first time you run this command read below):

Error note (if you did not get an error skip this paragraph): Depending on how you installed pip and/or conda, we've seen different outcomes. If you get an error the first time, rerunning it may incorrectly show that it installs without error. Try running with . The flag tells it to reinstall the package. If that still doesn't work, please open an issue, or you can try to follow the advice here.

We have included example unittests for the script

All configurations for the RNN training script can be found in

NOTE: If you have a GPU available, the code will run faster if you set in

To visualize your results via tensorboard:

We have included example data from the LibriVox corpus in . The data is separated into folders:

If you would like to train a performant model, you can add additional wave and txt files to these folders, or create a new folder and update with the folder locations

We made a few additions to your -- remove those additions if you want, or if you want to keep the system variables, add it to your by running:
