Previous month I wrote how we reduced converge time to 1h for the whole infrastructure. Today I can say, it’s way too much to wait for changes. We wanted to see changes faster than waiting an hour or sometimes unpredictable amount of time.

Day by day run list is getting fatter, thus the challenge was to keep this task as simple as possible and do not introduce any complex layer underneath. We made a resolution (raising eyebrow) to involve simple versioning mechanism for roles.

The idea is very simple:

This improved build just deploys roles their versions were increased. To have fully consistent state between all nodes we trigger another Jenkins’s build like to reflect all changes across all nodes equally. But with this incremental deployment, we can see changes rapidly.

Here is an example how to manipulate dynamic playbook file:

Everything is trivial, take file as a source, strip part from this and generate the new one with appropriate .|||
