How I broke down the process into three phases.

There are a lot of ways to slice this cake, but I am just going to share a little bit about how I decided to go about the process of setting up a website.

Everyone will have variables depending on where they are at, where they want to go, and what their goals are. For this reason, I will give you a quick backstory and then explain my 3 phases.

I am the co-founder of UNUM messenger, which you can learn more about here. Anyways, we are about four months into development with plans to launch our closed beta in approximately 40 days.

Based on the feedback we receive, we are going to plan out our course of action, and set a date for a hard launch.

Now that you have a little bit of a backstory, here are the 3 phases I am still currently going through to develop a website.

As soon as I had my idea, I wanted to get something online to start getting the word out. The easiest way to do this was to set up a splash page (landing page.)

The concept was still unproven at this point, so I wanted the page to be as simple as possible. To do this, I went to Launchrock.

I knew I could get away with a super minimalistic design to get started, so I spent a few hours mocking up the page.

All I did was buy a domain (you can use a Launchrock domain for free,) chose a template, created a basic image concept, added some copy, and added a signup form. (I added the press kit in later on.)

This was the end result —|||
