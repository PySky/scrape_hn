DJ software specialist Serato has announced Serato Sample, a sampling plug-in that aims to bring the speed and ease of typical DJ workflows to fully-fledged DAW environments where sound quality is of paramout importance. Best of all, you can sign up for a public Beta and try it out for yourself.

Designed to quickly find, chop, key shift and time stretch samples, Serato Sample leans heavily on the company's battle-hardened and continuously-refined Pitch 'n' Time audio manipulation plug-in tech.

Serato CEO, Young Ly, says, “Over the years we’ve seen huge growth in the crossover between DJing and producing so it feels like a natural next step for us to return to the world of production. And in turn it made sense to leverage our successful plugin, Pitch ‘n Time.

"We’re very excited about Serato Sample and the feedback from our private beta has been extremely positive. The next phase is public beta to ensure a top quality product is released. Check out serato.com/sample if you're interested in finding out more."
