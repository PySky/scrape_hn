The Aasta Hansteen discovery was made in 1997. Together with Haklang and Snefrid Sør, the recoverable resources are estimated at 47 billion standard cubic metres (Sm3) of gas.

Recovering the resources on Aasta Hansteen will be demanding as the discovery is located far from land and outside the established infrastructure. The water depth is significant and the weather conditions are challenging.

The PDO (Plan for development and operations) was submitted to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy at the end of December 2012.

The Aasta Hansteen field will be run from Harstad, by Statoil’s Operations North organisation. The supply base will be located in Sandnessjøen and the helicopter base in Brønnøysund.

 

 The planned field development includes a SPAR platform, which will be the first such installation on the Norwegian continental shelf. SPAR is a floating installation consisting of a vertical column moored to the seabed. The installation features conventional topsides with processing facilities. The risers transporting the gas from the seabed to the platform and onward to Polarled will be pure steel, the first of its kind on the Norwegian continental shelf. The hull will be equipped with storage for condensate which will be loaded onto shuttle tankers at the field.

Polarled is a new 480-kilometre gas pipeline from Aasta Hansteen to Nyhamna in Møre og Romsdal county that was completed in September 2015. The pipeline will facilitate the development of Aasta Hansteen and other fields in the Norwegian Sea.

 

 The project includes expansion of the Shell-operated gas plant at Nyhamna. Preparations will be made for the tie-in of existing and future discoveries in the area.|||
