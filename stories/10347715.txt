A nurse who administered flu vaccines to employees of a West Windsor company has been reported to health officials because she re-used a single syringe for the shots.

At an employer-sponsored flu clinic at Otsuka Pharmaceuticals last week, the unnamed nurse committed an "infection control breach," according to a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health.

"Full infection control practices that prevent transmission of blood-borne diseases were not used by a contracted health care agency, Total Wellness," said Donna Leusner, the spokeswoman.

Most of the employees impacted by the clinic breach have been notified. Although the state says the risk of infection is low, state and local health officials, along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are recommending those employees be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the HIV virus.

The name of the nurse has been referred to the state Board of Nursing, which regulates nursing, according to Leusner.

While the nurse used a new needle for each employee, she reportedly continued to use the same syringe for 67 employees, according to NBC10, the Philadelphia television station.

The nurse was contracted by the agency to staff the clinic. The company has issued a statement on the episode that says, "TotalWellness, the employer group, and the New Jersey Department of Health are proactively working together to inform all participants and provide them the necessary resources and a plan to mitigate any potential medical concerns and exposure risks."

"TotalWellness is dedicated to ensuring all participants receive any and all appropriate screenings, care and counseling until this matter is resolved."
