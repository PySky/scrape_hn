Hey. I found your software is online. Can you write the code for my proje=

 ct? Terms of reference attached below.

 The price shall discuss, if you can make. Answer please.

The "PROJECT.gz" file, despite its extension, was actually a RAR archive containing a "PROJECT.doc" MS Word document, presumably with some malicious macro payload (I didn't bother to check).

The earlier one had a "2701.zip" attachment, with a "2701.doc" inside, likely the same as the other one (unfortunately I had not kept it for reference).

Both messages appearing to be hand-crafted, and the reference to today's date in the attachment file name IMHO hint at a focused campaign explicitly targeting targets perceived as "high return investments", such as developers (possibly working on popular / open source projects).

I doubt many of us would fall for this stuff, but I felt a heads up was in order nonetheless ;)

As soon as I published this post I checked my inbox and there was another one...

It looked like a VBA marcro malware, indeed. Thanks Ludovic for reminding me of Virustotal.
