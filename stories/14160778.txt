The team at Refdash is doing a stellar job and re-writing the playbook of technical hiring! I had the chance to gain insights into the technical hiring process as well as get introduced to great companies. The interview feedback given by Refdash, gave me very clear ideas of what I needed to work on, and what was working. Following the mock interview phase, the guys at Refdash have a consistent follow-up, guiding you into thinking strategically about your career, and how to align your personal ambitions with the opportunities ahead of you.|||
