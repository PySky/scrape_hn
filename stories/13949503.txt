Apple will begin to manufacture iPhones in India in the next two months, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal. The manufacturing duties will fall to Wistron Corp which will reportedly start manufacturing iPhone 6 and 6S models in the next four to six weeks, and iPhone SE devices in around three months.
