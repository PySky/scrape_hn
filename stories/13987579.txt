The ML630Q464/466 MCUs integrate functions required for data logging such as USB, clock generation, RC oscillation type AD converter, data display, and PDF file generation on a single chip.

Data loggers are typically attached to packages and in many cases disposable. In addition, operating guidelines such as FDA regulations on cold chain and GDP require reliable recording of package conditions during transport and the output of uneditable PDF files to prevent tampering of records (log data).

The Lapis chip provides PDF file generation and integrate key functions for USB data logging on-chip.

The MCUs are based on an ARM Cortex M0+ CPU core which converts log data to PDF in about 4 seconds and operation is enabled for up to 380 days using a single coin battery.

The ADC provides a temperature measurement accuracy of ±0.5℃ using only a thermistor and resistor/capacitor, unlike typical temperature measurement circuits consisting of a temperature sensor, thermistor, and reference voltage generation circuit.

For low power consumption the standby current consumption is 0.8uA by supporting 4 low power modes.|||
