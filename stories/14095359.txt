I have a very close-knit family, I'm 19, and my youngest brother is 11. My parents are very understanding, my mother is my best friend, my father is always there when you need him, they don’t even argue, maximum 10 minutes and still their arguments raise a smile. Twice a year, my parents go on vacation, once with us, and the second time by themselves. But recently I found out that my parents are not even married and, moreover, they don’t plan onto! So the situation was cleared when mom and dad wanted to adopt a child, and there were problems with documentation. I asked my mother why it happened, and whether it hurts her ... It turns out no. Mom told me that at first her and Dad did not like each other, but simply lived together, because there was simply nowhere to live, and then there was me and dad was not even the man of whom she had dreamed. I went to dad in prostration, and dad said, "who would marry her, do I look like a fool??". The next day they flew to Cuba. I’m completely lost, like what the hell is this???|||
