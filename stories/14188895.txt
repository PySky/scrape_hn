Many believe that great packaging increases sales. I agree. The unfortunate truth is that no one in our space is doing a really good job (for us to uh, use as inspiration) and we aren’t in a position to test our way to a market-leading solution.

Oh, and another thing: since we’re planning to sell online, our first impression won’t be rendered based on packaging. It will be far more important to focus on the website design, product photography, and copy, so instead we’ll focus on keeping per-unit costs low and utility.

The solution was immediately clear: a flat, low-density polyethylene bag. Think Ziploc bag but with a thicker plastic and a white backing on one side.

These poly bags are cheap ($0.10 per unit vs. $0.40+ for corrugated paper), take up less physical space than other packaging does (which will lead to a cost-savings on warehouse costs), and is easy to open.

The big realization: it’s what’s inside that counts. We’re here to make the best cable, not the best cable packaging.|||

“Why?” is the most important question to ask. Why do our competitors use a corrugated paper box? Why bright secondary colors? Why do they repeat themselves so much? Time to challenge some assumptions.
