Just have them click your link and you'll instantly see their browser details - it's better than standing over their shoulder!

It's not actually magic - the way this works is that when you visit this page, a unique ID is generated. After this page loads, it makes WebSocket connection to the user-agent.io server. That connection stays open until you close the page, and the server marks it as associated with your unique ID.

Then, when a user clicks on your link, the server matches the ID in the link to your WebSocket connection. It reads the visitor's User-Agent header and sends it to your browser over the WebSocket.|||
