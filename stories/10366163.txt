I just read the article generating Quines in Ruby and I really enjoyed it. I wanted to do a quine myself in R.

So, what's a quine? A quine is a self reproducing software. It must meet two conditions:

Here is my solution in R. It displays its source code on standard output when executed. It is mostly inspired by the C code from the original article:

As noted in the original article, it's a good practice to test one's own solution with . If the output of your quine and its source are identical, will not produce any output, else, happy debugging ;)

My solution is much longer than the one on rosetta code for example. But who care's? It was funny to do and it was a good little puzzle to solve. And I even learn a new function of R ( ).

So it's up to you now. Let me know if you write a quine, whatever the language ;)|||
