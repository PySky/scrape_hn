The NAB 2017 is the annual National Association of Broadcasters conference where thousands of audiovisual content experts come together. Apple, owning one of the most powerful professional video editing tools on the market, also participates.

During a conference held today, Apple announced the company’s new achievement: 2 million users of Final Cut Pro X. Version 10 of Final Cut came to light five years ago, nor did they themselves expect this host.

In addition, as they say, has cost much less the second million users than the first, so we are facing an exponential growth.

Remember that Final Cut By X changed the rules of the game. It was an application written entirely from scratch, without regard to the above. As before any change, the users reacted with a previous rejection.

So much so that even signatures were collected to re-publish the previous versions of Final Cut.

However, little by little the professionals began to accept the new version that despite changing the interface to simplify it and eliminate the complete functionalities, yes it is true that it maintains powerful tools although not in sight of all.

Final Cut Pro X has a simpler interface but thanks to the multitude of plugins you can receive, it is a powerful professional editing tool. Its price is 299 euros in the Mac App Store with a 30-day trial version.

With the promise of new Mac professionals for these months and the hiring of virtual reality experts and videos in 360 degrees … Final Cut is waiting for an exciting future.|||
