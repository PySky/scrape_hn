On March 7th, 2017, a repeal for the "Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Communication Services" bill that protects the people from having their information sold from ISPs to paying bidders. On March 23rd, 2017, a joint resolution was made and the bill was repealed by our senators who had received generous donations from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as AT&T and Comcast.

We the people, by signing this petition, demand that Congress reinstates this bill to protect the American people from having their information released by our ISPs.|||
