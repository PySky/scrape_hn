In sliding window technique, we maintain a window that satisfies the problem constraints. The window is unstable if it violates the problem constraints and it tries stabilize by increasing or decreasing itâ€™s size.



 Below are some of commonly asked interview questions that uses sliding window technique â€“

Given a string and a positive number k, find the longest substring of given string containing k distinct characters. If k is more than number of distinct characters in the string, return the whole string.



Find all substrings of a string that contains all characters of another string. In other words, find all substrings of first string that are anagrams of second string.



Given a string, find the longest substring of given string containing distinct characters.



Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get maximum length sequence of continuous ones.



Given an Boolean array, find the maximum sequence of continuous 1â€™s that can be formed by replacing at-most k zeroes by ones.



Given an array of integers, find minimum sum sub-array of given size k.



Given an array of integers, find a sub-array having given sum in it.



Given an array of integers, find the length of smallest subarray whose sum of elements is greater than the given positive number.
