Now, this is a piece of news for Snapchat users in India. Snapchat CEO, Evan Spiegel, feels that you are too poor to use his "rich people's app".

According to a report by Variety, Spiegel allegedly made the comment during a meeting to discuss the growth of the app’s user base in 2015.

When an employee raised concern about the app’s slow growth in a market like India, which has a growing mobile penetration, Spiegel cut the employee mid-sentence reportedly saying, “This app is only for rich people."

Variety quoted the employee’s revelation about Spiegel's reply: “I don’t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.”

According to unverified reports, Snapchat had close to 4 million users in India last year. While though the exact user base is not available, this number is expected to have grown since then.

Following the controversy and massive outrage online Snapchat said employe who made the claim, Anthony Pompliano was "fired for poor performance," three weeks ago and has been involved in in a lawsuit with the company.

"This is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It's available worldwide to download for free," an international spokesperson of Snap said in a statement.

"Those words were written by a disgruntled former employee. We are grateful for our Snapchat community in India and around the world," the statement added.|||
