This library supports the collection and publication of GenServer and GenStage runtime metrics. Metrics data are generated by an introspection agent. No instrumentation is required within the GenServer or GenStage library or within your application source code.

By default, metrics are published by a dedicated GenMetrics reporting process. Any application can subscribe to this process in order to handle metrics data at runtime. Metrics data can also be pushed directly to a agent which makes it possible to analyze, and visualize the metrics within existing tools and services like and .

Given an application with the following GenServers: , , activate metrics collection for the server cluster as follows:

Metrics are published by a dedicated GenMetrics reporting process. Any application can subscribe to this process in order to receive metrics data. Sample summary metrics data for a GenServer process looks as follows:

Detailed statistical metrics data per process are also available. See the documentation for details.

Given a GenStage application with the following stages: , , and a , activate metrics collection for the entire pipeline as follows:

Metrics are published by a dedicated GenMetrics reporting process. Any application can subscribe to this process in order to receive metrics data. Sample summary metrics data for a GenStage process looks as follows:

Detailed statistical metrics data per process are also available. See the documentation for details.

Redirect your GenServer cluster metrics data to the Datadog service as follows:

Redirect your GenStage pipeline metrics data to a agent as follows:

Find detailed documentation for the GenMetrics library on HexDocs.

GenStage requires Elixir v1.4. Just add to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:
