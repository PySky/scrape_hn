RUDOLF WINTER CAME TO WESTON PARK AGAIN THIS YEAR ALL THE WAY FROM GERMANY WITH HIS INCREDIBLE F-14 TOMCAT,

RUDOLF SENT THIS INFO OVER ON THE MODEL -

My F14 is an early Fly Eagly Jet ARF Kit. It is the standard (non honey comb) one. I heavily modified it and reinforced a lot of areas. For example on the first load test prior to the mods the swing wing pivot broke out of the wing... I had to open both wings and put new spars in them... engines are Frank Raptor with 20kg thrust each. Take of weight including fuel is 37kg

KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR THE WINGS AS THEY SWEEP BACK IN FLIGHT FOR SUPER SONIC FLIGHT AND FORWARD AGAIN FOR SLOW FLYING AND LANDING,

ALSO A NICE TOUCH ARE THE AFTER BURNER RINGS LIGHTING UP ON TAKE OFF AND VERTICAL FLIGHT, (THESE ARE EXTREMELY BRIGHT LEDS FORMING A CIRCLE AROUND THE EXHAST DUCTS)

ANOTHER FEATURE DURING THE DISPLAY ARE THE BRIGHT FLARES LAUNCHED FROM THE MODEL TO DISTRACT GROUND TO AIR MISSILES AS ON THE REAL AIRCRAFT,

FILMED AT WESTON PARK RC MODEL AIRCRAFT SHOW - WESTON PARK - WESTON UNDER LIZARD - NEAR SHIFNAL - SHROPSHIRE - TF11 5LE - 3 MILES OFF M54 / JUNCTION 3 - 8 MILES OFF M6 / JUNCTION 12, OVER THE WEEKEND OF JUNE 15th & 16th 2013,
