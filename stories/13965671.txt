Kubernetes LEMP Stack is a distributed LEMP stack built on top of a Kubernetes cluster. It enables anyone to deploy multiple CMSs (currently WordPress) for any number of websites. We built it to be secure and very fast by default.

Currently this supports Google Compute Engine as a cloud provider. Other providers haven't been tested (things like and depend on your cloud provider).

There are already stable turn-key deployments for various CMSs via Kubernetes Helm Charts, but Kubernetes LEMP Stack is designed more or less in the traditional LEMP fashion where you get a bucket for all of your HTML at and you may or may not use a CMS.

Actually, k8s LEMP Stack should be able to serve as your own personal web server farm! Use it as a backend to your own cloud hosting company! We also want extra customisation in terms of our web server and security hardening measures. In addition, future improvements aim to make this software scalable and highly-available.

This project was inspired by the official Kubernetes WordPress + MySQL sample and builds on it with the various other official Docker images and Kubernetes applications mentioned previously.|||
