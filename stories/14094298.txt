Welcome to the mesopedic WikiProject JavaScript. If you would like to use, learn, or write JavaScript for the betterment of Wikipedia (and beyond), including the improvement of coverage of JavaScript-related topics and support pages, you've come to the right place.

This is a central resource depot and organization hub for everything having to do with JavaScript on Wikipedia, including user scripts. This WikiProject provides a place for editors to share knowledge and ideas (on the talk page) about JavaScript, improve their JavaScript programming skills, and collaborate (get help) in developing user scripts. If you would like to get involved, please add yourself as a participant in this project, below.

To get a bird's eye view of what Wikipedia has about JavaScript, see Draft:Outline of JavaScript and Index of JavaScript-related articles. If you are likewise interested in scripts, see User:The Transhumanist/Outline of scripts.

This WikiProject is mesopedic, meaning that it operates on articles in the encyclopedia and on pages in project space. Basically, articles related to JavaScript, and everything in the Wikipedia community about using and creating user scripts on Wikipedia.

All articles about JavaScript. They are listed on the following pages:

Anything and everything about user scripts, including but not limited to:

This project has three main goals:

Toward this end, this WikiProject identifies, gathers, and rates all articles about JavaScript. It also identifies, gathers, and creates redirects to all article sections about JavaScript (for example, the link Comment (JavaScript) redirects to Comment (computer programming)#JavaScript). In addition, we identify gaps in JavaScript coverage, and plan coverage for missing topics by maintaining a list of needed articles and article sections.

To "gather" an article about JavaScript, add it to the Index of JavaScript-related articles.

This goal entails identifying and listing all user scripts and pages about user scripts, as well as developing support pages for writing and maintaining user scripts.

Do you know JavaScript? No? Doesn't matter. Because with all the resources (knowledge and JavaScript programs) that we have at Wikipedia, we can learn it and improve our skills together.

If you are writing scripts and are stuck, post a message explaining your problem on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject JavaScript (this project's talk page). In addition to posting a discussion thread there, you may also wish to post a link (to your discussion thread), on the following pages:

If you don't know how to program in JavaScript but need a user script (or gadget) to do a particular thing, you can post your ideas and requests at the following page:

In the editor, precede your JavaScript code with this:

and follow it with this:

and it will turn out looking something like this:

We are building a list of web resources on JavaScript at WP:JSRL, to help editors find useful links to add to articles, and to provide reliable sources on JavaScript. Feel free to add to it.

If you would like to join this WikiProject for developing user scripts and Wikipedia's JavaScript-related pages, please add your username here:

All JavaScript-related articles should be listed in the Index of JavaScript-related articles. If you find any that are not, please list them.

All JavaScript-related articles should also be listed either in the Draft:Outline of JavaScript, or in one of the lists listed in that outline. If you find any that are not, please list them.

Please feel free to list your new JavaScript-related articles here (newer articles at the top, please). Any new articles that have an interesting or unusual fact in them, are at least over 1,500 characters, don't have any dispute templates on them, and cite their sources, should be suggested for the Did you know? box on the Wikipedia Main Page.
