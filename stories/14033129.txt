We are pleased to announce the release of Jupyter Notebook version 5.0. This is the first major release of the Jupyter Notebook since version 4.0 and the "Big Split” of IPython and Jupyter. This release adds some long-awaited features, such as cell tagging, customizing keyboard shortcuts, copying & pasting cells between notebooks, and a more attractive default style for tables. It also comes with many improvements and bug fixes. This release does not introduce any breaking API changes.

You can install the new version of the notebook now using pip:

Or conda (it may be a few days before packages are available):

This release introduces some new features and many improvements and bug fixes, totaling about 133 closed issues, 303 merged PRs, and 9 months in the making. For complete list of changes, see the changelog.

Since IPython 2.0, it has been possible to customize keyboard shortcuts, but it involved editing your or otherwise writing code against the notebook. It’s now possible to edit keyboard shortcuts using a dialog in the Help menu. We support both emacs-like (multiple keys at once) and vim-like (sequence of key) shortcuts. The available shortcuts are currently limited to Command mode, but we invite contributors to add support for Edit mode!

Tip: You can also see keyboard shortcuts for commands in the command palette ( by default).

Cell tags are a lightweight way to customize the behavior of tools working with notebooks. We're building support for them into tools like nbconvert and nbval. To start using tags, select Tags in the View / Cell Toolbar menu in a notebook.

The new default table style is more compact and subtle and consistent with JupyterLab.

This release has been a team effort and we would like to thank the following 87 people who contributed:

We look forward to your feedback and contributions!|||
