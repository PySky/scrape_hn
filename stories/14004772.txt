I've noticed that my November posts on expression parsing with Pratt's algorithm are popular and still drawing readers.

So here's an index of them, including yesterday's update, with related links.

(1) Pratt Parsing and Precedence Climbing Are the Same Algorithm

After parsing arithmetic in OSH, I noticed that the precedence climbing algorithm is a special case of the earlier Pratt parsing algorithm. But see the update below.

I reviewed four articles, in order to motivate a different code structure.

Crockford deserves credit for reviving Pratt's algorithm, but I think his idiosyncratic style leaked into almost every future exposition of it.

In this article, I explain the code in my pratt-parsing-demo repo.

Why? I tend to use classes somewhat formally, either for dependency injection or for maintaining invariants on state. If everything's a class, then nothing is.

In November, I recommended dropping the "precedence climbing" name to avoid confusion. After looking at real code, I've changed my view.
