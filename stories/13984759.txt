There are some requirements where you may need to get the network related information  and handle them in your script, it may come often or rarely but irrespective of it, you will choose certain standard ways. For example if you want to list the number of network interface or check if an interface is up or not or let say you want to know the MAC Address if the interface, you will mostly use ifconfig command and parse the information. You will use pipes, sed, awk, grep, regex and other filter tools. You dont need all these things if you use the command ifdata.

According to the manpage ifdata it says ” get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output”
