LeEco launched its latest smartphone Le Pro 3 AI edition in April and now reportedly, the company seems to be working on their next smartphone that is named as the LeEco Le X920. Two weeks ago, leaked images of the device surfaced online and even a rumored video of the new device was also leaked, a month ago. And now, again a new set of shots of the phone, has emerged.

The newly leaked images have revealed the outlook of the handset and its key specs as well. Accordingly, the front side of the Le X920 consists of a selfie camera with an LED flash. At the back, it appears to come with a single rear camera, with a laser auto focus on top of it and a LED flash below. Additionally, a fingerprint scanner can also be viewed under the rear camera.

One of the images, features a snapshot of the ‘About Phone’ screen. Here, the name of the device has been mentioned as Le X920 and also shows that it runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS, skinned with EUI 5.6.

The device is equipped with a Snapdragon 820 chipset, a Quad-Core processor that clocks at 2.15GHz. Note that, nowadays the even the new launches are coming with a Snapdragon 835 or 821. Moreover, the device is spotted in many rumors for as much Dec 2016. Hence we could infer that the company’s ongoing financial issues, have dramatically delayed the phone’s launch.

As per the previous leaks, the phone will come with a larger 6.3-inch quad HD screen, with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels. The SoC of the device is believed to be paired with a 4GB RAM and it also sports 64GB of native storage.

Many specs are included here – the rear camera consists of 22.5MP Sony IMX318 Exmor RS sensor and for the front shooter it features an 8MP sensor for video chats and selfies. It is expected to pack a 3,700mAh battery and it doesn’t seems to have a 3.5mm audio jack.

The other leaked shots, clearly show that the manufacturer is all set for the launch of Le X920, where its stocks are piled-up. Yet, the phone has not been certified on TENAA, until now. Speculations says that the phone might be released with a price of 1388 Yuan ($201 approx).|||
