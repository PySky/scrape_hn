A little project investigating possible improvements to some hash functions for short strings

When looking at SpookyHash and t1ha hashes, I noticed this code pattern, in various forms.

It’s used to process very short pieces of data, either when the input is short, or simply at the end of a longer stream.

It felt like something could be optimized here.

So I had this idea of trying to use full-integer memory reads. Of course, one needs to avoid reading uninitialized memory - but if we detect we’re close to the page boundary, we can do it.

So I implemented a 16- and 8- byte version of this code, just for fun.

MZ versions are pretty good, except for MZ8 on 0..1 byte inputs - hello, branch predictors?|||
