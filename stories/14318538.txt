2. Where the hell did the word come from?

For this technique to work , you should by heart some important root words. You can view the important list of root words for GRE/Toefl preparation from here.

3. Am 'I' really useful:

No No! 'I' don't mean about you. 'I' here represents the word you actually see. Thats the attitude you need to have when you learn a new word.

Once you see a word, try to form a quick funny or useful sentence with that word with a real world scenario or example. Share that sentence with your friends or in a group with its usage. This will help you to build your vocabulary and helps you recollect when you try to write an essay /AWA or speak with bigger audience.

eg: Esoteric usage: Rocket science is an esoteric subject which most of us are unaware about.

Learn 5 to 10 words each day as a habit.
