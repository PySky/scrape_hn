National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine

 A WORKSHOP ON STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN ACADEMIC SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND MEDICINE

Recent media coverage of sexual harassment in science, engineering, and medicine has highlighted the fact that the processes in place to address sexual harassment in academic settings often do not function effectively, resulting in a negative impact on faculty, students, and  staff in the nation’s scientific, engineering, and medical workforce.  To address this issue, the National Academies is undertaking a study on the influence of sexual harassment in academia on the career advancement of women in the scientific, technical, and medical workforce. The study will examine the extent to which women in the fields of science, engineering, and medicine are victimized by sexual harassment in academic settings, existing information on the extent to which sexual harassment in academia negatively impacts the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women pursuing  careers in these fields, and will identify and analyze the policies, strategies, and practices that have been the most successful in preventing and addressing sexual harassment in these settings.

To advance this critical conversation, the Committee on the Impacts of Sexual Harassment in Academia convened a 1-day workshop in Washington D.C. on March 28th 2017. Distinguished scholars, educators, professional society leaders, and policy experts gathered to discuss policies, strategies, and practices for addressing sexual harassment in academia.
