Last night was the night. We had picked cable types, lengths, and inspected samples. We made a logo, built a marketing plan, negotiated fulfillment, and stood in a Walmart staring at packaging for an hour. We learned about the specification that governs power and data transmission in these magical little cables. We negotiated with factories overseas, negotiated some more, and negotiated a little more for good measure. We blogged a lot.

Finally, we were ready. It was time to place the order.

We received our invoice which detailed the order:

500 pieces of each. 8" in length (up from 6" based on feedback we received from people who used our samples). Black. We wanted to print our logo in a pattern on the cable but we didnâ€™t hit the order minimum for that (which is a firm 3000 meters of cabling, about 40x what we were ordering).|||

Last night was the night. It was time to place our first tiny cables. Just one problem: sending money to China is hard.
