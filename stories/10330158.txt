Capping off Denver Startup Week, released today was the fourth edition of the Denver Capital Matrix, a resource directory of funding sources for Denver small businesses and entrepreneurs.

“Access to capital remains one of the top challenges faced by our city’s startup and small business communities,” said Paul Washington. “There’s a very healthy mix of investment and financing resources that are supporting our entrepreneurs. To that end, we’re proud to continue sharing these leads through the Denver Capital Matrix.”

The matrix identifies nearly 400 funding sources, including traditional bank lending, venture capital firms, private equity firms, angel investors, mezzanine sources, investment banking institutions and others that have funded Colorado businesses. The matrix provides contact information and categorizes the investment focus of each listed organization.

Data sources for the Denver Capital Matrix include the National Venture Capital Association, S&P Capital IQ and the Colorado Bankers Association.
