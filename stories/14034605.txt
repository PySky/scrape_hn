Just a little over a month ago I’ve launched my “get back into web development” pet project — MyStaticPage.com. As basically all of my projects it was meant to satisfy the need I had personally (I am not a fan of synthesized “great” ideas) — I wanted to have a way to get a decent looking landing page for my personal “hub” on the web (which is ailon.org) that I can host on my own terms.

After unleashing it onto the world I got a lot of encouraging feedback, plus a bunch of requests to take it one step further — make a hosted version that doesn’t require messing with files, hosting providers, etc.

The scope of the task felt like an interesting challenge, so — challenge accepted. And now I am happy to present — My Static Page Hosted version.

So as of now there are 3 ways to use MSP:

Since setting custom domains and maintaining the sites requires some effort and expenses, and I am not really an altruist (at least when it comes to maintenance), I had to come up with some pricing structure. At the same time I’m not doing this to get rich or whatever — I just want to make ongoing maintenance worth my while and make this super affordable at the same time.

So, the list price for the MSP Hosted Plus plan is $19.99 per year(!). However, for a limited time I’m slashing that in half — so right now the price is $9.99/year — that’s $0.83/month also known as “as cheap as it gets”.

But… if you are reading this in April 2017, you can get the first year of MSP Hosted Plus for… wait for it… $1.99. Yes, that’s less than $2 for a whole *year*. Just use the coupon code HOSTEDLAUNCH when ordering.

Hope you like it and thank you for spreading the word! You have shared this post with your friends and followers, right? ;)|||
