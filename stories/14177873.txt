Simple easy .NET benchmarking for little bits of code that uses probability to give you accurate results regardless of how fast your CPU is. When you benchmark a method it will do a sample run to see how many iterations per batch it should run of your method. Then it will run batch after batch until the error percentage is below 1% (the default, this can be changed though).

The idea is that even if your CPU is insanely fast or really slow you will still get a statistically accurate result.

Run the following command in the Package Manager Console (NuGet).

Lets say you wanted to see if string.Contains was faster or slower than using a regular expression

Note: You have to provide labels for each method you want to benchmark when using this syntax

The settings must be changed before creating a benchmark.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Especially around the statistical elements.|||
