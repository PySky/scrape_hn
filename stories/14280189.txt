I love the idea of solving riddles and puzzles on a book. But I needed a way to check the answers online that your solution is correct. So I made Journal 29.

Journal 29 is a unique new way to play and interact with a book. In Journal 29 players solve riddles and puzzles, submit the answers online to get the keys to move forward. To solve the riddles and puzzles, players need to think out of the box, write down, draw, search or fold pages in order to solve those riddles right.

The need to create a book game that combines the fun of solving riddles and puzzles with the experience of interacting with a real book.

The way the book is structured provides confidence that the answers are correct before moving forward. The player cannot cheat or skip pages due to the requirement of submitting the answers online to get the keys for the next pages.
