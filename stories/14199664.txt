Amazon Web Services enjoys a healthy lead in the market for public cloud services, and it plans to hire thousands of people across engineering, sales, and support to prepare for even more growth in the future.

CB Insights released a deep-dive summary of Amazon’s overall business last week, and one stat popped out at us: there are more than 5,600 open positions for AWS roles, which represents nearly one third of all open positions across Amazon’s entire business. A sizable chunk of those jobs are in artificial intelligence research, a discipline Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos identified as a key area of investment in his annual letter to shareholders.

In February, Gartner predicted that the market for infrastructure clouds like AWS will nearly triple over the next four years, and it seems like Amazon agrees with that trajectory. CB Insights expects that AWS will continue to add new services to its public cloud like AWS Lambda and the new features discussed last week in San Francisco, identifying security investment as a particularly hot area for the company in 2017.
