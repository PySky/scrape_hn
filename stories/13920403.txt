Artifact is a design doc tool made for developers. It allows anyone to easily write and link their design docs both to each other and to source code, making it easy to track how complete their project is. Documents are revision controllable, can be rendered as a static web page and have a full suite of command line tools for searching, formatting and displaying them.

Writing detailed design documents is one of the core pillars of quality software development. Design documents are how you capture the requirements (purpose) of your project and link them to your specifications (how you will build it). They let you get your ideas on paper before writing code, and help you have fewer painful refactors. They create a reference for developers and curious users of how and why your project was developed a certain way, and make it easier to refactor your project when that becomes necessary.

Even though design documents are critical to the quality of software, there are very few tools for writing them and integrating them into the larger context of a project. Artifact aims to fill the major gap in quality best practices by making writing good design documents useful to the average developer.

First of all, artifact makes it easy to write design documents in text files and link them by just specifying their attribute. This allows developers to put their design documents under revision control, review them using regular code review tools and use all the normal text processing tools (vim, grep, sed, etc) to view, edit and refactor them. Artifact also provides some command line tools of its own.

Secondly, design documents can be linked to their implementation in source-code through a language agnostic syntax, simultaniously tracking the project completion. Once linked, anyone reading the documentation can see what specification a method is supposed to implement. They can then easily search for that specification to get an idea of the larger context, making the source code comments more self documenting.

Finally, artifact exports a beautiful rendered view of the design documents for hosting on sites like github and viewing in a web browswer (example). This completes the self documenting nature and allows anyone, even non-developers, to view the design documents of their project.

In this way, artifact aims to unify all of the other quality best practices while also making development easier and more fun.

Artifact is now feature complete for 1.0. The 0.6 release has been released and will have about a month long soak process while the tool is used by as many projects as possible. Further changes before 1.0 are not expected, but may still be necessary. After the soak, the plan is to cut the 1.0 release which will disallow backwards incompatible changes.
