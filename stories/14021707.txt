This is a parser, processor and visualiser for CGA Shape Grammars. It currently only implements a very small subset, and is certainly very buggy. It is only really tested in Chrome.

Rotate the 3d view with left-mouse button, pan with the right, zoom with the scroll wheel. Type in the box, see changes in the 3d view. Chose the things from the drop-down menus.

You grammar will be saved in localStorage, so you can come back later!

Go look at the complete CGA reference.

Have fun! If you make anything cool I'd love for you to tell me on twitter: @gromgull|||
