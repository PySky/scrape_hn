Email This will remove ads & distractions from an article and send you a nice email with just the text/images. No need to install any additional applications or login to another app just to access your bookmarks. The Chrome Extensions is available on the Chrome Web Store.

Alternately, if you want to try out the sample extension, here are the download links. After you download it, unzip the file and load it in your browser using the steps mentioned below.
