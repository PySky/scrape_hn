A telemarketing script template can drastically improve your success when making outbound prospecting calls. Here is a structure of sections you can use when creating your telemarketing script template.

Elevator Pitch

 We believe that one of the best ways for you to open a call is to share some sort of elevator pitch. This should be one to two sentences that provide a hint or glimpse of how you help your clients.

In your telemarketing script template, have a section near the top that lists out some options that you have for elevator pitch statements. Here are some examples from one of our call scripts:

Pre-Qualifying Questions

 A good telemarketing script template should have probing sales questions that determine if the prospect needs or fits well with the product that the salesperson wants to sell. Your call script template should have a section that outlines good questions to ask and here are some examples of the questions that we have in one of our scripts:

Pain Points

 A good way to communicate how you can help and sometimes get a prospect to realize that they might need what you have is to share some examples of problems or pain points that you help to fix. As a result, in your call script template, you should have a list of the pain points that you can help with and here are some examples:

Company and Product Info

 Toward the end of your telemarketing script template, you should have some key details about your company and product. These should be very quick points that enable you to communicate a high level what you have to offer or sell.|||
