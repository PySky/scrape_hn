Agile development of science depends on the continuous exchange of information between researchers (Woelfle, Olliaro & Todd, 2011). In the past, physical copies of scientific works had to be produced and distributed. Therefore, publishers needed to invest considerable resources for typesetting and printing. Since the journals were mainly financed by their subscribers, their editors not only had to decide on the scientific quality of a submitted manuscript, but also on the potential interest to their readers. The availability of globally connected computers enabled the rapid exchange of information at low cost. Yochai Benkler (2006) predicts important changes in the information production economy, which are based on three observations:

Immaterial goods such as knowledge and culture are not lost when consumed or shared—they are ‘nonrival’—, and they enable a networked information economy, which is not commercially driven (Benkler, 2006).

In some areas of science a preprint culture, i.e., a paper-based exchange system of research ideas and results, already existed when Paul Ginsparg in 1991 initiated a server for the distribution of electronic preprints—‘e-prints’—about high-energy particle theory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), USA (Ginsparg, 1994). Later, the LANL server moved with Ginsparg to Cornell University, USA, and was renamed as arXiv (Butler, 2001). Currently, arXiv (https://arxiv.org/) publishes e-prints related to physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics. Just a few years after the start of the first preprint servers, their important contribution to scientific communication was evident (Ginsparg, 1994; Youngen, 1998; Brown, 2001). In 2014, arXiv reached the impressive number of 1 million e-prints (Van Noorden, 2014). In more conservative areas, such as chemistry and biology, accepting the publishing prior peer-review took more time (Brown, 2003). A preprint server for life sciences (http://biorxiv.org/) was launched by the Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, USA, in 2013 (Callaway, 2013). PeerJ preprints (https://peerj.com/preprints/), started in the same year, accepts manuscripts from biological sciences, medical sciences, health sciences and computer sciences. The terms ‘preprints’ and ‘e-prints’ are used synonymously, since the physical distribution of preprints has become obsolete. A major drawback of preprint publishing are the sometimes restrictive policies of scientific publishers. The SHERPA/RoMEO project informs about copyright policies and self-archiving options of individual publishers (http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).

The term ‘Open Access’ (OA) was introduced 2002 by the Budapest Open Access Initiative and was defined as: “Barrier-free access to online works and other resources. OA literature is digital, online, free of charge (gratis OA), and free of needless copyright and licensing restrictions (libre OA).” (Suber, 2012) Frustrated by the difficulty to access even digitized scientific literature, three scientists founded the Public Library of Science (PLoS). In 2003, PLoS Biology was published as the first fully Open Access journal for biology (Brown, Eisen & Varmus, 2003; Eisen, 2003). Thanks to the great success of OA publishing, many conventional print publishers now offer a so-called ‘Open Access option’, i.e., to make accepted articles free to read for an additional payment by the authors. The copyright in these hybrid models might remain with the publisher, whilst fully OA usually provide a liberal license, such as the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). OA literature is only one component of a more general open philosophy, which also includes the access to scholarships, software, and data (Willinsky, 2005). Interestingly, there are several different ‘schools of thought’ on how to understand and define Open Science, as well the position that any science is open by definition, because of its objective to make generated knowledge public (Fecher & Friesike, 2014).

In a recent study, the article processing charges (APCs) for research intensive universities in the USA and Canada were estimated to be about 1,800 USD for fully OA journals and 3,000 USD for hybrid OA journals (Solomon & Björk, 2016). PeerJ (https://peerj.com/), an OA journal for biological and computer sciences launched in 2013, drastically reduced the publishing cost, offering its members a life-time publishing plan for a small registration fee (Van Noorden, 2012); alternatively the authors can choose to pay an APC of $1,095 USD, which may be cheaper, if multiple co-authors participate. Examples such as the Journal of Statistical Software (JSS, https://www.jstatsoft.org/) and eLife (https://elifesciences.org/) demonstrate the possibility of completely community-supported OA publications. Figure 1 compares the APCs of different OA publishing business models. Article Processing Charge (APCs) that authors have to pay for with different Open Access (OA) publishing models. JSS and eLife are peer-reviewed and indexed by Thomson Reuters. Both journals are located in the Q1 quality quartile in all their registered subject categories of the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (http://www.scimagojr.com/), demonstrating that high-quality publications can be produced without charging the scientific authors or readers. In 2009, a study was carried out concerning the “Economic Implications of Alternative Scholarly Publishing Models”, which demonstrates an overall societal benefit by using OA publishing models (Houghton et al., 2009). In the same report, the real publication costs are evaluated. The relative costs of an article for the publisher are presented in Fig. 2. Estimated publishing cost for a ‘hybrid’ journal (conventional with Open Access option). Data from Houghton et al. (2009). Conventional publishers justify their high subscription or APC prices with the added value; for example, journalism (stated in the graphics as ‘non-article processing’). However, stakeholder profits, which could be as high as 50%, also must be considered, and are withdrawn from the science budget (Van Noorden, 2013). Generally, the production costs of an article could be roughly divided into commercial and academic/technical costs (Fig. 2). For nonmarket production, the commercial costs such as margins/profits, management etc. can be drastically reduced. Hardware and services for hosting an editorial system, such as Open Journal Systems of the Public Knowledge Project (https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) can be provided by public institutions. Employed scholars can perform editor and reviewer activities without additional cost for the journals. Nevertheless, ‘article processing’, which includes the manuscript handling during peer review and production represents the most expensive part. Therefore, we investigated a strategy for the efficient formatting of scientific manuscripts.

Generally speaking, a scientific manuscript is composed of contents and formatting. While the content, i.e., text, figures, tables, citations etc., may remain the same between different publishing forms and journal styles, the formatting can be very different. Most publishers require the formatting of submitted manuscripts in a certain format. Ignoring this Guide for Authors, (for example, by submitting a manuscript with a different reference style), gives a negative impression with a journal’s editorial staff. Manuscripts which are too carelessly prepared can even provoke a straight ‘desk-reject’ (Volmer & Stokes, 2016). Currently DOC(X), LATEX and/ or PDF file formats are the most frequently used formats for journal submission platforms. However, even if the content of a submitted manuscript might be accepted during the peer review ‘as is’, the format still needs to be adjusted to the particular publication style in the production stage. For the electronic distribution and archiving of scientific works, which is gaining more and more importance, additional formats (EPUB, (X)HTML, JATS) need to be generated. Table 1 lists the file formats which are currently the most relevant ones for scientific publishing. Although the content elements of documents, such as title, author, abstract, text, figures, tables, etc., remain the same, the syntax of the file formats is rather different. Table 2 demonstrates some simple examples of differences in different markup languages. Documents with the commonly used Office Open XML (DOCX Microsoft Word files) and OpenDocument (ODT LibreOffice) file formats can be opened in a standard text editor after unzipping. However, content and formatting information is distributed into various folders and files. Practically speaking, those file formats require the use of special word processing software. From a writer’s perspective, the use of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) programs such as Microsoft Word, WPS Office or LibreOffice might be convenient, because the formatting of the document is directly visible. But the complicated syntax specifications often result in problems when using different software versions and for collaborative writing. Simple conversions between file formats can be difficult or impossible. In a worst-case scenario, ‘old’ files cannot be opened any more for lack of compatible software. In some parts of the scientific community therefore LATEX, a typesetting program in plain text format, is very popular. With LATEX, documents with highest typographic quality can be produced. However, the source files are cluttered with LATEX commands and the source text can be complicated to read. Causes of compilation errors in LATEX are sometimes difficult to find. Therefore, LATEX is not very user friendly, especially for casual writers or beginners. In academic publishing, it is additionally desirable to create different output formats from the same source text: For the publishing of a book, with a print version in PDF and an electronic version in EPUB. For the distribution of a seminar script, with an online version in HTML and a print version in PDF. For submitting a journal manuscript for peer-review in DOCX, as well as a preprint version with another journal style in PDF. For archiving and exchanging article data using the Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) (National Information Standards Organization, 2012), a standardized format developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Some of the tasks can be performed with LATEX, but an integrated solution remains a challenge. Several programs for the conversion between documents formats exist, such as the e-book library program calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/). But the results of such conversions are often not satisfactory and require substantial manual corrections. Therefore, we were looking for a solution that enables the creation of scientific manuscripts in a simple format, with the subsequent generation of multiple output formats. The need for hybrid publishing has been recognized outside of science (Kielhorn, 2011), but the requirements specific to scientific publishing have not been addressed so far. Therefore, we investigated the possibility to generate multiple publication formats from a simple manuscript source file.|||

The timely publication of scientific results is essential for dynamic advances in science. The ubiquitous availability of computers which are connected to a global network made the rapid and low-cost distribution of information through electronic channels possible. New concepts, such as Open Access publishing and preprint servers are currently changing the traditional print media business towards a community-driven peer production. However, the cost of scientific literature generation, which is either charged to readers, authors or sponsors, is still high. The main active participants in the authoring and evaluation of scientific manuscripts are volunteers, and the cost for online publishing infrastructure is close to negligible. A major time and cost factor is the formatting of manuscripts in the production stage. In this article we demonstrate the feasibility of writing scientific manuscripts in plain markdown (MD) text files, which can be easily converted into common publication formats, such as PDF, HTML or EPUB, using Pandoc. The simple syntax of Markdown assures the long-term readability of raw files and the development of software and workflows. We show the implementation of typical elements of scientific manuscripts—formulas, tables, code blocks and citations—and present tools for editing, collaborative writing and version control. We give an example on how to prepare a manuscript with distinct output formats, a DOCX file for submission to a journal, and a LATEX/PDF version for deposition as a PeerJ preprint. Further, we implemented new features for supporting ‘semantic web’ applications, such as the ‘journal article tag suite’—JATS, and the ‘citation typing ontology’—CiTO standard. Reducing the work spent on manuscript formatting translates directly to time and cost savings for writers, publishers, readers and sponsors. Therefore, the adoption of the MD format contributes to the agile production of open science literature. Pandoc Scholar is freely available from https://github.com/pandoc-scholar.
