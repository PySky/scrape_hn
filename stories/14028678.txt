This help only covers the parts of GLSL ES that are relevant for Shadertoy. For the complete specification please have a look at GLSL ES specification Image shaders: fragColor is used as output channel. It is not, for now, mandatory but recommended to leave the alpha channel to 1.0.Sound shaders: the mainSound() function returns a vec2 containing the left and right (stereo) sound channel wave data.|||
