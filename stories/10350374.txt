Curated content is all the rage in 2015 and it makes sense that if you’re the main source for content on other people’s sites (OK, mostly Buzzfeed) you should get in on the action, and that’s likely Reddit’s thinking with the launch of a new site.

Called Upvoted, the new site runs as a mix between Digg and Buzzfeed in that it includes a range of content broadly representative of those covered on the core Reddit site itself.

Interestingly, rather than simply republishing content posted on Reddit with little or no added comment (again see Buzzfeed), Upvoted sees editorial curation complete with a set of writers explaining what the story is about, and even on occasion adding to it.

Poorly though, given Reddit’s roots, to quote Gawker on the matter:

The pitch from Reddit about the new site doesn’t make things all that much better, with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian writing (unsurprisingly on Upvoted itself) that the intent of the new site is “to give the stories of Reddit—from the seemingly ordinary to the extraordinary—the creative space to expand, breathe, and grow,” implying that they currently don’t have that opportunity on Reddit itself.

“Over this past year, we’ve talked to hundreds of Redditors who have been so excited to see their ideas and stories reach even more people and we’re grateful for the chance to expand this further,” he continued.

The move makes a lot of sense for Reddit given how other sites (Buzzfeed) have been repackaging content for their own profit and traffic for years; why shouldn’t Reddit get a slice of that traffic and profit as well?

Despite the fact it’s perhaps a little tame at this stage, Upvoted does have the potential to go well as it matures, and more importantly for Reddit provide ample grounds for internet advertising, something the company has struggled with.

All that said a site that relies on free user contributions and participation for its success, packing that content up then allowing no comment on it is rude and potentially a big snub to the millions of people who have made Reddit what it is today.

Upvoted went live Tuesday night and can be viewed at www.upvoted.com.|||
