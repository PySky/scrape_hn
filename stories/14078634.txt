I was thinking of a word beginning with the alphabet ‘I’ and couldn’t find a better word than the alphabet itself. I. This word seems like the shortest tree with the deepest roots. The word is full of questions as well as answers. It has the power to make any wise man spend his lifetime searching for its meaning, and it also has the power to make any idiot spend his lifetime claiming he knows all that there is for knowing.

In all the past stories that I’ve written in this series were narrated from the I’s point of view. I was the hero. I was the villain. I was the victim. I was the winner. I was the dead. I was the survivor. I was jealous. I was kind. I was joyful. I was depressed. I lived through the emotions. I was the happy ending. I was the broken heart. I was the story. I was the storyteller.

Who am I? I am an infinite set of possibilities, that cannot be contained or defined by a single word. I am the sunrise in the morning. I am the sunset in the evening. I am the birds chirping. I am the leaves falling. Today, I might be the one you despise. Tomorrow, I could be the one you like.

At nights, I stay awake, talking to the universe, trying to find the purpose of my existence. Universe usually tells me, “You are nobody. Just one tiny lab rat among billions. Your purpose is either to prove or disprove that you’re the ultimate life that ever can be in the entire universe.”

“But what is the ultimate life?” I ask.

“The one who stays alive in the end is the possessor of the ultimate life. You are just one tiny gear in a huge machine. Your life’s purpose is just to not die.”

In the insult, I found the elixir. The only thing I must remember is to not die. And when I’ll not die, I’ll win. I don’t have to write a poem. I am not a poet. I am the poem.|||
