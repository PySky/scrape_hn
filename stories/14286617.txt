BRUSSELS, BELGIUM (MAY 7, 2017) (REUTERS) – More than 60 percent of voters have cast their votes for Emmanuel Macron in the French elections according to polls carried out on Sunday (May 7) say Belgian media.



Opinion polls predicted that the 39-year-old former economy minister Emmanuel Macron would win the five-year presidency, seeing off the National Front’s Marine Le Pen after an election campaign full of scandal and upsets.

Voting was not due to end until 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), but Belgian media published what they said were surveys taken on Sunday by four unnamed pollsters among people who had voted or intended to vote.

The Belgian public broadcaster RTBF said the surveys put Macron’s share of the vote at between 62 and 67 percent.

In a bar near the European institutions in Brussels, French expatriates said they were happy with the results published by Belgian media.

The information could not be verified by Reuters. Pollsters are not allowed to publish election-day surveys in France before voting closes.|||
