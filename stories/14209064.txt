In parts of the Bay Area, $105,350 is 'low income'

If you're among the Bay Area residents complaining about the rising costs of living, here's another report to solidify that view: In parts of the Bay Area, a six-figure income qualifies as "low income."

That report comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which helps determine who's eligible for subsidized housing.

In HUD's latest numbers, San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo show that an income of $105,350 for a family of four can be counted as low income. In those same counties an income of $65,800 is "very low," while $39,500 is "extremely low."

In other areas such as Alameda and Contra Costa counties, $80,400 is considered low-income for a family of four.

These figures could further feed the notion that residents are looking to leave the Bay Area for cheaper areas. A recent poll showed that more Bay Area residents are considering that option: 19 percent of those surveyed "strongly agreed" that they were likely to move out of the Bay Area in the next few years, while another 21 percent "somewhat agreed" they would move. (Only forty-six percent disagreed, or didn't know whether they would move.)

These new numbers mark an increase in the figures from last year. San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties listed $98,500 as their low income threshold last year.
