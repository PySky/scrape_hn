Illness and disease affect us all and often leave us feeling helpless. This is an opportunity to take action and shape the future of healthcare no matter who you are or what your background is.

When you join Project Baseline, you're not just participating in research. You have something to offer that no one else can: your unique history, genetics, and way of life. Every data point, every survey answer, and every health test is a way to stake your claim in the map of human health and leave a lasting contribution.

Together, we'll explore new frontiers of science and push the limits of how humanity understands and treats disease.|||

Project Baseline is the quest to collect comprehensive health data and use it as a map and compass, pointing the way to disease prevention.
