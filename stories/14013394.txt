Some very reliable studies suggest that the mean time wasted by a developer on choosing a variable name is 4.2 hours every day. This is a collosal waste of their time, when they could be working on solving a problem as grave as non-existence of ephemeral picture-sharing capability on a social network. We couldn't let this happen, of course. Hence, VNaaS.

To unlock the premium features of this service, you need to come down to our office and show us how to invert a binary tree on a whiteboard. There is no cost -- it's all free since it's a serverless service (yes). But yeah, you need to show us how to invert that tree. You're not a dev worthy enough of your IDE if you cannot do that.

Cuz if you are, you might wanna try DoSelect for assessing candidates objectively in a better way. Tests on DoSelect tell you how good a developer is on different skills, if they write good, clean code so your existing devs are happy, and what kind of stuff they've done apart from that particular test that's relevant to you -- all at one place! Check this link out. Or give us a shout out on twitter if you'd like!
