Instagram is growing faster than it ever has before.

The photo and video app, which is owned by Facebook, now has 700 million monthly active users, adding 100 million new users in just over four months. That’s faster than the six months it took the company to jump from 500 million to 600 million users, which was faster than the nine months it took to jump from 400 million to 500 million.

So things have picked up significantly in the past year.

That’s great news for Facebook, because Instagram is the company’s best weapon to fend off Snapchat, which is the greatest threat to Facebook since Google tried (and failed) to get into social networking.

Facebook still doesn’t share how much revenue Instagram generates for the company, but it’s believed to be billions of dollars annually. Facebook reports Q1 earnings next week.|||

It took the company just four months to add 100 million new accounts.
