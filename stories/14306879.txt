Unlike all the other controllers in the world, Hapto doesn’t only vibrate, but also gives you a pushing effect. And that’s precisely what Hapto simulates perfectly realistically!

It also has finger-tracking, which reflects any of your finger movements: grab, pull, push, and tickle in VR! And feel. Feel! FEEL!|||

At Hapto we believe that a virtual realm is as immersive as you make it. 
This is why our unique wireless motion controller is designed so that you 
can not only move around, but also feel objects and surfaces within a 
virtual environment. Harnessing the latest haptic feedback technologies, 
Hapto enables you to fully explore VR using all of your senses.
