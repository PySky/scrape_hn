Important tasks need to happen reliably in the background

Is It Working lets you set up a 'Checkin' with a timeout that suits your task

When your task completes succesfully, it makes an https call to the Checkin

If your task doesn't check in as expected - Is It Working will tell you

This is incredibly easy to integrate with Cron Scripts, or any other regular or scheduled task that has to run on your system

For example, for a Cron Script. Just add the check in after your task

This is perfect for monitoring Cron tasks, but any regular task can be monitored in the same way. Just make an https call to confirm that the task ran succesfully

You can optionally add a message when your script checks in. This might include information like the time to run the script, the number of emails sent, or any other output from your script. See the documentation for more info

If your script might fail, or you want to notify about an error, you can can send a status code with your checkin. Any status other than zero will trigger and alert. See the documentation for more info|||
