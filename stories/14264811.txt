It’s so true, that we as designers are guilty, on occasion of looking at the guy/girl next to us, and thinking their work is the greatest thing that’s ever graced a users screen, and that our work is in some way inferior to theirs. Stop doubting your abilities, and the work that you create. Keep doing what you’re doing, your own way, your own style. There are hundreds, no thousands of people out there that think the stuff you’re creating is awesome. Don’t compare to the next person, or think less of your work. Be a better UI Designer by not comparing yourself.

If you’re just starting out on this voyage of design discovery there may be times when you think to yourself ‘Am I good enough?’ , ‘That designer is so much better than me’ , ‘My work sucks’ . We are our own worst critics, we really are from time, to time.|||
