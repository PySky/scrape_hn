We are very excited to announce the release of our latest tool we call Fuzzer. The Fuzzer is a general purpose brute-force and fuzz-testing tool which allows you to find vulnerabilities quickly and easily with the help of the same powerful request editor we introduced in our existing tools such as Rest.

The Fuzzer is currently in Beta. Follow us on twitter and let us know what do you think.|||
