Today, two new global satellite imagery layers are live for tracing on OpenStreetMap, courtesy of DigitalGlobe. Now, mappers have even more sources of high quality, recent imagery layers to trace, identify, and validate roads, places, and buildings to continue to expand this free and open database of the Earth’s features.

Now all of Forshaga, Sweden is in high definition

Mapbox is powering the system that keeps these new satellite imagery layers running and we’re still supporting development of OpenStreetMap’s iD Editor. You’ll notice that today, iD has new imagery that is ready for tracing!

No longer missing from the map: Ilebo, Democratic Republic of Congo
