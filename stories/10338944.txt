We’re happy to announce that the new Saasmetrics API is now live.

The API allows you to build your own integrations and connect Saasmetrics to any system or application you want. By using our API you can automatically input data to Saasmetrics so you don’t need to spend your time typing data manually, avoid typos and human errors, and have constantly updated numbers and metrics.

The API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. Please remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website’s client-side code.
