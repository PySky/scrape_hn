Looking at machine language, you can go back to the mid-1800s to the daughter of the poet, Lord Bryon. Ada Lovelace, the Countess of Lovelace, was a mathematician known for her work on Charles Babbage's analytical engine. She's considered to be the first person to create an algorithm for a machine.

Today in 2017, in what sounds like a scene from the lab in Westworld, a non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company, Open AI Lab, is teaching AI to create its own language; and the Human to Robots Lab at Brown University has created an algorithm that enables a robot called Iorek to ask for clarification if it doesn't undertand what you asked for.

These two new pieces of research aren't exactly the same, but they have one common denominator: language.

The Open AI Lab published a blog post that reported they were able to teach AI agents to create a basic compositional language. The idea is that real or true language understanding will come from agents that learn words in combination with how they affect the world, rather than just looking for patterns in text. In the research, they used reinforcement learning (think Pavlov's dog) and put the agents into a set of situations/worlds. In those worlds, they gave them the ability to communicate as well as goals to reach. To reach those goals they had to create a shared language.

Researchers hope the results from this research of 'growing a language' will create an opportunity to develop machines with their own language that's tied to their own lived experience.

In the Human to Robots Lab, led by Stephanie Tellex, the researchers created an algorithm that let Iorek receive speech commands and process information from human gestures. This is how humans communicate, if we want something we point to it.|||
