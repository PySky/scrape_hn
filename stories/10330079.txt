There’s a lot to love about Seattle, but we think food is one of our city’s best traits. That’s why we’re thrilled to announce the local launch of UberEATS — an on-demand meal service that delivers hometown favorites in 10 minutes or less. Our curated menu features dishes from the spots you can’t live without and the ones you’ve always wanted to try. With UberEATS, we’re making it as easy to order in as it is to request an Uber.

Beginning on Wednesday, October 7th, UberEATS will be available on weekdays from 11am – 2pm in Downtown, Pioneer Square, Belltown, Lower Queen Anne, South Lake Union and Capitol Hill. You’ll always have several meal options to choose from, and we’ll change our menu daily. Our featured dishes include drunken chicken from Monsoon, pulled pork from Skillet Diner, and a trio of salads from Volunteer Park Cafe, among other great options. Dishes usually range from $8-$12.

We look forward to serving up UberEATS in Seattle!|||
