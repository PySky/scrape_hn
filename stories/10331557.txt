As Serverius is one of the 3 largest datacenter networks in the Netherlands we have up to 1Tbps capacity to defend our users against large DDoS attacks, such as SYN flood and DNS amplifications. In the past 12 months we defended against multiple 600Gbps+ IoT attacks what makes us one of the largest scrubbing environments in Europe. Beside this large volume attacks we were also able to protect 40Gbps Layer 7 attacks.

But beside of capacity also high performance is needed to be able to filter Layer 7 attacks and keep the latency in general for all users really perfect. Because Serverius is using a ultra fast carrier hardware scrubbing environment known as the “DDoS Protection Cloud”, the DDoS cleaning is performed through the full infrastructure. Therefore it’s not some a single scrubbing box what will be doing the job, many routers, switches, and also carriers will work as one and provide the best latency possible.|||
