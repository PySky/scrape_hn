We caught up with Megan Heuer, Vice President of Research at Global B2B Advisory Firm SiriusDecisions for her perspective on the world of Account-Based Marketing, Account-Based Selling, and Account-Based Everything.

ABM is a fast- emerging discipline with the potential to align your sales and marketing team around a strategy that’s optimized for the biggest, most important deals. But, ABM is not a magic wand. Instead, it’s a powerful combination of people, process and technology that, deployed intelligently, will out-perform every other demand generation initiative in your company. We asked Megan what some of the most common obstacles are to ABM success:

“ABM can be the victim of its own success. If you start with one or two people being asked to ‘take on’ ABM and it works really well, then Sales will want more. But marketing leaders can be reluctant to shift resources away from the things that they’ve always been doing. When that happens, ABM marketers aren’t able to scale their teams or their work as quickly as they’d like and they get a bit frustrated. It’s a real issue.”

So, what happens in unsuccessful ABM programs?

“Once in a while we see a team that doesn’t get off on the right foot. Maybe they made assumptions about what Sales want, rather than going and really working with Sales. Then they walk in with a beautiful account profile and say ‘Happy Birthday’ and Sales says, ‘What the heck is this?’.”

“Marketers can put Sales a bit on the defensive by going in and saying, ‘We’re here to help, give me all of your account plans and I’ll come back to you with a marketing plan.’ Sales isn’t accustomed to handing over their account plans (and maybe haven’t been so diligent about building them) and all of a sudden they’re being asked to turn over the keys to the kingdom and that sort of puts Sales on the defensive.”|||
