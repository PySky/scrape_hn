The Society Thrives on Incompetence and So Do You | Equality is Your Worst Fear and That’s Okay

People are always talking about others doing well, them being happy for them, wanting equality, how they wish everyone had a respectable job, how they wish no one was a mere factory worker, and so so much more. I think all of that is absolute rubbish. No one in their right mind would want true equality. What they really mean, is that they want a few people to earn just a bit more than the others in their category. They do not want everyone to be better off because the effects could be devastating to them.

That applies especially to the rich. To better understand what I’m trying to say, let’s take an example.

This is Albert. He’s a pretentious gentleman with a lot of money. 💰 💰 💰

Or so he says. You see, Albert is the proud owner of a grand factory. And there are hundreds of workers in his factory. And very few of them have actually graduated from college. The rest are the underprivileged, picked up to work in his factory. The ones who did graduate, aren’t workers in the assembly line, they are managers and the sort.

Imagine if all the workers had instead been through college, graduated and all became managers, or better, in companies. Who would work for him?

Okay, okay, that’s all great. But what if you aren’t some big factory owner with the uneducated working for you?

We all buy groceries. After all, it’s a need. You walk into the store, grab what you want, maybe ask some staff member where the cereal isle is, if you’re new, then head to the checkout line. When it’s finally your turn, you put your items on the shelf and the guy at the till scans your items and gives you your bill. On the way home, you realise you’re low on fuel.

You turn into the nearest petroleum pump and load up.

Now let’s read that again, but with a few alterations:

We all buy groceries. After all, it’s a need. You walk into the store, grab what you want, maybe ask some underprivileged staff member where the cereal isle is, if you’re new, then head to the checkout line. When it’s finally your turn, you put your items on the shelf and the guy (who’s doing this job because he needs the money and this job requires virtually no qualifications) at the till scans your items and gives you your bill. On the way home, you realise you’re low on fuel. You turn into the nearest petroleum pump (with a lot of uneducated workers) and load up.

Take a long, hard look at those words in bold. Think. What if all of them were educated? What if all of them too had good, and respectable jobs? Who would help you find your favourite cereal (that cereal may not even exist due to lack of workers!)? Who would check out your items? Who would help you fill your tank? In fact, there may not even be a grocery store or petrol pump (for lack of workers).

You may not be getting all your favourite brands either. There would be no one to work in the factory to make them! Human civilisation, as we know it, may come to a standstill.

Now ask yourself the question:

Imagine this utopia. Every last person on earth is educated. Therefore, no one is prepared to work as a ‘lowly’ factory worker (in fact, as I have explained, they are rather valuable). Instead, they all seek jobs such as the post of a manager (or even better). But, there are only so many posts for manager available. This would lead to unemployment. And unemployment is not good for an economy. It could cause it to collapse.

Besides, there would be no one to manage. Therefore, no manager post. Therefore no managing director post. Therefore no CEO post. Therefore no company whatsoever. Once again, unwittingly leading the human race to a standstill.
