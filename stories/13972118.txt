SpaceX looks to make history on Thursday by re-flying a Falcon 9 first stage for the first time.

Elon Musk’s company is targeting a 6 p.m. EDT liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The booster is carrying the SES-10 communications satellite.

The refurbished first stage was used to launch a Dragon supply ship to the International Space Station last April. The stage landed on a drone ship off shore.

A brief static fire of the first stage’s 9 Merlin 1-D engines is scheduled for today.|||
