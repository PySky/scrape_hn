Hillsboro-based SureID laid off a substantial number of its employees Monday, cutbacks the company says were triggered by a change in its corporate strategy.

The Hillsboro company did not say how many people lost their jobs, or how many of those cuts are in Oregon. Employees indicated the number is in the dozens, likely well over 100.

"SureID has rebalanced its workforce to meet the changing requirements of its clients, and to pioneer new, high value segments of the booming identity industry," said Jim Robell, the company's president and chief operating officer. "SureID is positioning itself in priority areas including digital identity and fingerprinting solutions for commercial, consumer and government."

Last month, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported the U.S. Navy is ditching SureID's RAPIDGate technology in favor of an alternative identification technology. In 2013, the Department of Defense Inspector General concluded RAPIDGate had allowed people onto installations who were ineligible because of past convictions.

Formerly known as Eid Passport, privately held SureID helps companies, military installations and other government agencies verify the identities of people seeking access to their facilities. The company had 545 employees in 2015, including contractors.

This week's cuts are the latest sign of a slowdown in Oregon's tech industry, which boomed for several years following the Great Recession but added no jobs in the last several months of 2016. Overall, though, Oregon's job market remains quite robust, with the jobless rate at a historic low of 3.8 percent.|||
