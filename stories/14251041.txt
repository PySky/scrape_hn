CLIF provides a common foundation for creating C++ wrapper generators for various languages.

It consists of four parts:

The parser converts a language-friendly C++ API description to the language-agnostic internal format and passes it to the Matcher.

The matcher parses selected C++ headers with Clang (LLVM's C++ compiler) and collects type information. That info is passed to the Generator.

The generator emits C++ source code for the wrapper.

The generated wrapper needs to be built according with language extension rules. Usually that wrapper will call into the Runtime.

The runtime C++ library holds type conversion routines that are specific to each target language but are the same for every generated wrapper.

See complete implementation of a Python wrapper generator in the subdirectory. Both Python 2 and 3 are supported.

The steps below are in but outlined here for clarification. The install script sets up a Python virtual environment where it installs CLIF.

Checkout LLVM and Clang source trees (the exact SVN version as specified here is required[^ver]) We keep it separate of the CLIF tree to avoid pip unwanted copying. mkdir svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk@299535 llvm llvm/tools svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk@299535 clang ln -sf clif Build and install the CLIF backend. If you use Ninja instead of your build will go significantly faster. It is used by Chromium, LLVM et al. Look at for the directory setup and proper ...flags... to supply the command here: Builds must be done outside of the LLVM tree. mkdir ../../build_matcher ../../build_matcher cmake ...flags... /llvm make clif-matcher make install Replace the cmake and make commands with these to use Ninja: If the clif-matcher build target is not found, check that you created the correct symlink in the previous step. The CLIF backend builds as part of an LLVM build. Get back to your CLIF python checkout and install it using pip.

[^ver]: That version is guaranteed to work. Older versions likely do not work (they lack some APIs); later versions might work, at your own risk.

INSTALL.sh will build and install CLIF for Python (and LLVM Clang as an internal tool) to your system by default in and .
