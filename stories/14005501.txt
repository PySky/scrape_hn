Redbench is a Go package that allows for bootstrapping benchmarks for servers using a custom implementation of the Redis protocol. It provides the same inputs and outputs as the redis-benchmark tool.

The purpose of this library is to provide benchmarking for Redcon compatible servers such as Tile38, but also works well for Redis operations that are not covered by the tool such as the commands, custom lua scripts, or Redis Modules.

To start using Redbench, install Go and run :

This will retrieve the library.

The following example will run a benchmark for the commands on a server at 127.0.0.1:6379.

Which is similar to executing:

For a more complete example, check out tile38-benchmark from the Tile38 project.
