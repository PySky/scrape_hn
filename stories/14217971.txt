Debian 9.0 "Stretch" has seen UEFI Secure Boot support no longer being considered a release blocker but is now just a stretch goal for this upcoming release.Debian developer Jonathan Wiltshire shared that while Secure Boot support was planned for Debian 9.0, it might not happen now due to short on time and resources. Secure Boot might still work its way though into a later Debian 9.x update.Hopefully most Linux users have already disabled UEFI Secure Boot functionality on their systems so they won't have to worry about it still missing, years after most other distributions joined the SecureBoot bandwagon.There are also some other release bits shared in today's update. As of now there are 143 RC bugs affecting this next release. A release date for Debian 9.0 has yet to be determined while DDs continue being busy fixing bugs and testing.|||
