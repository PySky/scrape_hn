It's a holdover from the Netscape days:

Missing digits are treated as 0[...]. An incorrect digit is simply interpreted as 0. For example the values #F0F0F0, F0F0F0, F0F0F, #FxFxFx and FxFxFx are all the same.

It is from the blog post A little rant about Microsoft Internet Explorer's color parsing which covers it in great detail, including varying lengths of color values, etc.

If we apply the rules in turn from the blog post, we get the following:

Which gives the following result:

Here's an example demonstrating the attribute in action, to produce this "amazing" colour swatch:

This also answers the other part of the question; why does produce a yellow colour? Well, if we apply the rules, the string is:

Which gives a light yellow gold colour. As the string starts off as 9 characters, we keep the second C this time around hence it ends up in the final colour value.

I originally encountered this when someone pointed out you could do and, well, it comes out brown.|||
