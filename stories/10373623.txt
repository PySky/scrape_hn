A series of small earthquakes have been recorded across northern Oklahoma, following two moderate earthquakes in the area on Saturday.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) reported that nine quakes ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 3.7 were recorded between 5.07pm on Saturday and 5.27am on Sunday. No injuries or damage were reported. Geologists say damage is not likely in quakes below magnitude 4.0.

The latest seismic activity came after a 4.5 magnitude temblor on Saturday afternoon near Cushing and a 4.4 magnitude quake on Saturday morning south-west of Medford.

The Oklahoma Geological Survey has said it is likely that many recent earthquakes in the state have been triggered by the injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations.

Cushing is home to the world’s most important crude oil storage hub, which is used to settle futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Cushing emergency management director Bob Noltensmeyer said on Sunday that no significant damage was found at the oil facility, only “shattered nerves”.

“It’s kind of frustrating and irritating,” Noltensmeyer said, “because you never know when they’re going to happen.”|||
