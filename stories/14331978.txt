Many thanks to timpossible for posting a way of hiding this stupid message. Even though I'd opened that drop-down menu I somehow didn't notice the "hide when empty" option.

But Google, seriously. Please get rid of this stupid, lame, and annoying message. It's not just the way it wastes so much screen space, but do you have *any* idea how poorly worded this is?

Consider the following:

1) I assume that "Woohoo" is suposed to be an expression of delight? How the h-e-double-toothpicks do you know that I'm *happy* that there are no important messages? How do you know that I'm not waiting for a specific, very important message, and I'm very *un*happy that it hasn't arrived? Maybe I'm worried about somebody? Maybe somebody owes me money?

2) Please do a Google search for "Woohoo". I'll save you the trouble, here is the top result:

A term for "sex" in the Sims 2 simulation game. In order to keep it rated "T" for teen, Maxis needed to use "woohoo" instead of "sex"

Now, do you *still* think this kind of childish wording is a good idea?|||
