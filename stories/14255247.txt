I remember back in college, having to buy all my textbooks for the semester.

It was expensive. I even sold my coveted Nintendo 64, along with all of my games once just to cover the cost of a few textbooks.

It was painful, but also removed an obstacle to getting my work done.

I also remember a big display of Cliff’s Notes in the book store.

College was mostly fun but reading textbooks was not.

So, sometimes I’d get the Cliff’s Notes so I could get the basics and have a little more time for some fun.

Because I want you to have more fun too, I put together the “Cliff’s Notes” (so to speak) for Windows Server 2016 Licensing.

Because, sometimes we don’t want to read the book.
