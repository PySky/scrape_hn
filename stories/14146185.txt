Encase your legs in nylons,

 Bestride your hills with pylons

 O age without a soul;

 Away with gentle willows

 And all the elmy billows

 That through your valleys roll.

Let's say goodbye to hedges

 And roads with grassy edges

 And winding country lanes;

 Let all things travel faster

 Where motor car is master

 Till only Speed remains.

Destroy the ancient inn-signs

 But strew the roads with tin signs

 'Keep Left,' 'M4,' 'Keep Out!'

 Command, instruction, warning,

 Repetitive adorning

 The rockeried roundabout;

For every raw obscenity

 Must have its small 'amenity,'

 Its patch of shaven green,

 And hoardings look a wonder

 In banks of floribunda

 With floodlights in between.

Leave no old village standing

 Which could provide a landing

 For aeroplanes to roar,

 But spare such cheap defacements

 As huts with shattered casements

 Unlived-in since the war.

Let no provincial High Street

 Which might be your or my street

 Look as it used to do,

 But let the chain stores place here

 Their miles of black glass facia

 And traffic thunder through.

And if there is some scenery,

 Some unpretentious greenery,

 Surviving anywhere,

 It does not need protecting

 For soon we'll be erecting

 A Power Station there.

When all our roads are lighted

 By concrete monsters sited

 Like gallows overhead,

 Bathed in the yellow vomit

 Each monster belches from it,

 We'll know that we are dead.|||
