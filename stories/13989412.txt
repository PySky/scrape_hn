Turned my computer on and logged in. Skype ran on startup, as usual, but came up with this page. Screenshot

 Looks like an infected/malicious ad or compromised ad network. It's prompting me to download "FlashPlayer.hta" from a sketchy-looking site.

 The screenshot I'm showing is without me interacting with Skype or clicking on anything at all.

Edit: To block ads in Skype, add these two sites to your IE Restricted Sites. The ad banner space will still be there, but it'll block the ad content:

Edit2: Contacted Skype support, they said there's no way Skype ads would do this, and it's a virus totally unrelated to Skype on my computer :/ Of course, I know it's their ads, not anything on my end.|||
