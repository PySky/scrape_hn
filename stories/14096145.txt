Deutsche Post DHL Group continues to focus consistently on electro-mobility and its self-developed StreetScooter electric van. In light of the strong customer demand and the vehicles required for the company's own operations in Germany and the rest of Europe, the logistics provider will double the production capacity of its own electric vehicles from 10,000 to as many as 20,000 by the end of the year. For this purpose, the company will commission another production location in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Group will announce further details in due course.

In addition, the company is now also selling its own electric vehicles - which have so far been optimized for postal operations and delivery purposes - to third parties. At least half of this year's annual production is planned for external prospective buyers of the vehicles. Deutsche Post DHL Group sees municipal authorities, strategic partners and large fleet customers in Germany and the rest of Europe in particular as potential buyers for starters. The company aims to at least double - from the current number of about 2,500 vehicles - its own StreetScooter fleet for letter and parcel deliveries this year.

"The large demand for the StreetScooter and our own ambitious climate-protection goals have encouraged us to further expand our commitment in the area of electro-mobility and to also make our expertise available to others. As a result, we are confirming our aspiration to remain the engine of electro-mobility and to become market leader in green logistics," says JÃ¼rgen Gerdes, board member for Post - eCommerce - Parcel at Deutsche Post DHL Group.|||
