If you want a safe investment then invest in deposits or bonds.

“Higher the risk, higher the return” that’s the first rule of investment.

I had Bitcoin worth approx $400 in Nov 2016, I took out original $400 + $50 in March 2017, I still have approx $583 there.

Bitcoin has given more than 170% return in last one year. So definitely a investment to consider.

But there are legal complications in some countries, Reserve Bank of India in recent announcement said “use Bitcoin on your own risk”. Bitcoin is legal in most of the countries in Europe and USA.

Future is unpredictable, so no one can tell you what will be the return.

If you want my suggestion, buy some BTC when price goes down (below $1000) and just wait, it won’t disappoint you.

Coinbase is the best place to buy bitcoins, sign up and buy BTC of more than $100, you’ll get extra $10.|||
