Facebook is down for Virgin Media users across the UK

VIRGIN MEDIA has confirmed that its broadband customers are now able to access Facebook after a DNS issue saw access to the social network restricted.

"We're aware of an intermittent issue that's affected some of our broadband customers accessing Facebook and Instagram, a Virgin Media spokesperson told INQ in a statement.

"We believe this was an issue with Facebook's servers, which we understand to be resolved.

"We're contacting Facebook to confirm our customers can now access these sites.

Virgin Media noted that the problems occurred when Virgin Media's DNS caches intermittently timed out when trying to connect to Facebook's shonky servers.

Pissed off procrastinators, likely those who were desperate to share baby photos or a picture of a sandwich, flocked to Twitter to moan about the downtime, which appears to have been affecting users all over the country since around 8pm on Tuesday evening. Facebook's Instagram and Messenger services were also affected.

Facebook has yet to comment, but we'll update this story if we hear more. µ|||
