An injury at the Apple campus is the best clue we have so far that Apple is working on AR glasses.

After an injury late last month, an incident report mistakenly found its way into the hands of hundreds of Apple reporters. This report found its way to Gizmodo earlier today. Titled “Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month,” the report contained new information about Apple’s rumored AR project.

There’s nothing concrete, but the report confirms that Apple is testing headsets designed to overlay a 3D image into your eye.

After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.

This follows another report from March 2, detailing the same sort of injury.

Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.

According to sources close to the matter, Apple may be testing both AR and VR headsets. While these don’t confirm the existence of either, it certainly sounds like something is in the works at Apple HQ.

If you know anything about this prototype, shoot me an email, or reach me on Telegram.
