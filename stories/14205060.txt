Create a strong password that's easy to regenerate from memory.

You'll need to setup NodeJS first.

First, setup "pass" by exporting environment variable to a word you're very likely to remember. Use the same word for every installation!

Second, put the "pass" command somewhere in your PATH e.g. your "bin" folder.

Third, run "pass" by writing a password phrase to the command "pass" like so:

Note that passwords are at least 30 characters long and include 2 special chars.

First you might set your environment variable to be "yellowBIRD123".

Then maybe for your Google account "john.doe@gmail.com" you choose the pass phrase "Gmail John Doe" - i.e. the service name followed by the person's name. At Facebook, maybe the pass phrase would be "Facebook John Doe" instead.

This would provide the following passwords:

To crack your password, a hacker would need to know both your value and your memorized formula for composing pass phrases. Obviously you should share neither of these with other people. They'd also need this "pass" program, so you might want to keep this a secret too.

I hope you find "pass" to be useful!|||
