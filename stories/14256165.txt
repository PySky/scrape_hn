This year, the people of North Carolina have a chance to guarantee their right to repair their equipment—like tractors, appliances, digital equipment, and even cell phones.

It’s yours. You own it. You shouldn’t have to beg the manufacturer for permission to fix it when it breaks. North Carolina’s Fair Repair Act, H. 663, is simple. It requires manufacturers to provide owners and independent repair businesses with access to service information, diagnostic tools, and affordable replacement parts. So you can fix the stuff you own quickly—and get back on with your life.

But manufacturers like John Deere and Apple don’t like that idea. When your tractor breaks or your cell phone stops working, they want to be the only people who can fix it. And they get to set whatever prices they want for parts and service.

It’s time to fight for your right to repair and defend local repair jobs—the corner mom-and-pop repair shops that keep getting squeezed out. Find out who represents you in the North Carolina state legislature. Tell them you support the Fair Repair Act, H. 663. Tell them that you believe repair should be fair, affordable, and accessible. Stand up for the right to repair in North Carolina.|||
