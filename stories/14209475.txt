TypeScript gives you compile-time type safety for your JavaScript code. External data which you get through, for example, XHR calls is only checkable at runtime. allows you to handle runtime checks in one place using an easy to use API.

{ userId ; id ; title ; completed ; } This is new: Define a Todo Parser with spicery: todos < > ({ userId: ( , , ), id: ( , , ), title: ( , , ), completed: ( , , ) }); Define another Parser for an Array containing Todos using spicery array parser: jsonplaceholderTodos ( ); . ( ) . ( ( )( . )) . ( . ( ))

For further examples refer to the directory. To execute them locally, clone this repository and run following commands on your command line of choice:

Though the first command is only used to install any module dependencies once

The branch contains the latest stable release. Development efforts are integrated with the branch first. Changes get then merged into as soon as a new release should be published.
