Transactions per hour rates calculated on the basis of rolling 60 minute windows. The Mempool is where transactions wait to be mined into the permanent blockchain record of transactions. The network hashrate is a measure of the processing power that is used to verify Monero transactions. The CPU core equivalent number is based on the average CPU core being able to calculate 30 hashes per second. Monero transactions are mined into 'blocks'. A new block is mined on average every 2 minutes. Block 'height' simply means the sequential number assigned to the most recent block mined, starting from 0 when Monero was first launched. Transactions per hour stats are updated after each Monero block is mined (every 2 minutes).
