Cloudera shares bounced 20.7 percent in their public debut on Friday.

The stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker "CLDR." Shares rose to $18 a share as the stock opened around 10.:45 a.m. ET, and closed at $18.10 a share.

The company priced its IPO at $15 a share, above the expected range of $12 to $14 a share. But it's significantly less than the $30.92 a share that Intel paid for the stock in 2014, according to regulatory documents.

Chief executive Tom Reilly told CNBC that because Intel is working with Cloudera to design data analytics software and hardware that works together, the deal with Intel was structured differently in the private market.|||
