Nigeria's digital economy is expected to create over 3 million jobs and add $88 billion to the country's economy in ten years. This was revealed in Geneva, Switzerland where the government ministers from developing countries including Nigeria, Mexico, Kenya, Argentina, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Uruguay, Chile, Costa Rica and Pakistan resolved to put forward a policy agenda to bridge the digital divide as well as provide development solutions in the long term,

The ministers met under the auspices of Friends of E-Commerce for Development (FED) in Geneva, Switzerland on 25 April 2017.

Nigeria's Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, who led the Nigerian delegation to Geneva, explained that the Ministry is already developing the “Smart Nigeria Digital Economy Project”.

“The Smart Nigeria Digital Economy Project is Nigeria’s response to an area of intense economic and technological activity by Nigerian youths, where there is a growing pool of talent”, Enelamah said.

“It is a sector of the economy where the private sector already has ownership. The role of government would therefore be to ensure a sound pro-competitive regulatory environment and hardware infrastructure to foster rapid growth of this area,” he added.

Nigeria has approximately 150 million active mobile phone users with 60% plus being reported to be connected to the Internet.

The FED is a diverse, non-negotiating, group of WTO Members and UN Member States at different levels of development, with an understanding of the impact of E-Commerce and its ability to create sustainable economic opportunities for all.|||
