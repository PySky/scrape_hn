The current version of the popular minimap package seems to have decided to add kite ads. An issue has already been opened on GitHub: https://github.com/atom-minimap/minimap/issues/588

The ads are also implemented badly such that toggling the minimap does not hide them and any further toggling just duplicates the ads. The developer that added the ads also seems to be associated with the kite project himself (https://kite.com/aboutus).

Is this how we should envision open source?|||
