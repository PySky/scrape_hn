IBM is committed to open source programming and tooling. We are now releasing our core set of Bluemix Mobile Services SDKs onto Github. We’re starting with Android, to be followed by Swift and Cordova. We’re inviting developers to use the SDKs to integrate with our suite of Bluemix Mobile Services.

Whether you’re focused on client-side, server-side, or both, your job is about to get easier. You’ll be able to access Push, Cloudant, Advanced Mobile Access, and other services. Our set of client-side SDKs lets you target iOS, Android, Cordova, and Windows; server-side SDKs give you the edge in Node.js and Liberty server. Whatever space you work in, IBM Bluemix Mobile Services SDKs are the right tools for you. 

 



When you use one of the Bluemix Mobile Services SDKs, you’re taking advantage of a ready-made set of tools that lets you quickly integrate with our mobile services. But if you really want to ramp up your skills AND your productivity, why not contribute improvements and additions to the SDKs themselves. That’s why we’re open — we want to show you what we’ve got and then see what you want to add. 



You know those mind-numbing repetitive programming tasks you’re constantly having to revisit? That code you keep having to write from scratch? The code and tools you wish you had in place so you can get down to the fun stuff? We’ve got you covered. You’ll save time, frustration, and yes, costs.

You’ll save time, frustration, and yes, costs. And your development team will think you understand them. And that’s a good thing.|||
