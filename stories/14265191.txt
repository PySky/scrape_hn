Soylent launched in 2013 with more than $3 million from the largest crowdfunded food project in history. The Company has maintained consistent, strong sales growth. In the first quarter of 2017, net revenue nearly doubled over the same quarter in the prior year. Soylent’s suite of products has grown beyond its original Powder (now on version 1.8), to ready-to-drink meals in 2015, flavor expansions, and its debut on Amazon Launchpad last year.
