We're really excited about what we've put together for the Analyze Boston site, and are kicking off this challenge to demonstrate the potential of open data to deliver new insights and help to make life better for everyone who lives and works in Boston. As part of the city's data community, we're looking for you to bring your unique skills and perspectives to our data. We've outlined five different tracks for the challenge, each corresponding to a different area where your work can have a real-world impact, and we're hoping the projects that come from them will be a lot of fun to work on as well.

You can read more about those challenge tracks below, along with other details about how you can participate. We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with!|||
