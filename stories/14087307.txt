Something quick and tactical: Put your phone away in a drawer while you are working (or want to gsd). Not sure why I started doing this, but it’s noticeably increased my productivity.

The difference between this and keeping your phone in your pocket, placing it face down, turning on “Do Not Disturb”, etc. is that you HAVE to be intentional about your phone use. You can’t unconsciously grab it and sneak in Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/Snapchat/Tinder scrolling and swiping.

If you don’t have a desk drawer handy, zip it into a bag or jacket pocket that you take off. Multi-tasking and context switching is slowly killing us so you might as well try.

Bonus idea: set up a phone “parking lot” at your office space or home. Use an egg carton, old six pack or paper box. Everyone that wants to participate “parks” their phone inside, the rest is self-explanatory.
