Access it at http://localhost:8080, and enter with your user and password. If your user is in the or group it will have admin access, and can add other users and disable PAM access.

If you plan to develop Serverboards core itself, first compile it once to ensure you have all the required dependencies:

And then you may run it executing these commands in two different terminals:

Now you can connect to the backend at http://localhost:8080 or at the running webpack server at http://localhost:3000 .

If you connect to the webpack server it is necessary to force the backend URL so that the Websocket can connect. Open the developer console at the browser (F12 or Crtl+Shift+C), and write:

Alternatively you can create the release with and run it as .

To devlop new plugins create a directory or link to your source at $SERVERBOARDS_PATH/plugins, which by default is on installed systems at . If you use the development version, it would be at .

Plugin manifest is normally reloaded automatically upon changes, and commands at command restart. If it is necessary to force a command execution, you can restart full Serverboards ( or restart backend process).|||
