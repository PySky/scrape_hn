The Rebel’s Ezra Levant posted the following tweet, pointing out that Google creates doodles for everything, “no matter how obscure or bizarre” (more on this later).

Subsequently, a number of users joined in the criticism.

“But they will be all over Ramadan like a rash,” wrote @TitanicQueen. “Just watch for that one Ezra.”

“Shame,” wrote @PlimouthMA. “Where’s the doodle celebrating Easter? Is EVERYTHING under the sun EXCEPT Christianity to be celebrated?”

“@Google clearly isn’t a great fan of Christians and Christianity,” wrote @SevenGreenLions.

As Newsbusters reports, the ‘controversy’ has popped up in previous years too. Last year, the company actually addressed the backlash.

“Thank you everyone for your feedback,” wrote a Google employee named AJ on the company’s feedback board. “We enjoy celebrating holidays at Google but, as you may imagine, it can be difficult for us to choose which events to highlight on our site each year.”|||
