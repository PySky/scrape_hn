The entrance exam for All Souls College at Oxford University has been called the world's hardest test.

That's because it's nearly impossible to revise for. The questions are abstract and there are no right or wrong answers.

Only a twentieth of the Oxford graduates who take the test are invited to continue the process.

The prize is a 7-year fellowship at Oxford University, which typically goes to two students each year.



The test comes up in September, so a new batch of applicants have just run the gauntlet.
