Ever had a nasty merge conflict in your code?

Most major version control systems like Git allow to enable a conflict style, where you can see both conflicting versions as well as their common base version. This is called diff3.

But even then, it can be quite tedious to find out, what exactly was changed in the two conflicting commits. Usually, one ends up comparing the three versions manually. This tool takes a diff3-style conflict as input and outputs the two underlying conflicting diffs. Hopefully, this solves a few headaches for you.|||

Format code conflicts by displaying the underlying diffs separately.
