Linux/Shishiga is a binary packed with UPX 3.91 (Ultimate Packer for Executables), but the UPX tool will have trouble unpacking these binaries because Shishiga adds data at the end of the packed file.

After unpacking, we see that it’s statically linked with the Lua runtime library and stripped of all symbols.

Once executed, the binary will initialize the Lua module with the following methods:

The method will return the archive blob as we will explain later. Then hardcoded Lua code ( ) is executed via the and functions. The Lua code is quite straightforward, but here is a quick walkthrough of the source code without any modifications on our part.

There is an exhaustive list of all Lua scripts found in the IoCs section. Most of them have self-explanatory filenames, but here is a brief summary of some of them.

The script has a message banner that grabs your attention, if you speak Russian:

It seems that the malware author was inspired by E.Letov and his album Everything goes according to plan – see the last verse of the title song.

Over the past few weeks, we observed some minor changes like parts of some modules being rewritten, addition of testing modules, removal of redundant files, but nothing especially noteworthy.

While the main binary is named , we also managed to retrieve binaries with the following name  – a simple backdoor that listens on (all IPv4 addresses) port . One of the small changes was in the name of this backdoor binary – it changed from to .|||

The usage of the BitTorrent protocol and Lua modules separates Linux/Shishiga from other types of malware, according to analysis by ESET.
