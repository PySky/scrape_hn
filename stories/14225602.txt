The Turkey Blocks monitoring network has verified restrictions affecting the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia in Turkey. A block affecting all language editions of the website detected at 8:00AM local time Saturday 29 April. The loss of availability is consistent with internet filters used to censor content in the country.

Certain subdomains remained partially available on ISP TTNet at the time of writing, while the restriction appears to by fully implemented on Uydunet, Turkcell and other fixed line and mobile service providers.

SSL errors are issued for https requests, indicating failing to connect to the authentic servers, while the unencrypted addresses now return an nginx http 404 error indicative of filtering.

All language editions of the site are affected and the restriction is in place with multiple service providers.

The BTK/ICTA portal reports that the site has been blocked under a provisional administrative order:

An administrative blocking order is usually expected to precede a full court blocking order in subsequent days.

Update: A formal judgement has been issued in approval of the administrative measure, indicating that a permanent restriction is now in place.
