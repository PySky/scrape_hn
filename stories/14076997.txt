EU businesses selling digital services have to charge consumers local VAT. For example: Say your company is German but your customer lives in Sweden. Then you need to charge the Swedish rate (25%), not the German one (19%). You owe the collected tax to Sweden.

MOSS stands for "Mini One Stop Shop". Instead of requiring you to file a tax report in Sweden, MOSS lets you declare and pay the tax in your home country. The service automatically distributes the proceeds to the various EU member states.|||
