For a long time I've procrastinated to learn how to properly configure HTTPS. Turns out it is super easy. This is my simple step by step guide.

First, make sure that your nginx config can serve files from - it should work by default.

Then install certbot - it is a script that will place some files into your , and then use them to verify that you have the ssh access to the server, which proves that you are the domain owner.

Now you can use this script to generate your certificates:

This is a file that you're going to use to prove people that you're all good and not an evil hacker.

You also want to run a script that generates something called "Diffie-Hellman Group" - some sort of fancy security thingy that makes your SSL more secure.

which you will serve along with SSL certificate.

Now you want to create two nginx configuration snippets - bits of config that will properly configure nginx and tell it where to find your certificates.

First create a file , with this content:

It will tell nginx where your certificates are.

Now you want nginx to take all the requests coming to your website, and redirect them to https with properly configured SSL.

Just create or modify the file to look like this:

The first block of code will redirect all the http traffic to https, and the second will load the snippets you've created to configure ssl and serve the certificates.

Now all you need to do is restart nginx:

and your site will be served over https!|||
