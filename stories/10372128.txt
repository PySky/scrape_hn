Artist George Redhawk has put together a series of stunning GIFs, perfectly looped and beautifully haunting. Even more incredible is that Redhawk is legally blind.

"With the use of visual aides and computer softwares that aide the visually impaired, [Redhawk] began to explore the realm of photo manipulation with a desire to show the world as he see it from his damaged sight," his biography says.

His numerous works have received more than six million views online, he said. See his full collection of more than a thousand images on his website.
