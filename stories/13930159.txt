PEMF Therapy for Alzheimer’s disease research proves PEMF therapy has beneficial effects upon Alzheimer’s disease and the underlying causes of neurophysiological abnormalities.

The neurological system (entire body) operates via electric and electromagnetic signals. Does it not make sense to address neurological disease states such as Alzheimer’s from an electrophysiological or electrochemical rather than from a chemical based point of view? Researchers continue to declare ‘YEARS’ before meaningful rTMS treatment for Alzheimer’s sufferers when several researchers already proved the benefit of Alzheimer’s disease sufferers. We believe minute stimulation during sleep every night is superior to huge amounts of stimulation over short course of days or weeks as in these studies below.

50 years of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy research suggests that some sort type of electrophysiological deficit exists in neurological disease states and that it should be addressed via same electrophysiological channel.
