You sit in your car, listening to a light rain ping quietly down on the hood. You’ve just finished your fourth trip of the night, and you sit back and relax. Not for long though, it’s a busy night and you accept another pickup request close by. As navigation begins, you check your mirrors, shift into drive, and pull out onto the road towards a new destination. You work your way across a few lanes of heavy traffic to make that first left coming up. After more lights and turns, you arrive at a busy pickup point and look for a safe space to pull over. Out of the crowd on the sidewalk, a person waves and heads your way.

You’re about to find out where you’re going next.

On the driver team at Uber, one of our jobs is to take the pressure off of drivers, so that they can focus on smooth and stress-free rides for everybody. We want to make sure that drivers have the best features possible directly in-app, and one of the most important features is a navigation system. So we started with a basic question:

If you’re browsing for a new restaurant for lunch, or trying to find a lecture hall on a college campus, you’ll have different mapping needs than if you’re in the mountains on a two-day hike. And, if you’re commuting to work on a familiar daily route, or driving to a friend’s birthday party, your navigation needs are different from people driving with Uber. Why are one-size-fits-all digital maps not a good fit for Uber?

Unlike traditional navigation apps, Uber Navigation has to help its users answer the question “What’s next?”
