What will we build? Why will we build it and How will we build it?

What: We will build a website and simple blog using React JS.

Why: Because although its easy to build anything using React JS, When it comes down to building a website it's difficult., Because websites needs to focus on SEO along with other things and If we're doing everything static this gets complicated fast. (If you're using server then this wont be much of a problem).

How: We will make use of Code Splitting and load only the required scripts, We will generate (pre-rendered) HTML page for every route in our website, This will help us serve content with SEO tags.

Please Note: Google can index Javascript/SPAs., But this is not the same for every search engine, And even if they can index our SPAs, We wont be able to make use of Rich Snippets, Twitter Cards or Facebook Open Graph without serving our content pre-rendered. I tried this website (without pre-rendering) and it didnt work.|||

In this tutorial series we will learn to build a static website using React JS, Complete with Search Engine Optimization, Code Splitting, Pre-rendering and gzipping. We will also handle form Submission using a Serverless API and later publish our website.
