The Natural Gas Reports is the re-imagined Natural Gas Data & Map Book and it has been integrated as the latest component of the GeoWeb Portal, our web-based mapping application. With live, dynamic and interactive features and data, the Natural Gas Reports combines the practicality and ease of use of the printed book with the power of nearly 50 million data records on interstate natural gas pipelines and facilities across the United States.

The Natural Gas Reports allows users to access up to date and historical daily gas flow and capacity information, dating back to 2008, for more than 20,000 interconnections. For those familiar with our book, all the charts and pipeline information are still present in the Natural Gas Reports, with the added benefit of real-time reporting. Users of this application will now be able to create their own charts dynamically relying on current data and not static end of year summaries.|||
