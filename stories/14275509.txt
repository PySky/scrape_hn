SiFive unveiled their Freedom U500 and E500 open source RISC-V SoCs last year, and a little layer launched HiFive1 Arduino compatible development board based on SiFive Freedom E310 processor. The company has now launched their non-open source Coreplex IP also based on RISC-V ISA with the 32-bit E31 Coreplex and 64-bit E51 Coreplex, and explained details about pricing.

Some of the key features of the processors are listed below:

If you want to manufacture an ARM processor, you first need to buy a license before accessing any information, and once you’re shipping your chips, you’ll pay royalties for each SoC sold with one or more ARM cores. SiFive business model is different. First, it’s free to try Coreplex IP on FPGA boards such as Digilent Arty, or evaluate RTL code in your own environment, so you don’t need to commit to any large investment before knowing whether you’ll go ahead with the cores. SiFive Coreplex IP is also royalty-free so how much you pay does not depend on how many chips you sell, and the way they make money is through a one-time license that costs $275,000 and up for E31 Coreplex, and $595,000 and up for E51 Coreplex with the exact price depending on options.
