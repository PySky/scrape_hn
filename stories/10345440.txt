App installed with no problems- but the notification center doesnâ€™t open properly now. Clicking on the notification icon in the top menu bar, it slides in and out too fast to see anything. It also just randomly closes, occasionally. I added a keyboard shortcut to open the notification center instead, until the developer fixes this. I would also like the app to remain toggled open- currently when you open the Notification Center, the app only shows the title of the account, the users for today, the sessions for today, the current users, and an arrow to access detailed info about the account. Which is great- but if I toggle the content open, I want it to remain open the next time I open the center, rather than have to click again. Could be a really decent and helpful widget as soon as these bugs are worked out.|||
