When you are developing a object model or a validator for CloudFormation templates, you can surely appreciate a computer-readable specification of the properties and return values for all CloudFormation resources.

We proudly present a YAML version of the CloudFormation Resource Types Reference.

We have put much effort in trying to parse the documentation as good as possible but please keep in mind that the documentation itself may not be entirely free of errors and inconsistencies.

All content of the YAML file has copyright by Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates, and was published under the terms that can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/terms/|||
