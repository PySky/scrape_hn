vizceral is a component for displaying traffic data on a webgl canvas. If a graph of nodes and edges with data about traffic volume is provided, it will render a traffic graph animating the connection volume between nodes.

This component can take multiple traffic graphs and will generate a 'global' graph showing all incoming traffic into each of the 'regions', with support for cross-region traffic.

There are three levels of information, global, regional, and service-level, with clicking or double-clicking on a node bringing you one level deeper.

See the wiki for full documentation.

To see your changes to locally, you'll need to link the package with bower:

Current development focuses on most recent version of Chrome. Minor sanity checking for the latest versions of Safari and Firefox.|||
