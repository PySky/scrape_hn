A content industry dream is to order infringing content to be taken down and for it to remain down permanently, no matter what. That's currently outside the scope of the DMCA, but some anti-piracy outfits are already trying their luck by suggesting that content should never reappear. Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad if they targeted the right stuff in the first place.
