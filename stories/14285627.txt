In August 2011, a group of watch enthusiasts started their journey into horology following an online tutorial. The goal of this project is to assist the watch hobbyist in disassembly and assembly of a Seiko 7S26 mechanism. 



 Due to a number of requests, we have now set up a dedicated mailing list for the Seiko DIY course participants. The mailing list will serve to allow better communication between 'students' and allow the rest to follow the progress of our project. The group is not moderated so please focus posts on topics related to the DIY project: assembly tips, general observations, help requests, tools and parts exchange, project photos and DIY comments.
