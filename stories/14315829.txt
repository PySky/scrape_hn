Laravel DataTables adds server-side processing capabilities for a table powered by jQuery DataTables to a Laravel application. There is official site with detailed documentation and good examples. However I couldn’t find an example of using orthogonal data for sortable and searchable fields containing timestamps.

There is an example of using DateTime/Carbon object however this example shows date and time in format which is sortable but most often you would want to use date/time format suitable for your country or a maybe human-readable format, such as .

jQuery DataTables uses the term “orthogonal data” to describe a field having multiple values for different operations, such as sorting, filtering or display. In our case, our data field can have one value for display such as and another value that would be used for ordering.

Response for this data in JSON format may look as shown below:

To produce data in multiple formats you need to use editColumn method and return associative array consisting of formats for display ( ) and sorting ( ). Optionally you may want to use filterColumn method to allow searching in the same format that is used for display ( ).

On the front-end you need to use columns.render option and specify data property for each operation.|||
