TL;DR: I’m open-sourcing a continuous deployment pipeline built for AWS to automate the process of creating and deploying AWS Lambda functions and related infrastructure.

Because of my tinkering with Alexa, I wanted to have an automated way of deploying a new version of a Lambda function just via . Doing it manually is cumbersome. As of late, AWS offers all the tools necessary to do so. Their Code* family of services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild & CodePipeline) are the perfect building blocks to set up this process.

Furthermore, I also wanted to automate the necessary infrastructure and treat it as code. That’s where CloudFormation comes in. I didn’t have any prior knowledge of CloudFormation, so it was a great learning experience. I used this excellent template as a start point and I want to thank to the guys over at Cloudonaut for publishing it. Still, it took me a lot of time to grasp all the concepts of CFN and I went through a lot of trial-and-error to figure out how everything ties in together.

In the end, I’m very happy with the result. This initial version is quite basic, but it works well. What makes it cool is that the pipeline is self-referencing, so any changes you make to it get automatically applied. You can read the details about how it works in the README.

I will be expanding its functionality, feel free to star the repo on GitHub and follow along.|||
