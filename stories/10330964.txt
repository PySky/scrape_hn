Using data from the International Monetary Fund, the folks at the cost information website Howmuch.net created an evolving Voronoi diagram that shows how the gross domestic product (GDP) of the world's largest countries have changed from 1980 to 2015.

In the video, the size of the countries will expand and contract relative to how their economy has changed in terms of nominal GDP.

Note: The area labeled "other" represents countries with a combined GDP that has been consistently lower than 11.5% of the global economy over the last 35 years.

Based on theÂ data, Howmuch.net came to some conclusions about the global economy. Namely, nearly every region in the world has experienced a period of economic expansion and a period of recession over the last 35 years.

It also shows how the global economy produces a wave effect. For instance, the US economic recession from 2007 to 2009 caused the European economy to shrink and the Asian economy to expand.

The biggest change in the global economy over the last 35 years has been the transfer of economic power from Europe to Asia. Within Asia, Japan has ceded economic dominance to China over the last 35 years.

The economies of North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania have remained relatively stable over that period. The United States still has the world's largest economy, with 22.5% of the world's GDP.|||
