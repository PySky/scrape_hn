Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

Or install it yourself as:

First of all you need to decide a format for your commit messages e.g. #Feature [Dev1/Dev2] Your commit message

You can choose any format as long as you are able to extract dev names from the message using a regex. Once you have decided on the commit message format, create a pairing_matrix.yml file.

This regex is used to extract dev names from the commit message. You can verify your regex in irb console using the below command. If your regex is correct it will return an array of dev names.

If you want to use private github repos for matrix, then create a github_access_token and give it the repo read permission. Here is how you can create this token: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

List your repos which you want to use for matrix. If you have your repos inside organization then follow the format else just mention .

Now after installing the pairing matrix gem, simply run the command in the repo where you have file. This command will start a web server. Then hit the url in the browser.

The above config will fetch data directly from your local repositories.|||
