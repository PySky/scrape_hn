This is a very simple and lightweight x86 virtual machine which can load and run the assembly code from ida pro directly.

We get one assemble code from ida pro first and this code will call the libc api:

And we call it in c language first.

Nextly, we attempt to load this asm code using our x86 virtual machine.

( value) { s_code_sub_hello[] = { }; machine = (); (machine) { lock = (machine); (lock); stack = (machine); proc = ( (machine), s_code_sub_hello, (s_code_sub_hello)); (proc) { (machine, , vm86_demo_proc_func_printf); (stack, value); (proc); (stack, tb_null); ( , value); } (lock); } } ( argc, ** argv) { (0x31415926); }

The script files: and in the project directory (idc) can help us to export the given assembly function and data from the ida pro.|||
