The embedded world is large but, lately, we've noticed a few micro communities popping up. These groups embody subsets of individuals who share common interests in the embedded sphere.

One community we've joined is Firmware.DOT.world, started by Bob Scaccia, President and CEO at USA Firmware, LLC.

It's well-organized and welcoming to its 200+ members, who come from numerous industries, hold various roles and live in different countries, The site includes fresh daily content posted by members, a post upvote/downvote system and a discussion area.

This community is friendly and there's no "shaming" on posts, likely due to the post voting system (perhaps LinkedIn and other larger communities should consider this convention...)

We hope you'll check it out and join.|||
