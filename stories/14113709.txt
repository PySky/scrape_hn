Here we can see a screenshot of my Facebook page as recently shown.

As you can see here, it really is Facebook, even with the secure "https" connection. You can see their statement about how concerned they are with fake news.

But then look over at the "Sponsored" section.

Yes, this is Facebook showing you things that people have paid to have shown. And yes, the item shown here is fake.

So Facebook is really concerned about fake news.

Until you pay them to show it. Then their objections seem to evaporate ...|||
