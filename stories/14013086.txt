The xwallpaper utility allows you to set image files as your X wallpaper. JPEG, PNG, and XPM file formats are supported, all of them being configurable and therefore no fixed dependencies.

The wallpaper is also advertised to programs which support semi-transparent backgrounds.

The aim of this project is to create a minimalistic wallpaper utility which focuses on the most common use cases.

It directly depends on libraries which are used by X, like libxcb, and therefore has no further hard dependencies on projects which are not already on your system due to having a basic X environment.

The last but not least focus of this project is to write a secure wallpaper utility, supporting very tight sandboxing mechanisms. A careful approach right from the start made this especially easy.

The build environment is based on autotools just like other X components. Building and installing is as simple as:

To support all file formats, your system needs libjpeg, libpng, and libXpm. If one of the libraries is not found, the specific file format will not be supported. Also, if you compile for OpenBSD, the system call pledge is automatically used.
