One question that arises frequently on alt.sysadmin.recovery is "Is there any operating system that doesn't suck?"

Of course, it's usually phrased as "AAAAAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!! Aren't there any operating systems that don't suck?!?!?!"

The answer, as we all know, is no. All operating systems suck. They suck, blow, bite, chomp, chew, spit, dribble, drool, blubber, blabber, and puke. Every last one of 'em sucks in some way or other. They are designed for maximal sysadmin discomfort by festering syphillitic marketroids. Not one does not suck.

In case you think otherwise, I have compiled the Canonical List of Operating Systems That Suck.
