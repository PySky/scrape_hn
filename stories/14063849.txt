David Aronchick (Senior Product Manager for Google Container Engine and Kubernetes at Google) joined us at Zalando Tech's Headquarters in Berlin on 27 March to chat about how the adoption of Kubernetes has led to an industry revolution in shipping distributed software quickly, reliably and at scale. During his talk, we looked at new features in Kubernetes 1.6, including cross cluster federation improvements, sophisticated scheduling, and cloud storage options.



Zalando Tech's very own Henning Jacobs then followed by briefly covering our learnings while running Kubernetes on AWS in production, including cluster provisioning, AWS integration, Ingress, cluster autoscaling, OAuth/IAM and operations/monitoring.|||
