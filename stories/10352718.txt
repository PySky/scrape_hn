If you enjoy watching The Daily Show like me, then you were probably curious to watch the first episode last Monday with the new host, Trevor Noah.

In the episode, Trevor’s first guest is Kevin Hart, a fellow comedian.

At 2:27 in the clip, Trevor is amazed at Kevin’s success but mentions that he was always concerned about Kevin’s height…

He mentions how someone once told him, “Man, you’re a lot smaller than I thought you was.”

His response at 2:55, Trevor asks Kevin, “Comic to comic, you are now performing in front of 53,000 people. How do you tell a joke in a crowd that big?”

Kevin’s response again is something we can all learn from.

Kevin goes on to talk about the importance of storytelling, how that causes people to relate to him, and then it doesn’t matter if he’s talking to 53 people, 5,000 people, or 53,000 people.

The takeaway from this is that as humans, we all create perceptions of others based on our own cultural and social filters. It could be about one’s physical size or something else, but the most important thing is knowing that we have a message to share and an audience ready to hear it. When we allow ourselves to tell our story with passion and openness, we’re able to create that “intimate” experience with the audience and let them into our world.

If we hold back by giving into others’ perceptions of us, then we lose out on the opportunity to share and connect.
