I love to write about face recognition, image recognition and all the other cool things you can build with machine learning. Whenever possible, I try to include code examples or even write libraries/APIs to make it as easy as possible for a developer to play around with these fun technologies.

But the number one question I get asked is “How in the world do I get all these open source libraries installed and working on my computer?”

If you aren’t a long-time Linux user, it can be really hard to figure out how to get a system fully configured with all the required machine learning libraries and tools like TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, OpenCV, and dlib. The majority of the issues that get filed on my own open source projects are about how to install these tools. A lot of people get stuck while installing everything and give up before ever getting to play around with any code. That’s a shame!|||
