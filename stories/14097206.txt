An extandable adapter which provides swipe to delete on your row item.

In the app folder you will find a working example of the library

You need to do 3 things to make the library works:

Pay attention to the Factory class, you need to return an instance of your ViewHolder (Factory pattern)

You can use "this" as third parameter in the Adapter or you can directly pass in an implementation of the Listener, both ways you will implement the interface to handle item delete

Your item layout container must be a Relative Layout, otherwise the Holder will throw you a NotSupportedException
