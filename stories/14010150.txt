We started with a simple idea; what could we achieve if we took 50 students and early stage software development professionals and brought them to Jamaica to work on real world projects that real Caribbean companies and Governments needed solved?

We decided the best way to go about this was to invite as many students and early stage professionals as possible to Jamaica. They would pay for their air fare and we would cover their accommodation, pair that with a living stipend in Jamaica and you have the makings of a great time in Jamaica sharpening the skills of possibly the greatest Entrepreneurs and Developers of tomorrow.

What we are doing has never been done and people do ask us " What's In it for you?!?!?" the truth is getting the people to Jamaica exposing them to our culture and continuing to bolster the Caribbean Start-Up Economy is value in itself, so why not help us fulfill our mission? At the very least you'll get a really cool vacation out of it|||
