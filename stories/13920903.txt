Outage 3-29-2017 Hey everyone - sorry for the outage there, there was a good old fashioned hardware failure. Also note: backups, a good idea!

The Nifty Assignments session at the annual SIGCSE meeting is all about gathering and distributing great assignment ideas and their materials. For each assignment, the web pages linked below describe the assignment and provides materials -- handouts, starter code, and so on.

See the info page for ideas about what makes a nifty assignment and how to apply for the Nifty session. Applications are due a few days before the regular SIGCSE deadline. Please email any suggestions or comments to Nick Parlante @ cs.stanford.edu with "nifty" in the subject. Nick's Home|||
