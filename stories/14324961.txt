Dead Giant Squid Washes Up on Seram Island in Maluku

Jakarta. The remains of a giant squid washed up on the shores of Seram Island in Maluku province earlier this week.

According to a statement Beritasatu.com received on Wednesday (10/05), a resident, identified as Asrul Tuanakota (37), discovered the 15-meter-long squid on Tuesday evening.

In the darkness, Asrul initially mistook the giant sea creature for a stranded boat.

The unusual finding attracted scores of residents to Hulung Beach at Iha village in West Seram district. The reason for the giant squid washing up on the shore is still unknown, but it is believed to have been dead for at least three days before it was found. Residents have meanwhile asked the government to help them remove the remains of the squid as it already started to decay.
