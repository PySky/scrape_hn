8 very good reasons why square concrete stakes are better than round concrete stakes. A good video to send to your cavemen friends who are still using round stakes!



I realize I screwed up and made the music too loud. Sorry bout that.



I am very new to YouTube, and have a lot to learn. Especially related to video editing, how to use music, and how all of this works. My son is helping, but it is new territory for both of us. I appreciate your support and encouragement as we try to figure it out. 



All these videos are for entertainment and inspiration purposes only. The tools and techniques I use are dangerous, and I do not recommend you attempt unless you are a trained professional.
