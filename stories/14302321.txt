Hi folks, this is the second article of a series that I am working in to show how to make simple, but beautiful, micro interaction. You can see the first one here. The complete code of this tutorial can be found here:

Interactions between views take some time to get good, but those are the things that make a user fall in love with your product. There is a quote about the price of design that I really like:
