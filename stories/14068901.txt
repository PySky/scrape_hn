The CA/Browser Forum has voted to mandate that CAs must start checking CAA records to control certificate issuance (to verify what CAs are allowed to issue certificates for a domain) by September 8th, 2017.

Full language of the ballot is here.

For domain holders, not using CAA records implicitly allows any registrar to issue certificates for your domain (as long as their registration requirements are met).

See https://sslmate.com/labs/caa/ for latest status of which CAs support CAA records. That page also has an introduction to CAA records, and a CAA record generator.|||
