We are thrilled to announce that the Workload Intensive Cloud Servers are now available in Amsterdam. We're also officially ending the preview phase and entering General Availability on this server range.

With up to 120GB of RAM and 12 Xeon cores, you can now run all your memory and compute intensive workloads directly on Scaleway. The 15GB version is available for only â‚¬24.99/mo with 6 cores: 



These new servers are the most powerful in our lineup thanks to their Intel Xeon SoCs and DDR4 memory.

The Workload Intensive servers are available with the same pricing as during the preview, making these servers the most competitive Xeon based cloud servers on earth.

Last week, we increased the AMS1 network backbone capacity to support the new Workload Intensive Servers. After an upgrade of our core routers, we've added 200gb/s of network capacity: 100gb/s to AMX-IX and 100gb/s with Level3. We now have a total capacity of 800Gb/s in AMS1 allowing us to deliver a robust and reliable local connectivity.

To start playing with our new servers, you can easily launch a server from the server creation page and have it ready in less than a minute.

You can also use the Scaleway CLI to start your server directly from your terminal:

As always, you can automate the deployment of your new servers using the API or any Scaleway compatible projet.

If you need more servers than your account limits currently allows, simply open a support ticket, our support team will take care of increasing your server quota.
