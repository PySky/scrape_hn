Of course, I’ve still not figured out everything. But similar to Netflix’s Sophia from the Girlboss series , I’m sure things can only keep going up.

To some certain extent, I’m laughing at the fears I had prior to making this decision. At that time, thinking how would I be able to support myself with all the expenses. Meanwhile, knowing there’s no going back.

Frankly, I didn’t have any idea of what’s going to happen after deciding to pursue new challenges. Yet, I’ve enjoyed every bit of the ride up to this point. Especially all the opportunities that have come to me.

Thank god that I keep a calendar, otherwise who’d know…

For sure, I’ve missed something, but that should sum most of it up.

It seems like (almost) every company is currently looking for marketing specialists. Meanwhile, a lot of early stage companies are also struggling with everything related to fundraising. Meaning, it’s almost impossible not to find things to do.

However, I’ve decided not to sell my soul to anyone at this moment. Rather see if it’s possible to life off from travelling. There’s simply too many places I’ve yet to visit.

Thus, I’m in talks with couple of companies on various gigs. Such as helping some raise funds from the crowd and writing for others. All while travelling around, spreading the message of a third one. At times, giving a training or doing some one-on-one mentoring. Meanwhile sharing thoughts via my blog.

This plans seems to suit me the best for the next 3 to 6 months. Especially as it lets me work through plenty ideas of my own that I’m looking into.

Still, I’m constantly open to hear other offers. Either about starting something new or anything project based I could be of help with.|||

A quick overview of what I’ve been up to these past 30 days after moving on from Shipitwise.
