 This weekend, I managed to hang the terminal at the supermarket checkout. After entering my customer loyalty number, I had to enter my PIN and then press The Green Button.

I pressed it. Nothing. Several more presses of The Button That Was Green, and still nothing. The checkout cashier asked what message was showing, and I told him about The Green Button. He told me the terminal was frozen.

He didn’t seem too fazed by it. He made a phone call, carried on scanning my items, and directed me to a nearby till with a Working Green Button to actually make the payment.

I’ll never know the details of what actually happened with The Green Button, but it could have been a situation like one of the following:
