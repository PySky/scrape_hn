GNOME – nice desktop environment and very solid, elegant and easy to use. Every user has personal impressions and needs. Some monsters like a KDE is not a bad choice if you “need more”, but we just try to extend GNOME features with extensions. All extension tested on latest GNOME release – 3.18 (see review here). If I forgot some nice extension(s) – feel free to write about it in comments.

Time management – very important things for everyone. Pomodoro timer can help you to work faster: run timer -> do something -> stop and go to begin. Very helpful and must have tool.

Open Weather extension can help you to see current weather in one click. You can use GNOME Weather application, but this widget is more comfortable in my opinion. A personal API-key from Forecast.io is also needed.

Get more with standard Alt+Tab hotkey – opened window preview can help with navigation. This extension is also part of GNOME Classic Mode.

This extension add a category-based menu for all applications, also part of GNOME Classic Mode.

Superb extension – Move applications to specific workspaces everytime when it opened.

More compact view of applications in overview.

Add a new menu for fast navigation between mount points in the system. Extension you can find here.

Transfrom GNOME Dash (right on desktop) to dock(bottom). You can find it here.

This extension can help you to disable the screensaver and auto suspend in one click.

Very nice widget to monitoring your CPU.

Drop down terminal toggled by a keystroke (the key above tab by default) for advanced users. Highly recommended.

Easy access to control the multimedia players via top panel: Rhythmbox, Banshee, Clementine and others.

Numlock and Capslock access in one click.

Extended tool with many configuration options for screencasting.

Advanced configuration of the Activities Button and Panel

Turn off display with one click.

Note: some extensions don’t work in GNOME 3.18. Here is list of non-working, thanks to rand:|||
