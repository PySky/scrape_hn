* Ok, this one was from me ;-)

New gTLDs are understood in many different ways: the understanding from end users, and the understanding of domain name professionals is often not the same. As an actor of the ICANN new gTLD program, a true user of these new domains, and a consultant on these questions, find below a mix of things I heard, and things I believe are right about new gTLDs.I call a "Registrant", the person to own a domain name and who's had to pay interest in new gTLDs at some point: website owner, law firm, webmaster, IP department...|||

What is in Registrants mind when it comes to talking about new generic Top-Level Domains (new domain name extensions)?
