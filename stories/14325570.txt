You do not have to be a Linux pro to install it,You just have to be willing to understand the system and learn to have a system ready for your needs!

/Me > i am a long term Arch Linux user (Arch since 2007 / Linux since 1988) caus i like the way of minimalism/Kiss.

I love the stability and the rolling release state of time packagemanagement!

Antergos is in core a Arch Linux system, and using the Arch-Repos + extra a repository with Antergos packages.

Gnome > KDE > Cinnamon > Mate > XFCE > Openbox, or simple a base system, it will enable systemd-services, configure and design the Desktop with Icons and themes from NUMIX, and install the Desktop-Manager lightdm (grub and lightdm are themed by Antergos too).

pacman --needed -S - < antergos-17-3-gnome-packages-list.txt

Also a good option for backup system is to backup a packages list with all packages from your actual system, but be carefull with AUR packages, you will need to do two lists one for repository packages and one for AUR packages, otherwise it will be a messâ€¦
