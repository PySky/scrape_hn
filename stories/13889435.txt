Twitterrific for Mac was the very first Twitter client, released way back in 2007. Although we updated it regularly for many years, it eventually fell by the wayside when our focus shifted to the iOS version of Twitterrific.

But even after so many years, people still use and love the Mac version - including us! The time has come to reboot Twitterrific for Mac (codename: Phoenix).

Thanks to everyone who supported our Kickstarter to fund the project. You've exceeded our hopes and expectations, not only funding the project, but rising to the challenge so we can include some of our stretch goals.

Design and development is underway, so look for a new version of Twitterrific for Mac later this year!|||

Twitterrific is the friendly, award-winning Twitter client that's beautiful to look at, easy to use and full of elegant features.
