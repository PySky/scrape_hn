Baltimore County police say an armed robbery suspect in Parkville tried to flee in a vehicle operated by an Uber driver on Wednesday.

Dashawn Terrell Cochran, 23, faces charges including armed robbery, police said Friday. Cochran allegedly robbed a Royal Farms store in the 8200 block of Harford Road with a gun around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, fleeing with money from the cash registers.

Officers got a description of the suspect and used a K-9 unit to track his path, police said. Cochran was later seen getting into the back of silver Lexus. Police stopped the vehicle and detained three people inside.

The driver told police he was an Uber driver and had just picked up two passengers. Police say they released the driver and second passenger after determining they had nothing to do with the robbery.

Officers arrested Cochran within 30 minutes of the robbery call, according to the police department.

Cochran is being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center on $250,000 bail, court records show. No attorney is listed in the records.|||
