"We already thought about renting out our Alpine Chalet located in the "Berchtesgadener Land", as we are using it scarcely. But we always had reservations because of frequently changing guests and possible damages caused by them. About the concept of repos√©e we very much like that tenants are insured, and tenants are not changing every weekend or week, as the concept is based on seasonal rents!"|||

Share weekend houses, holiday apartments, or alpine chalets together, because most time of the month, they are unused. Owners earn money, tenants save money.
