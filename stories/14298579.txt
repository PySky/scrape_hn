In the previous post we learned some matplotlib plotting techniques.This is second part of matplotlib where we are going to work with some random dataset.This post will also cover basic different type of plotting you can produce in matplotlib.This type of plotting are mostly used to understand the type of data and produce useful insights.Learning and understanding matplotlib will take some longer learning time and some patience.While we are trying to learn by creating sample random dataset in dataframe and visualizaling different kind of plots.I have come to appreciate matplotlib because it is extremely powerful. The library allows you to create almost any visualization you could imagine. Additionally, there is a rich ecosystem of python tools built around it and many of the more advanced visualization tools use matplotlib as the base library.|||

This post contains diiferent visualization plots using date in Dataframe .Example contains Bar plot,pie plot, Line plots,Scatter Plots.
