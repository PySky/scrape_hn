So that you can be baller af when you are showing off stuff via command line

Q: Why not just run the command and pipe results to ?

A: Because you'd be stuck with 1 default font for your figlet, which gets in the way of showboating. Manually figuring out the commands to change the font involve searching for your figlet's font directory, and manually picking a font from a huge list--but not before first pruning that list from incompatible figlet font files. Having to think means increased friction, which leads to less usage. Low friction = higher usage.

NOTE: Shell will always try to interpret your input first, so for instance, if you have an apostrophe, you'll need to escape by adding double quotes around your input|||
