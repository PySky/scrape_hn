Flip a fair coin four times. Consider the cases, if any, after a heads. Since you're flipping a fair coin—you reason—you should notice no significant patterns in the flips after a heads, because flips are independent. However, you have heard of “hot streaks” or how random events become “due”, so you record your results.

You flip H T H H, and record “tails” and “heads” (bolded the flips after a heads). You flip T T H T and record “tails” from the 4th position. etc.

For each of these result sets, compute the percentage of heads flips.

Run this trial 1,000,000 times, and compute the mean of the percentage of heads.

How could this be? After a heads is flipped, another heads is only flipped 41% of the time?

Perhaps four flips per set isn't enough? You try 10.

With two million samples of empirical evidence that you can exploit randomness, you head to the race tracks…

Obviously there’s no bias in a fair coin. What’s actually happening is that we’re considering the 4-flip trial as the unit of analysis, which over-represents tails in several of the cases. Consider when two heads are flipped. The possible outcomes are—with p(H|H) (probability of heads, given a previous heads): TTHH (1), THTH (0), THHT (½), HTTH (0), HTHT (0), HHTT (½), resulting in an average p(H|H) of ⅓. The one H cases are worse: the average p(H|H) is 0.
