I have 33 years of experience in criminal defense, with the last 15 years doing death penalty work.

Oklahoma is preparing to execute an innocent man named Richard Glossip that I know there have been many discussions here on Reddit about.

If you're interested in learning more, Ian Woods of Sky News is doing a serial podcast about Richard Glossip and his quest for exoneration.

We got 250,000 signatures on a moveon petition; that was nice, but we didn't get anything for it. How does social media (chiefly, Reddit) drive this?

Right now we have an indefinite stay of execution and I'm worried about this case withering on the vine. How do we keep it in the public eye?

I'm here at the Reddit HQ in SF with u/kn0thing who is showing me around the site and helping me with this AMA. Proof: https://twitter.com/reddit/status/651175716168462336

Edit: I'm going to go talk with some big shot tech moguls (or I'm sure they think of themselves that way) here at Reddit HQ, but I'll answer another few more questions when it wraps up! Thank you very much.|||
