Slack has just rolled out message menus option for its apps. It may have a solid impact on workflow improvements within Slack. We, at Standuply, strive to help remote teams to be more productive. So weâ€™ve updated the bot to make daily standup meetings easier using message menus in Slack.

These are one of the most popular feature requests from our users:

We have foreseen Slackâ€™s features that would allow us to bring these requests to life. So, right after the latest Slack release, we began coding hard to improve Standuplyâ€™s functionality.

It took us a couple of days and nights and so weâ€™re ready to announce message menus in Standuply that weâ€™re launching next week ðŸŽ‰

From now on, every standup meeting via Standuply comes with a button Snooze and dropdown menu Select quick reply.

Using Snooze button, youâ€™re able to postpone answering the report to a later time. By clicking it, a message menu is loaded with options from 1h to 8h delay.

Also, Standuply will let others know that you canâ€™t answer at the moment:

Once the time has gone the bot will get back to you to run a standup meeting again. When you finish answering the questions, Standuply will add your responses to the daily summary.

Sometimes we report the same things as yesterday or just donâ€™t have time to do so at all. To make things easier Standuply provides you several pre-defined answers for a quick response via message menu Select quick reply.

In that case, your teammates will see the response youâ€™ve chosen from the dropdown menu. Donâ€™t overuse this feature, otherwise, whatâ€™s the point in having a standup meeting at all?

For those lucky ones weâ€™ve added a button Report now. Even if a report is missed, you can click that button, and Standuply will run a standup meeting for you again. Then the answers are attached to the daily summary so that you can catch up with others.|||
