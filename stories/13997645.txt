We’re happy to announce our first event - OpenIndore: The Kick-off this Saturday. Calling all developers, designers, data scientists, visualization experts, policy hackers, journalists and other data enthusiasts to come together and bring the Open Data Movement to Indore. Together we will work to open key crucial datasets, perform data analysis, develop data science pipelines and build data apps to grow data-driven civic-engagement in the city.

Here is the brief agenda for the day:

• What is Open? Why should we work to make Indore more Open?

• Case Studies: How is Open Data growing and creating impact across India?

Join us on our Slack Channel to help us plan this event better and contribute towards our long term community roadmap. 



We are grateful to India Infotech for being venue sponsor for this event.
