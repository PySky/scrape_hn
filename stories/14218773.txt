Auto-Recommendations for the Best Possible Data Visualization

Smart Visualization tools allow users to gather various data components and tell a story that will clarify a problem, identify an opportunity or help to make a decision. In order to build and tell that story, the business user must be able to interact with their analytics software and build the story through guided visualization and recommended data presentation to best illustrate the underlying data and issues. Business users can quickly, and efficiently produce best possible visualization of underlying data based on data type, volume, dimensions, patterns and nature of data.

Traditional data visualization is static and, while it may offer a choice of graphs and displays, it is not interactive and is not ‘Smart’ enough. In the traditional scenario, visual representations are not useful in helping users to analyze and understand data or choose the right method to display and report that data for decision-making. Smart Visualization allows the enterprise and its users to select and display data in a way that assures accurate interpretation and assumes no technical skill or need for in-depth training.|||
