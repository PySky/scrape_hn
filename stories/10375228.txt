The Thors Hammer experiment!



Getting alkali metals to explode reproducibly is hard.... and dangerous. This is a relatively safe way of getting an explosion out of potassium and ice.



You get a smallish piece of potassium (~0.1-0.3g) and mount it on a needled (or wire) taped to a hammer. It will work better if you cut it in a flat plate geometry and with the fresh cut face pointing downwards. You then hit a block of ice with that hammer. The results are impressive! Naturally, you will need all the safety kit for handling alkali metals.... notably a face shield, body covering and a decent glove.|||
