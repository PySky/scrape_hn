Lisi And Torsten have been on the road on their cycles since July and September 2014. Their agenda is simple; journey throughout the world and experience more of its people, places, and sights and learn about their life and answer their questions ultimately changing themselves.

The couple wants to experience nature and different relationships of humankind with that nature. They want to know the different problems that humans cause to nature and what it means to the people living in different places.

Throughout their journey, they have been to many different countries, learning about their culture and individual natures including Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, and Yunan and more.

 

 

 

 

 

 Recently the couple entered Pakistan and were blown away by the hearty welcomes that awaited them. They have always been looking forward to cycle through Pakistan and now that they have finally made it, they were not expecting such a positive response.

The couple explained that they were welcomed by hundreds of people throughout the three days they cycled through from Lahore to Islamabad. They have been invited over for dinner, teas and other occasions then they could have possibly accepted. On their journey, they also got to have interesting conversations with the locals and learned a lot about the Pakistani culture. At some point, Lisi Torsten even dressed up in the national dress of Pakistan to show their love for the country.

Now the couple has entered Gilgit through the Karakoram Highway and is seeking a Visa extension to stay a bit longer in Pakistan. From there on they will move towards Hunza and ultimately to China.
