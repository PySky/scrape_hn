The great thing about European Union is that we all live in a single market. There are no import duties or other protectionist taxes when you shop cross-border in EU. Unfortunately, “single market” is not exactly single when it comes to online consumer retail and the worldwide king of it — Amazon.

There are 6 European Amazon stores — EU5 + limited (books only?) store in the Netherlands. If you live anywhere in EU, but not in one of these 5–6 countries, it doesn’t make any technical difference for you from which one of these stores to buy (provided you can handle the process in their languages, but you probably know it by heart anyway).

However, when it comes to catalog selection, prices and shipping options all of them differ — sometimes symbolically, sometimes quite dramatically.

I usually shop at Amazon.co.uk and then, sometimes, fallback to Amazon.de, either to double check the price or if the thing I’m looking for is not available or can’t be shipped from co.uk. But I never go beyond that. But maybe I should?

I looked at my desk for a thing to search for and I see this Blue Yeti microphone that I used to do a podcast a while ago. Let’s see what it goes for on the European Amazon sites.

My “default” Amazon.co.uk has it for £119.99 which is roughly €142 as of now.

My fallback Amazon.de has it for €148, €149 on Amazon.es, €149.99 on Amazon.it. Looks like nothing to write home about. But then we go to Amazon.fr and bam:

They have it at €30 off! So, without doing anything crazy, like researching some new or shady eshops or hunting for it on ebay, we could save 20% by just doing 3–4 extra searches in the same eshop we know and trust.|||
