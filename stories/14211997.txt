IBM has added new capabilities to its Bluemix OpenWhisk open serverless computing platform to help expand the ability of developers to securely bring the benefits of event-driven programming to the enterprise.

As an extension of the Apache OpenWhisk project, OpenWhisk adoption has also accelerated across a range of startups building serverless innovations, which easily tap into cognitive, Internet of Things and data services to help transform industries.

These advancements point to IBM’s continued commitment to give developers the choice and flexibility to pull in the outside tools and data they need to create apps.

Running on the foundation of Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform, OpenWhisk allows developers to execute advanced code and cloud tools such as cognitive and IoT services automatically and on-demand, and without the need to manage and configure infrastructure.

The expansion of OpenWhisk also allows developers to rapidly expose serverless actions as secure and controlled APIs on the cloud. This is enabled by a new API Gateway on Bluemix OpenWhisk, which acts as gatekeeper between an external source – such as an uploaded image – and a corresponding OpenWhisk action – such as Watson Visual Recognition tagging that image.

Traditionally, developers that use serverless often must configure and secure external endpoints manually. The latest evolution of IBM’s serverless offering does this for developers automatically, helping them to more easily embed cognitive intelligence, cloud data services, and IoT sensor data within apps. OpenWhisk’s expanded user experience also tracks and analyzes usage data for each serverless action invoked, helping teams to better understand when and why different cloud services are used. These advancements point to IBM’s continued commitment to providing choice and flexibility to developers around how they pull in the outside tools and data they need to create apps.

To date, OpenWhisk adoption has accelerated across a range of startups building serverless innovations, which tap into cognitive, Internet of Things and data services to help transform industries. These companies include:

IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk is a commercial extension of the Apache OpenWhisk project, and one of the few serverless platforms developed largely by the open community. Running on the foundation of Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform, it allows developers to execute code and cloud services – such as cognitive intelligence and IoT tools – automatically and on-demand, and without the need to manage and configure infrastructure.

OpenWhisk offers one of the broadest ranges of connections into unique services such as Watson APIs and the Watson IoT Platform, as well as an expanding ecosystem of partner tools, such as Kong’s open API connector and PubNub’s data stream network for real-time applications.

Since the general availablity of OpenWhisk in late 2016, IBM has continued to expand the user experience of serverless computing, broadening its reach to multiple industries. This includes:
