This is a library that aims to provide simple GUI software development in Go.

It is based on my libui, a simple cross-platform library that does the same thing, but written in C. You must include this library in your binary distributions.

It also requires Go 1.6 or newer (due to various bugs in cgo that were fixed only starting with 1.6).

The in-code documentation needs improvement. I have written a tutorial in the Wiki.|||
