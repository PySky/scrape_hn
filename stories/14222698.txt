A header-only C++ library for capturing audio and video from multiple live sources (cameras and microphones) and

The library is useful for building video surveillance systems as well, consisting in media servers which stream and record at the same time and which can be controlled through HTTP commands (see THIS example).

The library currently runs on Linux (ALSA and V4L2 devices), but a Windows port is planned (any contribution is welcome!).

Dependencies: FFMPEG >= 3.2.4 (tested with 3.2.4 version), libevent and pkg-config (optional: see the compile command below). FFMPEG must be compiled with x264 support.

The library has been tested with the VLC and FFPLAY media players, but other players should work as well. In order to reduce the network streams' latency, use the following flags on the client side:

VLC (tested with v2.2.4: set a low value for --network-caching flag):|||
