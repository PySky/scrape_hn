This site contains an old collection of practice dynamic programming problems and their animated solutions that I put together many years ago while serving as a TA for the undergraduate algorithms course at MIT. I am keeping it around since it seems to have attracted a reasonable following on the web. Eventually, this animated material will be updated and incorporated into an algorithms textbook I am writing. -- Brian Dean

To view the solution to one of the problems below, click on its title. To view the solutions, you'll need a machine which can view Macromedia Flash animations and which has audio output. I have also included a short review animation on how to solve the integer knapsack problem (with multiple copies of items allowed) using dynamic programming.|||
