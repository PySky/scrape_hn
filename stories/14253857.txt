Most of us spend more when we’re feeling low. Whether it’s a pick-me-up shopping trip, a takeaway when we can’t face cooking, or trying to escape through the bottom of a pint glass, we’ve all been there, and paid the bills afterwards. That’s why news that Facebook may have been giving retailers and advertisers an insight into the mood of its users – including children as young as 14 – is deeply concerning.

The Sun reported yesterday on a leaked internal document setting out how marketers could track when people were feeling ‘overwhelmed’, ‘worthless’ or ‘insecure’. I haven’t seen this internal document, and Facebook says the intention was merely to help marketers understand how people express themselves, not allow them to target their adverts. But there’s a huge risk here, so it’s right to ring a huge alarm bell.

Retailers might very well want to know when people are feeling worthless or insecure: because when we’re down, our defences are down too. We’re vulnerable, and in particular we’re vulnerable to the misguided promise that stuff will make us feel better. But just like overeating or self-harm, our research shows that these kinds of purchases simply don’t work: people might feel better briefly, but then they fall into a cycle of blame and self-recrimination that simply makes them feel worse.|||

Leaked documents suggest Facebook may have used mood data to help advertisers target vulnerable users. Money and Mental Health blogs about the risks.
