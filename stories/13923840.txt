I’m an optimist, and, among the CIO community, I’m in very good company.  In fact, leading a transformation is itself an act of optimism and a leap of faith, driven by a deep desire to make a meaningful difference and an unwavering belief in the strategic vision being undertaken. Core to that optimism is the belief that most of the people in your organization who’ve been so dedicated and loyal can make the transformation along with you.
