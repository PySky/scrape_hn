Since it’s launch in 1995, the Apache HTTP Server has been the stable, reliable workhorse of the Internet.

As a key component of your production infrastructure, Apache needs to be monitored for health and performance. Read on to see how.

In OpsDash, you can easily set alerts like “if number of number of 5xx responses per second exceed 100, notify me on Slack” in just a few clicks.

Here is how the Response Codes graphs looks in detail:

All that is needed for this level of monitoring is to have exactly 4 lines in your OpsDash Smart Agent configuration file – like this:

The configuration has 3 entries (they show up as 3 separate dashboards in the UI), one for the main Apache server, one for a single virtual host, and another for all the virtual hosts combined.

Read on to see how the OpsDash Smart Agent actually monitors your Apache servers.

For maximum portability and flexibility, the OpsDash Smart Agent relies on access logs, rather than the mod_status module of Apache. Practically, parsing the log files are fast, efficient, unintrusive, and yields nearly as much information as other methods.

The OpsDash Smart Agent reads and parses a given set of access log files each minute, and reports the values to the OpsDash servers. It reads in and parses only as much portion of the access log file as is needed to extract the recent most minute’s worth of metrics, so the parsing process is very light on the server’s resources.

Apache log files live under or , depending upon your Linux distribution and Apache version. By default, there is typically an access log file and an error log file. The access log file is typically of the “combined log format”.

The combined log format is a defacto standard for HTTP access logs, and is used by default by both Apache and Nginx servers. Although Apache and Nginx allows you to customize the format, there is a lot of tooling that work with combined log format logs that it makes sense to leave the default unchanged.

Apache’s directives for manipulating the log formats, and the description of the combined log format can be found here.

Here is how a single entry in this format looks like:

The fields, in order are:

From these fields, the OpsDash Smart Agent computes and reports the following metrics:
