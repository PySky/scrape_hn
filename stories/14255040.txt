Software engineers have a term called Rubber Duck Debugging. It describes the phenomenon when you talk about your programming problem out loud and you solve the problem without input from anyone else.

A former coworker and I used to go to each other to help solve problems we were stuck on. As soon as we started explaining the problem to the other one, we found the solution without the other one saying a word. We might as well have been talking to rubber duck instead of each other.

This strategy works surprisingly well for non-programming problems too.

By talking about what the problem is, what feelings you have, and what the ideal outcome is, youâ€™ll end up solving the problem.

Next time you feel like you have an unsolvable problem on a project, an annoying coworker, or a bad day, try finding a rubber duck.|||
