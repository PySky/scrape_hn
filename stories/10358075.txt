I was invited as one of the speakers at the ApacheCon core conference in Budapest, Hungary on October 1-2, 2015.

I was once again spreading the news about HTTP/2, why it was made and how it works and of course: updated numbers on adoption right now.

The talk was unfortunately not filmed, but I’ve put my slides for this version of my talk online. Readers of this blog and those who’ve seen my presentations before will recognize large parts of it.

Following my talk was talks about mod_http2, the Apache module for HTTP/2 that will be coming in the upcoming 2.4.17 release of Apache Httpd, explained by its author Stefan Eissing. The name of the module was actually a bit of a surprise to me since it has been known as just mod_h2 for its entire life time up until now.

William A Rowe took us through the state of TLS for the main Apache servers and yeah, the state seem to be pretty good and they’re coming along really well. TLS and then HTTPS is important as that’s really a prerequisite for HTTP/2

I also got to listen to Mark Thomas explain the agonies of making Tomcat support HTTP/2, and then perhaps especially how ALPN and a good set of ciphers are hard to get in Java.

Jean-Frederic Clere then explained how to activate HTTP/2 on all the Apache servers (tomcat, httpd and traffic server) and a little about their HTTP/2 state, following with an explanation how they worked on tomcat to make that use OpenSSL for the TLS layer (including ALPN) to avoid the deadlock of decent TLS support in Java.

All in all, a great track and splendid talks with deep technical content. Exactly the way I like it. Thanks everyone. Apachecon certainly delivered for me! Twas fun.|||
