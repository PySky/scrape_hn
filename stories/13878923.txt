The Kubernetes landscape has been altered slightly, so we talked to the movers behind the change. In this episode of The New Stack Makers podcast, we spoke with Sebastien Goasguen, the founder of Skippbox, a start-up that specialized in applications for managing the Kubernetes container orchestration engine. Today, cloud software package manager Bitnami announced that it is acquiring Skippbox, so our discussion ranged from the acquisition to also include Sebastien’s experience with customers using Kubernetes.

In this episode, we talk about Bitnami’s motivations for the acquisition, and what it will change for how they approach the Kubernetes ecosystem. We also ask Sebastien about his experience building on top of Kubernetes, including solutions such as Kompose and Kubeless. He shares the experiences of some customers, as well as what he sees as forthcoming topics of interest for the Kubernetes community:
