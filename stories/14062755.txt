Businesses and organizations can benefit from cloud computing, but many don’t want the cost, performance and governance concerns of public cloud nor the complexity and operational overhead of building their own private clouds.

Today, some cloud vendors are using artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify private cloud deployment and management, making it possible for clouds to be self-driving (i.e., self-installing, self-healing and self-managing). In this article, we’ll look at the requirements for a self-driving cloud and how to implement them.

Just like any other technology in this space, one needs several systems to work well together, whch handle self-monitoring, healing, learning and which create models for self-optimization.

Here is a list of technologies that need to be present for self-driving clouds:
