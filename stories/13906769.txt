A really important bit of advice to programmers who consider themselves really smart.

An obscure, highly abstracted, hard to understand program doesn’t help anyone. Oh sure, you came up with some really clever code that involves a lot of magic and you’re really proud of yourself. A year from now when this needs to be changed, people are going to be banging their heads trying to understand just what the hell you did.

Always think of the next guy who has to maintain or enhance your code. They’re going to be under stress, probably with a deadline looming. They will have no clue what was going through your head when you invented this crazy thing. It’s not worth it.

Your code’s intent should be immediately obvious. Don’t skip comments explaining why it works the way it does. Spell things out. Be Captain Obvious. You don’t like it when you have to change someone else’s crazy code. So don’t be that guy.|||
