Some of these settings lines, like version, are for general information that will pertain to any site you want to use Yoast for. Other settings, like company_logo, company_name  and person_name should be changed for each new site you want to optimize with the Yoast SEO plugin. To make the file useful for the plugins on any site, you’ll want to delete all of this specific information to leave it blank so you can fill it in with different information for each individual site you optimize with the plugin. Some of these settings, like company_name or person_name, can stay unchanged and filled in if all of the work you do is for one specific company or person. Otherwise, you’ll want to delete everything that’s specific to one individual client or project, especially brand identity and social media settings.|||

Skip the Yoast SEO's configuration wizard and instead setup reusable templates to save time for each website and/or client!
