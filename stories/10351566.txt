When was the last time you were late to work because you got stuck at the back of an endless line waiting for your mislabeled coffee? Did you ever think THIS could be your office? You could skip the commute, bring your laptop and charger, and work remotely from anywhere, wherever you are.

Remote work is booming, whether you’re working from home, your favorite coffee shop, a coworking space, or somewhere else entirely. A Virgin Media Business survey predicted in 2012 that 60% of office-based employees will regularly work from home by 2022—the number was already approaching 40% in the US in 2015 according to a Gallup poll. And a separate survey featured in The Guardian found that ⅓ of employees think commuting will be unheard of by 2036.

Remote jobs are already a reality for so many people! . And not just for 20-somethings working on a startup who code in hoodies, or stay-at-home moms who work as part-time assistants. There are companies hiring remote workers (usually with tech skills) all over the world, doing all sorts of different jobs.

The typical remote employee is a 40-something college graduate earning nearly $60,000 a year at a company with 100+ employees, according to the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey.
