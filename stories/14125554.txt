Most large cities use trunked radio systems to get the most use out of their assigned radio spectrum. With trunked systems, the transmission are constantly hopping to different frequencies. Only top of the line radio scanner are able to follow these transmission and even those scanners are limited to capturing a single transmission at a time.

It often gets said that Software wil eat the World, and that is certainly true here. Using a cheap Software Defined Radio (SDR), it is possible capture all of the transmission on a system. Scanners try to determine which frequency a group is using and tune into that specific frequency. SDRs make it possible to capturea wide swatch of spectrum, covering all of the frequencies a system could use. Using software it is possible to decode which groups are using which frequencies and extract those transmission from that broad swatch of spectrum.

Trunk Recorder is a Linux program that I wrote, that is being used to capture all of the recordings on this site. This website makes it easy for folks running Trunk-Recorder to share their recordings.

Join us! Record a local radio system and share it with the world. If you have a spare computer, it is easy to get started. With a $25 SDR or two, you can capture an entire system. It does take a little bit of work to get things setup, but we are here to help and answer questions.|||
