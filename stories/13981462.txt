We’ve all flipped through old family albums and the comments are usually, “Dad, who’s that in this pic?”, “Where is this?” or “When was this taken?”.

Sunrise allows us to share our perspective and help tell a more complete story of your life in your family photo books. Now you can see life through your family’s eyes and discover what they consider to be defining moments. In short, you get to know your own family a little better and that’s a huge plus.

In version 1.20, we added weather to the annotations of a memory, in addition to location and the written story.

To complete the story, photo books printed from Sunrise include the images and written memories for your kids to enjoy years from now.

Sunrise is available for iOS. You can follow us on Facebook.|||
