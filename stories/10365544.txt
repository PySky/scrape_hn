Low-energy devices are expected to become a cornerstone of the Internet of Things [internet connected devices in our homes and offices].

So if you want to deploy a sensor or a beacon but you don’t want to use wires for a fixed power supply, because it’s in a hard to reach place or you want it to be movable, and you really want to avoid the cost of replacing batteries, then Freevolt is the answer.

We’re working in two ways to improve Freevolt in the future.

One is to make the technology more efficient so we can reduce its form factor and still harvest the same amount of energy. This will make Freevolt easier to integrate into other electronics and also allow us to make the antenna flexible such that you can put it into materials that bend, like wearable devices.

At the other extreme we’re working on larger antennas and arrays of antennas to increase the amount of energy that can be harvested, for use in buildings.

So on one end going smaller, and on the other end going bigger and exploring applications in the building industry.

Drayson’s CleanSpace Tag is currently crowdfunding, get your hands on one of the first wave of Freevolt-powered Tags here.

Look out for The Memo’s review of the CleanSpace Tag coming soon.|||
