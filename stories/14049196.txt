In this post I wanted to tell you more about magic that happens when you use your Sonos with Yeti. I am not going to talk on and on about awesomeness of the Sonos speakers. If you are on this site you either already have a Sonos and know how to be a happy user or you are planning to buy it soon (and taking into consideration the price) you do your research good. In both cases you are not a newbie.

- no plugging devices, no cables all over the place - all you have to do is click and enjoy,

- Ability to listen to the same music in the whole house in perfect sync,

- Ability to play different music in different rooms

- “Room filled with music” and other Sonos’ marketing catch phrases that you surprisingly agree with.

Yes, you know all that. You also know that Sonos speakers have a really good app that handles it all and makes you even more addicted to their product. Now why do I bother you with this post if you already “have it all”?

Here’s the thing - Smart devices are awesome, because they give you control, safety and  convenience  on a level that you have never experienced before. Managing your surroundings only with you phone is quite incredible, even addictive at some point. According to statistics the vast majority of the smart device users get another one or are planning to do so. Are you one of them? Do you have 2 devices, maybe even more? Do you think about having another one and another one? If  the financial barrier is not a problem for you, then why not? Smart devices make life so much easier and fun.

The strange thing is that even though getting more of them should make it easier for you, it simply doesn’t. Who cares that your devices are smart if you cannot control them all in a smart way, because every product needs its own app? There it is - The control of 2 or more different devices can be really irritating and time-consuming if you need a lot of apps to do so.|||

A few words about awesome speakers, our tendencies to get addicted to IoT with every smart device and Yeti's strive for seamless automation.
