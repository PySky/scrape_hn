Iteration is an essential part of building anything, be it an application, a company...even a developer program. Over the past few months we've had conversations with thousands of developers from all over the globe. Thanks to the insights and feedback shared with us, today we're announcing two exciting changes to the program.

First, we're opening access to the Developer Program to users without a paid account. That means almost any developer, at any stage of production, can take advantage of this opportunity. Second, we've introduced participation levels that will allow members to receive not only benefits from GitHub and our partners, but a path to successful development for your next great application.

If you're just getting started, or need a little help getting off the ground, this level provides you with tools to learn more about the GitHub API and join our integrator community, such as dedicated Developer Program content and events.

At this crucial stage, you've already launched a successful app â€” now we'll help you grow by taking full advantage of level 1 benefits as well as GitHub.com credits and network discounts.

At this level, you're maintaining your successful application, and thinking about how to grow. You'll receive level 1 and 2 benefits, as well as GDP member spotlights and consulting services to help you scale successfully, among other rewards.

If you're already enrolled in the GitHub Developer Program, no action is needed on your end. You will receive an email detailing your level, as well as your benefits. If you'd like to join the GitHub Developer Program, visit our homepage to sign up.
