LiveJournal recently changed their Terms of Service. Many people are unwilling to accept the new Terms of Service. Some people even find them so unacceptable that they want to delete their LiveJournal accounts.

The only way to delete one's LiveJournal account is via the Account Status page. Unfortunately, it's impossible to access that page without accepting the new Terms of Service, since the "NEW USER AGREEMENT" pop-up appears on every page of the LiveJournal site, preventing the user from accessing the page until they have accepted the new agreement.

Fortunately, however, this is enforced in client-side code. Here, you will find a tiny Google Chrome extension which, if you install it into Chrome and then browse the Account Status page, will make the ToS pop-up go away, so that you can delete your account.

One the extension is installed, browse to the Account Status page and you should be able to delete your account.
