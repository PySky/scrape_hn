Need to encode, transmit, or store encrypted or signed data? saltpack is a streamlined, modern solution, designed with simplicity in mind. It is easy to implement & integrate. We've made few crypto decisions and instead leave almost all of the heavy lifting to the NaCl library.

saltpack is a binary message format, encoded using the MessagePack format. Messages are broken up into reasonable (1MB) chunks, over which regular NaCl operations are performed. We have taken pains to address many of the shortcomings of current message formats: (1) only authenticated data is output; (2) repudiable authentication is used wherever possible; (3) chunks cannot be reordered or combined with other transmissions; (4) the public keys of senders and recipients can be hidden; and (5) message truncation is detectable.

Visually speaking, a saltpack ASCII output looks a lot like PGP's. Here's a side-by-side comparison. Resize your window to see it at various device sizes:

The changes here are small: we've reduced our characters to base62 plus some period markers, and only at the ends of words. PGP messages often get mangled by different apps, websites, and smart text processors.

Of course, saltpack can output binary, too. Either way, it's what's inside the format that matters. You can read the spec for the details.|||
