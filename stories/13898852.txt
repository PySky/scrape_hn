1.0: February 28, 2017: Initial release

 1.1: March 1, 2017: Fixed versions affected for Issue #6 (summary table was correct, detailed information was incorrect)

 1.2: March 2, 2017: Added Veritas Access versions.  Added CVEs that have been assigned to date.

 1.3: March 8, 2017: Added remaining CVEs.  Fixed Issues #3 and #10 to indicate they only affect the NetBackup Server, not the NetBackup client.

 1.4: April 26, 2017: Added fix for Issue #6, link to Tech Alert.

A local user on a NetBackup server can execute an arbitary command on the NetBackup server or cause the server to execute an arbitrary command on a connected NetBackup client.  The command will execute with root/admin privileges.

A local user on a NetBackup server or client can execute an arbitrary command on the local system.  The command will execute with root/admin privileges.  This is a separate issue from Issue #1 described above.

An authenticated user that can communicate with the NetBackup server can cause a denial of service.

A local user on a NetBackup server can execute an arbitrary command on the NetBackup server or cause the server to execute an arbitrary command on a connected NetBackup client.  The command will execute with root/admin privileges.  This is a different issue from Issues #1 and #2 above.

NetBackup services can execute commands on the local system from a whitelist of directories. A local user can escape that whitelist by using one or more “../” as part of a path to execute any command on the system.

Local arbitrary command execution when using bpcd and bpnbat

bpcd runs as root/admin and can execute any NetBackup command. bpnbat can execute any command on the local system. If bpcd is used to execute bpnbat then in combination they can be used to execute any command on the system as root/admin.

NetBackup relies on host names to ensure that it is communicating with the correct client or server. This is vulnerable to DNS spoofing.

pbx_exchange creates sockets that any process can connect to and then changes the permissions so that only root processes can connect. In the time between creation and the permission change an unprivileged local process could connect to pbx_exchange and impersonate a legitimate component.

If logging is enabled many of the log files used by NetBackup are world writable, allowing an attacker to corrupt those files.

The NetBackup Cloud Storage Service connector uses a hardcoded username and password. An attacker using these credentials can query and modify the configuration and delete data.

Unauthenticated CORBA interfaces permit an attacker to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of NetBackup.
