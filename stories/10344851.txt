Time series data is any data that has a timestamp. This can be IoT device data, financial and economic data, or even scientific and health data. To provide optimal performance it is useful for the database to have some knowledge about the structure and format of the time series data

- Time series data often has a higher write load requirement than key value use cases and therefore requires high performance reads and writes even with a huge number of data sources.

- To more efficiently analyze time or location data, related time series data needs to be co-located on the same physical storage on the same vnode.

- The time series NoSQL data model requires flexibility to support both structured and semi-structured data as well as the ability to write range queries to analyze your time series data.

- Time series data is often collected at frequent intervals which may not be relevant as data ages. The data will often be rolled up, compressed and the granular details expired.|||
