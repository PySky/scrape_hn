This project seeks to document 54xx/74xx-series logic chips and subfamilies by imaging and annotating their dies and tracing out their schematics. These chips usually have no more than 100 transistors, making them easy to understand. They are in the small- or medium-scale integration range. Other series may be represented, but for now we are predominantly concentrating on 54xx and 74xx chips.

It's a Texas Instruments SN5474 flip flop in a metal/glass hermetic package from 1969. SN stood for Semiconductor Network, which was a synonym for Integrated Circuit. The 54 series was introduced by TI in 1964, following on from the original type 504 flip flop (1960), and the digital logic series 51 (1961), 52 (1962), and 53 (1964).

See the main article on techniques, or a quick five-minute video tour.

These are chips and variants that the project has. The variant "x" means standard. If the row is highlighted and there's a link in the Number column, then there is at least one die image available. The link goes to a page showing details about the variants in inventory. That page in turn has links to the individual chip instances as well as to related chips. But why describe that here: pick a chip and explore!
