To deliver the new programs, each store will receive new Forum Displays, mobile screens created by Apple’s design team specifically for Today at Apple sessions, and updated seating and sound, along with wall displays to showcase the products that help customers get the most out of their Apple products.

“Today at Apple” will launch worldwide in May, with sessions in every store.|||
