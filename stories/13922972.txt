With our co-browsing API you can make any website or web application a realtime collaboration tool. Surfly is the transparant layer that will allow your clients and representatives to communicate with each other using your website as a backdrop.

Surfly gives you full control of how a co-browsing session should behave and look. For example, should a web-sharing session be started by an agent or a client? Should the session be started through a button or through an invitation mail? Should the session be opened in a new tab or in an iframe? Etc.

Some of our clients use our API to add a support button to their website, others embed Surfly in their chat solution and again others built complete advisor portals around our technology. This can all be done by simply using our API.|||
