Tech companies in general, and Silicon Valley companies in particular, dominate a just-released list of the 25 highest-paying employers in the United States compiled by on-line recruitment firm Glassdoor. Providers of software and tech services claimed the most spots, but a few hardware providers—like graphics processing chip company Nvidia and network hardware maker Juniper—made the cut as well. Companies involved in networking, cloud computing, and data analytics have a big presence on the list. The only non-tech companies among their ranks, according to this analysis, are in the management consulting business.

As Glassdoor chief economist Andrew Chamberlain explained in a blog post, consulting firms pay high salaries because they want their employees to have established personal contacts and relationships in specialized fields.

“In technology,” he wrote, “we continue to see unprecedented salaries as the war for talent is still very active, largely due to the ongoing shortage of highly skilled workers needed.”

The Silicon Valley companies in the top 25 are:

Tech companies outside the Bay Area that made the high-salaries list included Dimension Data, Broadcom, Microsoft, F5 Networks, and Akamai.
