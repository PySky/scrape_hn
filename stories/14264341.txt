The idea of building a dashboard application has become synonymous to the idea of a developer thinking let us build a "To-do" application.

This is evident by the sheer amount of dashboard related applications that developers/founders have submitted to Hacker News over the past several years.

The dashboards range from wide spectrum, on one side to personal dashboards, project management dashboards, network dashboards to full blown social media dashboards.
