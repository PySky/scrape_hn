Ohio replaced a 40-year-old computer system for tracking liquor sales and distribution two years ago at a cost of $21 million, with the promise that the system for running the state-controlled liquor business would be more accurate and reliable.

The new system has been a disaster of inaccurate inventory data, unreliable purchasing orders and incorrect sales information, according to about a dozen distillers, retailers and distributors, as well as state documents.
