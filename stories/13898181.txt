I don’t tell you about the unknown. Even though it’s known to me.

I won’t tell you what something doesn’t do. Though I know what you want to do instead.

I don’t tell you about the quirks. I don’t want to believe in them.

I don’t clarify how this thing is different from that other thing. I let you figure that out instead.

I don’t tell you why it’s this way. It’s none of your business.

I don’t tell you what I don’t know. Though I know I don’t know it.

I didn’t discover what I didn’t know. I wasn’t curious enough.

I didn’t revise something old. Though I knew it was moldy.

I was wrong. It took too long. I used too many words. I didn’t use enough.

My code sample was only hypothetical.

I didn’t ask for help.

My argument for how it could be different did not win.|||
