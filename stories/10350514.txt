Rahul "the pappu" Ghandy. The most envied "employed" person in the world. 



56 days, off the grid. 



His job,  Member of Parliament representing the constituency of Amethi.



When?

Why, it was bang right in the middle of a parliamentary session,  a pretty important one at that. 

And he was also a leader of his party. 



I mean, seriously who gets 8 weeks of vacation, without a medical reason, right at the peak period in your job. 



Seeing, year after year, PTOs lapsing on me - unused, I am bloody jealous of the guy. 



On the other hand, that was 56 days he did no damage to the country or the political discourse.|||
