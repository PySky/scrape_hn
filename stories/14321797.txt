If you believe that Digitalization is a passing trend then you are completely mistaken. Digitalization won’t stop, not now, and certainly not in the future. It’s better to get on board than to stick your head in the sand and hope for the storm to pass. Get out of the standard IT and into decentralized, collaboration with customers.This is the only way to successfully transform into a digital business.

Digitalization includes new assets and technologies to develop and integrate differentiating applications at a rapid speed, and with the flexibility, needed as digitalization opens up unprecedented new business opportunities to enterprises fast enough to take them

In combining people, business and things they also have to adapt their IT systems to rapidly changing business conditions. To complete this transformation to a fully digital enterprise, it requires unprecedented understanding and cooperation between IT and business decision makers.

As Digital transformation evolves and grows, companies will need to respond quickly to changing consumer behavior and consequently adapt their offerings and internal processes accordingly. This requires faster development cycles for IT applications, and web methods such as DevOps, that can play a critical role in helping make this happen.”|||
