Hi! For SIGBOVIK 2017, I created a strange paper. This one may be a bit impenetrable for non computer scientists. If you have the time, I think reading the paper is the best way to experience it. But I also created the following video that explains the ideas involved, for interested non-experts or patient experts. It's long, at about 25 minutes, but you can always just skip to the end:

The paper in raw form is available as PAPER.EXE or PAPER.TXT (same file). Due to unreasonable SIGBOVIK deadlines, it's been updated a little compared to the version that appeared in SIGBOVIK 2017 (bibtex).

The source code I used to create the paper is here.
