Denis Grisak, the man behind the Internet-connected garage opener Garadget, is having a very bad week. Grisak and his Colorado-based company SoftComplex launched Garadget, a device built using Wi-Fi-based cloud connectivity from Particle, on Indiegogo earlier this year, hitting 209 percent of his launch goal in February. But this week, his response to an unhappy customer has gotten Garadget a totally different sort of attention.

On April 1, a customer who purchased Garadget on Amazon using the name R. Martin reported problems with the iPhone application that controls Garadget. He left an angry comment on the Garadget community board:

Shortly afterward, not having gotten a response, Martin left a 1-star review of Garadget on Amazon:

Grisak then responded by bricking Martin's product remotely, posting on the support forum:

The abusive language here and in your negative Amazon review, submitted minutes after experiencing a technical difficulty, only demonstrates your poor impulse control. I'm happy to provide the technical support to the customers on my Saturday night but I'm not going to tolerate any tantrums. At this time your only option is return Garadget to Amazon for refund. Your unit ID 2f0036... will be denied server connection.

The exchange then went viral, being picked up by the Twitter account @internetofshit and rising to the top of Hacker News.

Ok, calm down everybody. Save your pitchforks and torches for your elected representatives. This only lack the death treats[sic] now. The firing of the customer was never about the Amazon review, just wanted to distance from the toxic individual ASAP. Admittedly not a slickest PR move on my part. Note taken.

When Ars reached out to Grisak, he responded that, following his update post, “There isn't much more to add.”|||
