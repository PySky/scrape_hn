The Snickerdoodle doesn't cut corners when it comes to physical connections either. The board offers up to eight physical connectors for use with 0.05" pitch headers or wire bundles (Figure 2).

The combination of built-in wireless connectivity and a hybrid ARM/FPGA SoC is certainly a new feature in low-cost boards such as Arduino, Beaglebone, or Raspberry Pi. In contrast to the usual low-cost kits, the Krtkl team is looking to offer a dev kit that delivers "â€¦professional-level hardware at maker-friendly prices and a democratization of advanced technologies," according to a company statement. Indeed, the Snickerdoodle's combination of performance and features gives it an edge in functionality above the typical maker board (Table 2).

Krtkl is looking to steal not only a march on the competition but also help existing Raspberry Pi and Arduino users reuse their existing hardware on Snickerdoodle. Along with application-specific baseboards such as an autopilot system for drones, Krtkl plans to offer baseboards designed to go head-to-head with Raspberry Pi and Arduino (Figure 3).

The Snickerdoodle crowdfunding campaign is running now on crowdsupply. Funding ends on Nov 21, 2015. The company is touting the board and add-ons in a short video (below).|||
