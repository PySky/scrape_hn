Frequency Response

 A quantitative measure of a systems gain at various frequencies in response to a signal injected into the system. A linear system will respond at the same frequency with a certain magnitude and phase relative to the input. A "Flat" frequency response, when the gain is constant at all frequencies, is generally most desirable although can never be completely achieved. For example, a gain of two at both 20 Hertz and 20kHz, and at all frequencies in between. 

 



Harmonic Distortion

 Distortion artifacts that are exact integer distances higher in frequency than the originating tone, usually a result of non-linearities in the transfer function of an analog electronic device. For example: 1kHz might yeild a little distortion at 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 5kHz, etc. Typically, it is thought the even harmonics (2, 4, 6, 8) sound better than odd harmonics (3, 5, 7, 9). This is somewhat true, but a gross oversimplification of the subject. 

 



Impedance

 The sum of both resistive and reactive impeding forces of a load. Headphone impedance commonly changes with frequency, and would become somewhat inductive or capacitive at different frequencies. 

 



Isolation

 The ability of a pair of headphones to block outside sounds so that the listener can hear the music on the headphones more clearly. Can be measured as a broad band reduction in amplitude in a single number in dB; or shown as a graph indicating the amount of attenuation over the audio spectrum. 

 



Square Wave Response

 An audio test signal which alternates between two D.C. levels. Used to visualize the systems ability to pass a wide range of frequencies in proper time-alignment.
