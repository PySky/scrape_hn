To provide insight into the evolution of regional drainage, we produced structure-from-motion digital elevation models (SfM DEM) of the proglacial environment of Kaskawulsh Glacier from drone (DJI Phantom 3 Pro) and helicopter imagery, using a Trimble R10 real-time kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK-GNSS) to establish ground control points and survey lake outlet elevations. We processed drone and helicopter photos to point clouds using Agisoft Photoscan and converted them to DEMs in ArcGIS 10.3. We were unable to estimate vertical errors by comparing the photo-based DEMs with other DEM sources, because the terrain over which the drone data were acquired changed over time. Instead, we conservatively estimate the error to be 1 m (ref. 30).

We compared high- and medium-resolution satellite (WorldView, SPOT-5, and Landsat) time series of the glacier terminus and digitized the extent of proglacial lakes from Landsat images acquired between 1972 and 2016 (Supplementary Table 1). A 2-m-resolution DEM derived from along-track stereo WorldView-1 imagery was constructed using the SETSM algorithm31. We used this DEM to calculate gradients for the uppermost 4 km of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers. Topographic profiles of the entire length of each river were constructed from ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) v2 data. ASTER GDEM is a product of NASA and METI. The ASTER GDEM v2 has an RMSE of ~8.7 m and an absolute vertical error of 17 m (ref. 29).

We examined gauge records for Slims River, Kaskawulsh River and Kluane Lake for the period of interest and collected discharge data for Slims River in September 2016, after the piracy event, using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp; 1,200 kHz Teledyne RiverPro) mounted on a tethered boat. An Environment Canada water-level gauge in Kluane Lake (#09ca001), near the mouth of Slims River (61° 03′ 16′′ N, 138° 30′ 21′′ W), has been operating since late 1952, with a data gap between 1987 and 1993. Another Environment Canada gauge on Alsek River (#08ab001; 60° 07′ 05′′ N, 137° 58′ 39′′ W), approximately 115 km downstream of Kaskawulsh Lake, has recorded discharge almost daily since 1974. Data from Slims River were obtained using a Campbell Scientific SR50 sonic ranger installed on the Slims River bridge at the south end of Kluane Lake (61° 00′ 04′′ N, 138° 30′ 36′′ W) in June 2014, with gaps during winter due to solar power outages. The SR50 sonic ranger measures distance to the water surface. We corrected temperature-induced differences in the speed of sound using an adjacent temperature sensor and then converted these distances to water depth by calculating the distance of the SR50 sensor to the riverbed. We summed the width-averaged water depths determined from an aDcp transect with an SR50 reading made at the same time and day. We assume that bed elevation did not change during the period of acquisition. This height was then differenced from the SR50 readings to the water surface to yield an estimate of water depth.

A meteorological station located on a nunatak between the north and central arms of Kaskawulsh Glacier (60° 44′ 32′′ N, 139° 09′ 59′′ W, 1,845 m a.s.l.), approximately 30 km upglacier (west–southwest) from the glacier terminus, provided air temperatures for the period 2007–2016. Temperatures were measured with a Campbell Scientific 107F temperature probe, with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C, and recorded hourly on a Campbell Scientific CR10x logger. We also acquired data from the Environment Canada meteorological station at Haines Junction (station ID 2100630, 60° 46′ 21′′ N, 137° 34′ 49′′ W, 595 m a.s.l.), approximately 55 km east of the terminus of Kaskawulsh Glacier. We used the daily mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures at this station from 2007 to 2016, together with the total daily precipitation from January to June 2016.

We evaluated whether the retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier might be due to natural variability using the method developed by Roe and colleagues12. The results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The width-averaged retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier between 1899 and 2016 was 1.9 km, based on an average of 13 distance measurements taken across the glacier terminus following the methodology of Foy and colleagues9. The 2016 terminus position was determined from a Landsat 8 image acquired on 8 October 2016. The position of the terminus in 1899 was recorded by a series of oblique photos taken by A.H. Brooks during a surveying expedition, which we acquired from the National Archives, Ottawa, Canada32.

The method of Roe et al. is summarized as follows. Let ΔL be the change in glacier length over the past 130 years (~1.9 km), and let σ be the standard deviation of glacier length due to stochastic fluctuations in mass balance, b, from natural, interannual climate variability. The signal-to-noise ratio is defined by s = ΔL/σ . Likewise, s = Δb/σ . Ref. 12 demonstrates that the two are related via s = γs , where γ is an amplification factor that depends only on the duration of the trend and the glacier response time, τ. The probability density function (PDF) for s is generated by combining the signal-to-noise ratios of the observed melt-season temperature and annual-mean precipitation trends, normalized by the summer (b ) and winter (b ) mass-balance variability (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, c), respectively. We take σ = 0.3 myr−1 and σ = 0.5 myr−1, based on the observed mass-balance variability at Gulkana Glacier and the analysis of the global datasets of glacier mass balance33. The glacier response time is given by τ = −H/b , where H is a characteristic glacier thickness, and b is the (negative) net mass balance at the terminus. We set H = 590 m, based on the scaling relationship for glacier geometry suggested by Haeberli and Hoelzle34 and measured cross-sections35; and we set b = −7 myr−1, estimated by extrapolating the vertical mass-balance profiles calculated by Flowers et al. 8, thus giving a central estimate for τ of ~80 years. A PDF is estimated assuming τ follows a gamma distribution incorporating a broad uncertainty of σ = τ/4 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The PDFs for γ and s are combined to give a PDF for σ from the relation σ = γΔL|obss . This, in turn, is used to evaluate the null hypothesis that ΔL|obs occurred due to natural variability. Supplementary Fig. 1e shows our estimate that there is only a 0.5% chance that the observed retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier happened in the absence of a climate trend.

River piracy[mdash]the diversion of one stream/'s headwaters into another[mdash]has occurred on long timescales. An analysis of streamflow and digital elevation models documents river re-routing in response to glacier retreat in Yukon, Canada in May 2016.
