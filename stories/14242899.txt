You are getting to start with automating of your JavaScript testing. There are lots of questions and then you will probably look at the people to talk about the Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). If you can keep up to date with the latest development of software practices and odds, then you have to hear of TDD and BDD. The freelance tips are meant to be explained what practice means, providing examples and then difference the two. Let’s take a see at the TDD and BDD as well as some fixed common misconceptions about them.

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a process of when you can write and runs on your test. It is possible to make following instructions and also have very high test coverage. The test coverage is referred to your code percentage that is automatically tested so the higher code number is much better. Test Driven Development is reduced as a likelihood of having a bug in your test, which is otherwise so difficult to their track down. The TDD process can consist of some following steps that are given below:

It can take more efforts to learn, but you can spend less time that pays off big. The TDD project gets code coverage from 90 to 100 percent, which means easy to maintain their codes and added a new feature. Because you have many sets of tests so you will trust your code and change work as well as you did not break any other codes either.

You must be used xUnit Style of testing tool to use in the TDD process. This is not a great case; TDD is a great to work with unit test and given freelance tips applied other testing methods. It does not be required any specific tool or syntax.

Behavior Driven Development is one of the largest sources of confusion. You will apply to automated testing process and then BDD is having some set of best practices so you can write a great test. BDD should be used together with the testing method of TDD. The BDD address is one of the key things, which is implemented in the detailed information of unit test. Common problems with a poor unit test are relying too much upon how to implement the test function. That means if you will update all functions without any change of input and output. You must update the test functions. This is a common problem because it will make to do changing tedious.

Behavior Driven Development address is a problem by showing on how to test. You cannot be tested on the implementation but instead of that behavior. Let’s show an example of what happening when you will think about the implementation and behavior:

You will hire freelancers that give a unit test of their imaginary counter objects. After the test process, you will call on the tick that value should be one, which makes a sound like a sense. There is a problem in the test, which is completely depending on the facts that counter start at zero. In the other words, a test is relying on the two things.

Above mentioned facts, a counter will start on the zero, which is implemented in a detailed process that is related to the behavior of tick function. It cannot have any bear on the test that is the main reason you will write the test like that because you are thinking about the implementation but not a behavior.

Behavior Driven Development is suggested to the test behavior. Instead of that, you will think on how to implement your test code and spend some moments. BDD test is typically in the form of phrase like BDD can do something. For ticking counter, BDD should be incremented as a count one by one.

The choice of between BDD and TDD is one of the complicated ones. It depends on that it is appropriate of a testing framework for given target language, what coworkers are more comfortable to work with you and other factors. Some arguments of BDD is always much better than the TDD because it has some possibilities of eliminating the issue that may arise when you are using TDD. The key of BDD may be prevented issues, but not guaranteed to solve it. Issues like a bad design practice and poor code organization that still persists. You will have a low likelihood of writing bad test and have many robust features

A person knows how to write a great TDD test that can have a few bugs and sometimes know how to write a great BDD test. If you will hire freelancers to write an incomplete test by using TDD, then you need to design much better software. Finally, it will give BDD shot. If you’re a new to both BDD and TDD, which is highly recommended to learn and use of TDD. The most important part of TDD and BDD styles are to write a test for your own code. If you do not test your own code and then you need to both BDD and TDD. Although you can be used each TDD and BDD individually and then both are combined them for getting the best result as they are complementing each other nicely.|||
