Microsoft has updated its Windows Store policies to ban developers from creating apps that emulate games. Nesbox's Universal Emulator app for playing Nintendo and Sega ROMs has been removed from the Store following the update. Nesbox was one of the more popular emulators on the Windows Store, allowing Windows 10 users to play games using an Xbox One controller.

PC Gamer reports that the app is still available outside of the Windows Store, but the developer has confirmed Nesbox has been removed by Microsoft. It appears Microsoft updated its store policies on March 29th to ban game emulators, as the previous policy revision in January didn’t include “Apps that emulate a game system are not allowed on any device family.”

While it might seem surprising that Microsoft ever allowed game emulators in the Windows Store, Google does not restrict emulators on its own Android store. This now leaves Google as the only mobile app store still supporting game emulator apps, as Apple also bans these types of apps.|||
