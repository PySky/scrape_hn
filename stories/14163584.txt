Neil deGrasse Tyson has a few words for those politicians out there denying science. In a four-minute video, which he says contains “what may be the most important words I have ever spoken,” the astrophysicist calls out politicians for denying science.



Tyson partnered with Redglass Pictures to make Science in America and asks people to educate themselves on science, not only to get a better understanding about how things work but also to make themselves more educated voters.

The video highlights those who deny climate change as well as the anti-vaccine movement.

“Recognize what science is and allow it to be what it can and should be in the service of civilization,” Tyson says. “It’s in our hands.”
