PyLucene is a Python extension for accessing Java LuceneTM. Its goal is to allow you to use Lucene's text indexing and searching capabilities from Python. It is API compatible with the latest version of Java Lucene, version 6.5.0 as of April 6th, 2017.

PyLucene is not a Lucene port but a Python wrapper around Java Lucene. PyLucene embeds a Java VM with Lucene into a Python process. The PyLucene Python extension, a Python module called lucene is machine-generated by JCC.

PyLucene is built with JCC, a C++ code generator that makes it possible to call into Java classes from Python via Java's Native Invocation Interface (JNI). Sources for JCC are included with the PyLucene sources.

See here for more information and documentation about PyLucene.

PyLucene is supported on macOS, Linux, Solaris and Windows.

PyLucene requires Python version 2.x (x >= 3.5) or Python 3.x (x >= 3) and Java version 1.8. Building PyLucene requires GNU Make, a recent version of Ant capable of building Java Lucene and a C++ compiler. Use of setuptools is recommended.
