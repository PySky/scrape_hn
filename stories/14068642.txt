This was my first look into the symbolic meaning of the circle rather than just looking at the form.

I looked at the use of circles in religious symbols to see if there were any common themes associated with the form. The most common connotation was protection, followed by sun and time.

To me these meanings are quite well matched.

Other common meanings such as gender, magic or a higher power have less apparent relevance but in these symbols the circle is usually combined with other forms.|||
