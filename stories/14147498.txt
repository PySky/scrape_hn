Hello guys. I was looking for a new programming language with which to start my freelance computer programmer work. Looking around I found Crystal and I love the readable syntax, similar to Ruby. Reading the documentation you read the objectives that led to the creation of this language:

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

I searched among the resources to see if there were sufficient materials that should make it immediately usable (I have to report lack of standard documentation, but actually the language is in alpha stage). For me it was enough to continue.

I think Kemal is the standard the facto web framework for Crystal. Serdar Dogruyol is a kind and helpful person and I love all the community on Gitter (both Crystal and Kemal have a channel).

Actually Crystal don’t work on Windows. So you have to use a Mac or a Linux based system.

For other distros check the official documentation.

Crystal is a compiled language, so it’s helpful to have a tool like Sentry that build your crystal application, watches files, and rebuilds app on file changes.

I chose Atom as IDE, with a couple of packages: Crystal-tools and Crystal.|||
