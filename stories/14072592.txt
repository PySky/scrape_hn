I am supervising a group of students and their task is to build iot sensors for a few different tasks (ie temperature, movement). I want to score them on how securely they design their sensors among other things, since security seems to be such a big problem... hoping that by making this a challenge, it will inspire them to pay more attention to security, and I am not going to warn them beforehand that security will be tested.

How can I test the sensors to see if they are vulnerable to common problems?

Device specifications - all the devices are based on Raspberry Pi 3s and have to connect by Wifi to a router to send some data to a server. I will be able to connect to the same access point as the sensors, but I don't have any knowledge of the code used by the devices.

Has anyone got some ideas how I could test if the devices could be vulnerable to:

Can anyone describe ways for me to probe the security of my students' sensors? Any pentesting frameworks perhaps? Lists of passwords to try? Other tips/tricks?|||
