Verse 1: 

I hear them whispers 

In fact 

And I know it’s ticky tack 

Saying where if earth is Layto 

And is he coming back 

He, she, heard him said, 

That he’s hanging in his head 

Stuck myself in interrogation 

Asking why you declared me dead 

Pre-Chorus: 

One shot to my heart 

(two shots) 

Three shots to my ever-breaking soul 

(bang, bang, bang) 

(underneath) 

Can’t let go of you x2 

You move on like we never happen 

While I got this gaping hole 

Chorus: 

Na-na-na you may act like nothing’s wrong 

Like the same old song 

I know better than the best ay 

Na-na-na-na hey, na-na-na-na 

I got rabbit ears on and a bullet-proof chest 

Hey ay-ay-ay 

You may go on other dates 

But no other will relate 

Or play your’ chords the same way 

Na-na-na-na hey na-na-na-na 

I got rabbit ears on and a bullet-proof chest 

Verse 2: 

You say that your world is a canvas 

You can paint it what you like 

So I colored a horizon 

But for you it turned to night 

This is how you feel when your young and fifteen 

But now my life’s inverted 

I’m at age twenty-three 

(underneath) 

Can’t let go of you x2 

One shot to my heart 

(two-shots) 

Three shots to my ever-breaking soul 

(bang, bang, bang) 

You move on like we never happen 

While I got this gaping hole 

Chorus repeats: 

Bridge: x2 

Careful what you feed your mind 

You need to read the signs 

Took a left at living hers 

And now a right for living mine 

(Underneath) 

A House can’t stand on lies x2 

Chorus x2:
