We released new versions of ansible-os-hardening, ansible-ssh-hardening and ansible-mysql-hardening!

These releases are important to us in multiple ways:

As always, they provide new features and configuration possibilities for you to use! More on that below.

Furthermore we now leverage the full possibilities of TravisCI for the os-hardening, ssh-hardening and mysql-hardening roles. This means that all supported operating systems are now tested and verified online. For that we use customized docker-images that have Ansible pre-installed, as well as our InSpec-tests to verify the roles!

However some operating systems are still missing for mysql-hardening because we’re facing some issues that hopefully will be resolved soon!

We’re always looking for help! Join us on GitHub or Gitter chatroom.

One more important thing to note are the breaking changes.

We removed support for Ansible 1.9 in all three roles, so we can leverage the new modules and functions of Ansible 2.0!

Of course we were productive in fixing bugs, improving the code and adding more features. All with the help of our awesome contributors!

Thanks and have a nice and secure day!|||
