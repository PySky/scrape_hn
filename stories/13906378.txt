We recently announced the winners of Challenge #2, where Udacity students were tasked with building an efficient deep neural network that could steer a car using only camera frames. We saw over 200 submissions from 50 teams all around the world, and we decided to open source the best performing models! Browse the models (and code!) here.

The top scoring network (measured by how close the steering angles generated were to a human) for Challenge #2 was built by the amazing Ilya Edrenkin, a Senior Researcher at Yandex. He generously wrote an iPython Notebook explaining how his neural network was constructed, and I thought it needed to be shared with the world. Enjoy!

Some further notes from Ilya:

And here’s a video of the model in action:|||
