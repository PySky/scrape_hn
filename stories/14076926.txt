One of most beloved aspects of ThinkPads are their keyboards and TrackPoints with physical buttons. While ThinkPads still maintain their iconic TrackPoint mice and physical buttons (barring the unfortunate existence of the x40 series), many fans hold the classic pre-island-style 7-row keyboard in highest esteem. Today, few laptops still use a classic-style keyboard (Alienware is one of the few product lines left that have kept them). As a result, the 7-row classic keyboard on the X62 with its array of status LEDs and additional keys probably looks archaic to your average user, but this is precisely what many ThinkPad fans would be buying this notebook for.

Styling aside, the keyboard has ample travel (1.5mm) and is mostly full-sized. The exception is the outer keys, including the Tab, CapsLock, Back space, and Enter keys. However, this is a small price to pay for the tiny footprint this 12.1-inch laptop occupies: the keyboard is absolutely edge-to-edge as it is. Remember that while a completely full-size keyboard fits on a 16:9 or 16:10 widescreen notebook, the 4:3 ratio means much less space for the keyboard.

If you are already familiar with ThinkPad keyboard layouts, then you know and are used to the location of the Fn and Control keys being reversed in comparison to most laptops, so that won't be an annoyance. The only thing that continues to hamstring our typing efforts after several days is the location of the F1 key where one would normally expect the Esc key to be. We find ourselves accidentally hitting F1 rather than Esc in Chrome and bringing up the Help menu multiple times per day.

Another concession of a keyboard from 2007 would the absence of backlighting—as you’d of course expect. However, if you press the Fn and PgUp keys, you’ll be greeted with another of the X62’s charms: the ThinkLight. Since 2005, most ThinkPads have come equipt with this small downward-facing light that illuminates the keys from above. It has a distinctly different effect from what has now become the “traditional” backlight, but it still lights up enough of the keyboard that you won’t have a problem finding the keys.

Occasional layout annoyances aside, the haptics of the keyboard are absolutely stellar: there is zero flex of the deck even under heavy pressure. As a result of the travel, stability, and action, the overall keyboard experience is quite enjoyable.

Beyond the keyboard, the first thing most users will probably notice is the lack of a touchpad. Removed to save space on this sub-notebook, most ThinkPad aficionados wouldn't be caught dead using a TrackPad anyway. For the uninitiated, one benefit of the TrackPoint is that it allows the user to use the mouse while keeping their hands on the home-row keys, improving productivity. If you absolutely hate TrackPoint mice, then the X62 will probably be a non-starter for you. We found that, despite the age, the TrackPoint on our unit was smooth and precise in its action. The physical clickers themselves are as smooth and satisfying to use as those on a new ThinkPad and show no signs of wear.|||
