Turbodbc is a Python module to access relational databases via the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface. In addition to complying with the Python Database API Specification 2.0, turbodbc offers built-in NumPy support. Donâ€™t wait minutes for your results, just blink.

Slightly longer answer: turbodbc is faster, much faster if you want to work with NumPy.

Medium-length answer: I have tested turbodbc and pyodbc (probably the most popular Python ODBC module) with various databases (Exasol, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and corresponding ODBC drivers. I found turbodbc to be consistently faster.

For retrieving result sets, I found speedups between 1.5 and 7 retrieving plain Python objects. For inserting data, I found speedups of up to 100.

Is this completely scientific? Not at all. I have not told you about which hardware I used, which operating systems, drivers, database versions, network bandwidth, database layout, SQL queries, what is measured, and how I performed was measured.

All I can tell you is that if I exchange pyodbc with turbodbc, my benchmarks took less time, often approaching one (reading) or two (writing) orders of magnitude. Give it a spin for yourself, and tell me if you liked it.|||
