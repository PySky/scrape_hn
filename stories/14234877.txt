Worldwide, 60% of all the websites are built with WordPress. Clearly, WordPress is the most popular content management system. This makes it a good fit for the backend systems of native mobile apps, especially if you already have a WordPress website and you’d like to deliver a native experience to your users, by converting it into a native app.

In addition to that, with the launch of WordPress 4.7.1, that includes built-in support for its REST API, WordPress became the most suitable option for those who are looking into launching their own native mobile apps quickly and cheaply. This bold move made by WordPress proves that its creators want their platform to be used in this manner.

We, at iOS App Templates, already pursued this approach and came up with a native app template that turns your WordPress website into an iOS native app. This article describes a bunch of reasons why WordPress is a good fit to power your mobile app’s backend.

Let’s face it. Almost everyone interested in building a mobile app has at least owned/created one website in the past. And they most likely used WordPress. Given that a huge amount of people are already familiar with the platform, this represents a key advantage to WordPress branding itself as a backend platform for native apps.

Almost all the developers and tech entrepreneurs are used to how WordPress is installed, how the plugins work, how the themes can be switched, etc. Since all these elements are already created for you (and most of them are free), why would you waste time and money on reinventing the wheel?

The fact that you are already familiar with the platform your app will be using represents a major business advantage to your venture. It will dramatically increase productivity since everyone will know how to execute things.

Even if you are not familiar yourself with the platform, it’s really easy to find WordPress developers out there. As opposed to using other platforms (or creating one from scratch), finding developers who know WordPress is really easy. Also, given that WordPress is so well-known by the majority of developers, the prices for any WordPress tasks are usually very cheap.

As we mentioned earlier, 60% of the websites are built on top of WordPress. This essentially means that WordPress can accommodate 60% of all the business needs in the Internet industry. If this holds true for websites, it most likely holds true for native mobile apps as well. The likelihood that WordPress will be a good fit for your app idea is really high.

The power of WordPress comes from the large variety of plugins. You can turn your WordPress site into pretty much any business case you want by installing appropriate plugins and themes. WordPress is being used for news reading, shopping/e-commerce websites, travel websites, event websites, etc. And all of this is possible through the flexibility provided by the WordPress plugins. Those plugins and themes are so powerful that you can use WordPress for any mobile app idea you might have.

This represents a major advantage. The more people are familiar with WordPress, the better the platform gets. Right now, WordPress is still in early stages when it comes to its capability of supporting native mobile apps, but given the widespread of developers working with WordPress on a daily basis, things are definitely heading in the right direction.

Additionally, the future of WordPress as a backend platform for native mobile apps looks really promising, after the decision of introducing the REST API plugin as part of the official WordPress release. This is proof that its creators are open to this new use case and are willing to invest into this direction as well. In this manner, the community is basically encouraged to pursue this approach, so many more awesome features will most likely follow soon.|||
