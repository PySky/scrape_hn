This week we’ve released a preview of the next update to Visual Studio. It has all of the improvements that were released recently in VS 2017 Update 1, and also the earliest previews of VS 2017 Update 2.

For Python support, probably our most significant update is that we are now available in all fourteen languages that Visual Studio ships with.

We’re really excited to be making our tooling available to more people all around the world.

While Python itself is predominantly English, many developers are able to get by without fluency. The same also applies for Visual Studio, but it is a much more pleasant experience to have a familiar interface.

Since we often display information coming from Python itself or others who are not fully localized, you will still see English from time to time.

Our goal is to ensure that everything we can translate into your language will be translated, and that those translations are correct and helpful.

Do you use or can you read any of Visual Studio’s languages? Here’s how you can help us out:

After installing the update, choose Modify, bring up the Language Packs tab, and select any languages you can read. Then, inside Visual Studio, you can use the International Settings options to switch to whichever language you would like. This will translate all of Visual Studio, even if you are not using that language for Windows.

Then, as you use the product, please report any translation issues you spot at this github issue. The best reports will include:

We will forward these reports to our localization team to assess and fix. Our plan is to be declared fully stable for this upcoming update, which means we need to find all the problems we can during this preview. Your help is really appreciated.

Thanks for using Visual Studio!|||
