The touchpad on my new Macbook is way too big to be useful. For example, Chome and Sketch will randomly be zoomed in/out just because my left thumb inattentionally rested on the touchpad.

When I googled, I found that I'm not alone.

The trackpad is too big. This sounds odd, but itâ€™s unnecessarily large. The size leads occasional palm rejection issues, which means the mouse occasionally jumps around and even accidental clicks from my palm occasionally occur.

The touchpad can still sensor my touch even with the post-it on. But it seems the input signal is kind of weakened so even with my left thumb on, I can still do normal moving and scrolling without triggering the zoom.|||
