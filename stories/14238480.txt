It’s been a month since I launched my online course on Udemy and it’s exceeding my expectations! Here’s how I got to the top of the heap.

This updates my last article, “The Online Tech Teaching Hustle w/ Udemy” which I wrote approximately two weeks after launching.

Here are the results when I search for . My course has the top spot with the “Bestselling” tag.

I honestly didn’t expect this, but I worked smart and my diligence paid off.

Before I get into the marketing tricks that I used to get here, I want to remind potential instructors to post good shit.

Quora: What is the best way to get traffic on your blog? SEO, SMM, PR, etc?

And that’s just what I did. I am proud of my course! It has added real value to the lives of real people.

I’ll explain how I got to the top of the list shortly, but first, I need some help with my next course about WebGL and Unity! Would you join my early access team to help me refine some lectures?

If you’re an instructor, know that the search results screen is where you should invest serious time.

Let’s take a look at some things in the listing

It took me five minutes to crop and create this image, but I’ll guess that Google spent a 500K developing the Chrome logo — conducting dozens of A/B tests. It has bright colors and lines directed inward to draw your attention.

The image looks uglier and less refined than the other course images, but I think the attention grabbing nature is what’s really important here.

Potential students will search for a couple of things

Every single one of those terms is embedded in the title, subtitle, and description.

I experimented with Udemy’s auto-complete when typing some of these terms to see exactly what potential students would be searching for.

I also added the term “2017” to signal that this material is current. And “Beginner to Expert” to signify that this will help a wide audience including beginners and professionals!

I am offering more content and (I think) a better class than the other offerings on the topic. If I was a student, I’d rather spend the bucks to get the right training than waste my time with a cut rate class.

And for the bargain hunters? There’s coupon links all over the web, just like this.

Most importantly, I followed the “post good shit” method (see above). But I also recruited some of my webdev friends to take the class early and leave their honest feedback. I did this with personal messages on Facebook.

For every 30m of video I have a 5 second interlude asking people to leave a review. Icing on the cake? I’ll donate $10 to Mission Bit for each of the first fifty written reviews.

I offered a $19 coupon above, but since you read this far here’s a $10 coupon for my devtools class. It’s the lowest price I’ll ever offer, and ends May 5.

This one, I can’t control directly. I think the tag popped up about three weeks after launch. I was convinced that I wouldn’t get it, because I did not post free coupons online and my student numbers were lower than competing courses.

Apparently, the rate of sales is what’s key here, and not free users! Horray!

There are many reasons free students are not ideal, but I’ll write about that in a later article. Make sure to follow me on Medium to get the scoop.

There are three other items that make my course stand out.

That’s how I used some smarts to build a great course listing and get to the top of the pack!

Please 💚 if you learned something new today. It gives lots of motivation to keep writing articles like this! And don’t forget about the advisory board for my WebGL class.|||
