To make it simple, machine learning allows you to build an algorithm (recipe) that doesn’t have to be explicitly defined — is it possible? Yes, everything in this algorithm (recipe) is learned from your data — each condition or new step is based on your data. As a result of learning you get an algorithm, but to be more precise, you obtain a model. This model has some knowledge about your data and this model can serve responses for you based on input data.

There will be always some kind of response from model, because otherwise it will be useless. Response can be in different formats — it can be numbers, images, audio, or response can be the internal structure of the model which can bring us some insights. Based on the response you can take actions.

Usually, there are two stages in machine learning model life:

You cannot omit learning step for your model, because otherwise it will produce some random responses. However, sometimes you can buy access to already learned model, which you can use for predictions (for example clarifai, algorithmia).

There are many ways you can categorize machine learning algorithms, one of them depends on data available for learning:|||

Machine Learning is a hot topic nowadays. It is a kind of a buzz word everyone is trying to use to look smarter. I asked my friend about type of algorithm his company is using for classification and…
