I’m glad there was no smartphone when I was growing up

 Or there would be a whole lot more embarrassing records of me

 Not that there isn’t enough already

 But anymore and I won’t even be able to show my face

 I know what you’re thinking: he’s a “homebody” anyway!

 But that’s a story for another day

 For now, let’s focus on what we do to remember

 The things that happened, the things we try to keep

 And even the things we try so hard to forget, yet can’t

 It’s the past, the bell that tolls in our metaphysical body,

 Like a bullhorn with a mild case of Alzheimer, sometimes, it rants

 Most of images and words are fragments

 Like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle trying to fit each other

 And although a complete story is often an impossibility,

 Beauty lies in the fact that our soul continues to yearn for the full picture.

This is why we find ourselves at odds

 with our own desire to record

 Every moment and every thought

 With every piece of technology available to us

 From cave walls

 to skin of animals,

 pen and paper, typewriter and cameras

 Now we combined everything into one smartphone

 Which we often use for doing anything but “smart” and “phone.”

It’s a rather natural workflow now-a-day

 Snap the picture of whatever

 and share it on multiple social networks right away

 Then we wait

 For the awesome internet karma to roll in

 All the likes and comments

 make us feel significant,

 even if it’s just for a little bit.

And just like that, our past has become

 bits and pixels

 Digitized and saved to different channels

 But like the fear of photography

 as a destructive force against traditional arts

 The “pen of nature” is simply another medium, a part

 of a giant vessel we use to carry our past to the future

 But the tricky thing about the past

 is that you can never be sure

 It’s like a charcoal

 you thought has been out long ago

 Then a quick wind fans it into flame

 which can burn down an entire house of emotional stability.

So tell me:

 How would one record the stark and frisky morning in Winter?

 Or a depression like a corpse we dig up one time or another

 Or that ache we get,

 slow and ambivalent like a leaf floating to us on an Autumn river

 Or how we try to collect all those feelings

 in hope to make our past rhymes

 for some times, then some others

 Our past lingers

 not in images, videos or any other medium we know

 But more like a knot slowly tightening our soul

 So we feel, we remember and we continue to be.

So let us not worry

 about the future of our past

 For however long our lives will last

 We will remember

 With all the instruments of God

 We will remember.|||
