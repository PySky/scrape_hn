Everyone knows about the United Airlines recent accident with overbooking. But how exactly is calculated the optimal number of people that united airlines should overbook? In this video, we will try to analyze an algorithm that is used in Machine learning in order to forecast future results in a model.

Let’s think like a company. Εverything started from the simple observation that a percentage of people don’t even show up for their flight and most of these tickets don’t even get refunded. Every empty seat costs for the company, especially if you multiply this small number with the number of flights every day. 

So a simple idea is to just overbook every flight for the average of 2 or 3 people and everything will be fine, right? No, this is a naive approach that takes into consideration only the average number of missing people from every flight. The goal here is to create a specially designed algorithm that can predict with extremely high accuracy this phenomenon, in order to avoid this event. The analysis coming up. First of all, I want to clarify that of course I don’t know the exact algorithm that is used by United Airlines in order to predict these numbers, however here we will analyse the technology that is used in computer science in order to create this algorithm that can predict very accurately future results based on existing databases.









Many of you have already guessed that we are talking about Machine Learning. The technology that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is a very interesting concept that enables Airlines to use already existing data in order to forecast the future for better overbooking practices.

 Let’s try to create a very simple example with only one parameter. For example, we can assume that only the ticket price determines if a person will show up for his flight. It is safe to say that if your airplane seat costs 1000$, it is more likely to not miss your flight than if it is a $100 ticket. So it is safe to say that the curve of people who don't show up for their flight that correlates with the ticket price is something like this. So if we have this Data from previous flights, we can create this function P = f(M). In this way, we will have a function that can calculate approximately how many people will attend the flight. This is something that can be used but this algorithm can be made more intelligent by using more and more features. For example, it can get more personalized by using the History of the passenger. This will create a 3-dimensional function that will show how many seats you should overbook depending on two features. The list goes on and on by using more and more features, in order to create a more accurate forecast. 

Don’t forget that if you want to learn programming from scratch or learn more things about machine learning and how to actually train a model that will forecast things in the future, subscribe because it is completely free and will keep you updated for the next videos!

Of course, I should note that I don’t agree with this way of thinking and more specifically with this event. I just analyze it from a scientific point of view in order to give you a more technical perspective of this situation.

And as always, keep coding guys!
