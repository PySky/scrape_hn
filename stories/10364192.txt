This is intended to be a repository for all kinds of Perl 6 examples.

All examples should work for any full implementation of Perl 6.

If an example needs an implementation specific version then it should end in .implementation. For example, if you are making an example that only works on Rakudo, it should end in .rakudo.

If you want to contribute, just ask! The quicker choice is to use IRC: join on and you'll be welcome.

Please use POD (mostly this template https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples/blob/master/doc/example-template.pl) when adding a new example.

Since you have a commit-bit (if not then talk to the folks at #perl6 on irc.freenode.net) feel free to commit your changes to the main repository. No need to submit a pull request!

To run all examples and tests, a number of modules need to be installed.

These are listed in .

They can be installed via or :

To run most examples (all examples excluding those which take a very long time or are memory hogs) one can use the script in the directory:

or simply via the target of the Makefle:

If one wishes to run the examples for a given category, then one can simply use the option specifying the desired category's directory name. For example, to run the examples for the category, use the following:

or you can run the script in the base directory:

After the pages have been generated, you can view them on your local computer by starting the included program:

You can then view the examples documentation by pointing your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
