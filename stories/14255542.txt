Huawei is well known for taking several models of smartphones from all ranges, we already attended the presentation of the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus in the high range or its Lite version in the mid-range.

However, the Chinese manufacturer does not stand still, as they still have to cover part of the market.

Huawei opened last year the Nova family with two mid-range phones, which four months ago began receiving Android Nougat.

This year we will see their successors, the Huawei Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus, which will be presented on May 26, but before they have had to go through TENAA, where they have been seen with a double camera in the back.

Both the Huawei Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus will have, as usual, a unibody aluminum body. In the images, it appears in pink gold color and with its fingerprint sensor in the back.

As for the front of the phone, looks very similar to the previous generation, maintaining edges of a thickness more or less normal.

As for specifications, in TENAA are not revealed, but according to some rumors could take the processor Snapdragon 660, while others speak of the Kirin 660.

Whichever processor you choose, you would have 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. In the photographic section would have a double rear camera of 12 MP and a front of 8 MP.

The batteries would be 3,000 and 3,300 mAh for Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus, respectively.

At the moment anything that is not the design that appears in the images and the frequency bands is unknown, so any rumor will be confirmed or denied on May 26, the date on which these two phones are presented.

As always, we recommend being cautious with these rumors.|||
