NSA/Fuzzbunch deployment for kali linux - Intructions. This version was designed to work under kali linux (to enhance our personal pentesting tools) using wine (32bits version) since Fuzzbunch uses python26 and WindowsXP. This is very useful if you want to mix it with your Empire/Metasploit arsenal.

This particular version of Fuzzbunch has some personal fixes that I found over the internet:

I read a lot of different papers on how to install and run this on WindowsXP and a few running on Unix, none of them on Kali (Maybe there are a bunch, but I didn't do much research to be honest). All of the they needed to fix some files, move folders, or download files from different websites, I just wanted to make it simple, quick and accessible for everyone only by typing a few bash commands and a git clone!

After you install everything you can use fuzzbunch doing the following:

if someone wants to collaborate making a script to automatize everything, please do a pull request!

Since fuzzbunch uses windows32 libraries, we are going to setup our own wine32 environment, also this will prevent to break any wine application that you are already using.

That will get you something like this:

That should get us C:\fuzzbunch-debian\windows> prompt. Run fuzzbunch (fb.py)

That's it, Fuzzbunch it's up and running! Use it by your own responsability and for internal and authorized only purposes!

Q: When I type on fuzzbunch it looks all screw-up. What's Going on? Did I do something wrong?

A: FIXED by @Alamot, Thanks! Make sure you have the HEAD version of this git. It was fixed at commit @655eae5.|||
