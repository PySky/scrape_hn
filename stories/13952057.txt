Slow websites are a huge pet peeve of mine. When it comes to making websites faster… let’s just say I can become a little obsessed at times.

If you’re looking to increase the speed of your website, you’ve come to the right place! I’m going recommend two WordPress speed-up plugins, go through their installation and their recommended settings. The hope is that your website will load a couple of seconds faster.

Our website is very optimized for speed but just for fun, I followed along with the steps I provided in this blog and was still able to squeeze out a 20% increase.

First of all, let’s take a benchmark of where your website is at currently.

Please visit https://tools.pingdom.com, paste your URL in the box and select the city closest to you in the dropdown box.

I did 20 times (don’t judge I like data and accuracy) for https://neumarkets.com and the median load time was 1.95 seconds. It’s really important to record the load time as you’ll need it for comparison later on.

Oh, and you can copy the URL because it saves your test results as well. It’s always nice to revisit later and do a side-by-side comparison later on – or, to send a colleague the before and after results.

Now that you have some benchmarks in place, let’s start speeding up your WordPress site! I’ll be using the free versions of both recommended plugins in this post.

The first recommended plugin is called WP Smush. This plugin compresses all of the images in your media library. The free version of this plugin allows 50 images to be compressed at once.

To install this plugin go to your WordPress Dashboard then Plugins > Add New.

In the search box type “WP Smush”, then click Install Now when it appears in the search result.

Once it is done installing the button will refresh to Activate… click it. Then you’ll be brought to the plugin settings page. Start Smushing!

The plugin shows you the total savings from all of the image compression that’s happening. Yey stats!

The next plugin we’re going to use is called W3 Total Cache.

This plugin caches the pages and images on your website to make them load faster. It also minifies (makes them smaller) CSS, Javascript and HTML files.

Again, to install the plugin go to your WordPress Dashboard Plugins > Add New. In the search bar type “W3 Total Cache” then click “Install Now” and then Activate when it finishes.

Please use caution when using this plugin, as features (that are normally good) such as minify can end up breaking the website. Please proceed with minification at your own risk.

If you do have an issue and aren’t able to login to WordPress, please login to your server via FTP and disable the plugin (wp_content > plugins > w3-total-cache) by renaming it; just add a dash in front of the plugin name such as: -w3-total-cache.

You’ll notice that after you install the plugin you’ll be brought back to the main plugins page and there’ll be a new item on the WordPress sidebar called Performance.

Please ensure the debug settings are turned off as the debug settings will actually cause your site to slow down!

You’re done! Let’s check how you did 🙂

Visit https://tools.pingdom.com in your browser once get your post-optimization benchmark. I took 20 samples (because I’m me) and this time the median page load time was 1.575 seconds. This was a 0.375-second improvement or 19.23% which is amazing!

Please let us know how you did so we can add some cool charts and graphs to this blog in the future!|||
