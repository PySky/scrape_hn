We have created Humaniq to implement two big ideas: to open access to modern financial services for 2 billion unbanked people, and to allow vetted partners to participate in building ‘win-win’ products and services for the Humaniq community that can provide revenue and services for all the stakeholders.

According to Metcalfe’s law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users.

Humaniq is about ‘Profit with a Purpose’, also known as humanitarian capitalism. We create win-wins for all stakeholders in the spectrum. This is an opportunity not only to improve the quality of life in emerging economies for some of the world’s poorest people, but it’s also an opportunity for entrepreneurs who want to build -non or profitable services such as a direct donation platform, or perhaps a P2P lending addon that might help you achieve not only a ROI on your investment, but also help empower and improve the lives of others who have never had opportunities with traditional financial services before and who currently pay exorbitant interest rates of between 35 and 80 percent to loan sharks as traditional banks won’t help them. You’ll feel good about your investment knowing that both parties are profiting from the exchange.|||
