For example, we have run live payroll for the 500 employees for a particular month for the selected payroll area. After the live run, there need to change some master data for 25 employees and re-run payroll and it's time-consuming to re-run payroll for all 500 employees. So Matchcode W is the solution for this problem.

 



If we select Matchcode W and run payroll, the system will only process the 25 employees whose data was changed and other will not be processed for the second time as there is no change in the master data.It will pick up the employees based on the changed date in the earliest MD Change in SAP Infotype 0003.

Following are the steps to run SAP Payroll Matchcode W:

Step 1: Go to the payroll driver using the "SAP Easy Access Menu" navigation path SAP Menu→Human Resources →Payroll or T-Code: PC00_MXX_CALC -  where XX is Molga value of the country.

 

 

 Step 2: In step 2 click on "Search helps" button.

 



Step 4: An additional screen is displayed which can be used to further restrict the selection of employees with Master Data change (10 from our above example). This screen is optional and can be bypassed.
