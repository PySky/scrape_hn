Subshard is an attempt to make a better 'Tor browser' - based on Chrome instead of Firefox, and using a client-server model instead of a 'thick client'.

Subshard has two parts: The client script (which launches and controls Chrome for you) and , a server component where Chrome tunnels all traffic.

When you launch subshard, a separate chrome instance starts which is bound to a subshard server. All traffic goes through your server, proxy style.

You configure which domains go to Tor and which URLs go to the open internet. You can configure domains to be blocked, such as ad domains or websites which can identify you (prevent yourself from absent-mindedly logging into facebook).

The Tor browser is an easy target for browser exploits. Such approaches are known and effective attack vectors by modern adversaries.

Please see our instructions on installing the server.

Windows: Unfortunately, I dont have packaging for Windows. Please see here for some basic instructions for manually getting it working. If you know windows, please help me get it packaged.

OSX/Debian: Setting up a client on your machine should be as trivial as installing a package for your OS, doing two configuration steps for your first run, and then using it! Make sure you have Chrome stable already installed, and please follow our instructions for your platform.
