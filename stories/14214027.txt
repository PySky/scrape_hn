Supporting authentic conversations on our platform and helping build a more informed, civically engaged community are important to us. But we also know that some groups and individuals have attempted to misuse Facebook in efforts to spread misinformation or to manipulate discussions. Our dedicated teams work tirelessly to defend against these actions.

Given the increasing role that Facebook plays in fostering discussions and the exchange of ideas, we wanted to share what we are doing to help ensure our community remains a safe and secure environment for authentic communication. For more information on how Facebook is helping to protect against the amplification of misinformation, read our whitepaper: “ Information Operations and Facebook .”

Alex Stamos is the Chief Security Officer at Facebook.|||
