After being closed for more than two years for important repairs and restoration, The New York Public Library’s historic Rose Main Reading Room and Bill Blass Public Catalog Room reopens to the public this morning at 10 a.m.

“The Library has eagerly anticipated the reopening of these glorious rooms, architectural gems which for over 100 years have been home to scholars, writers, students, and all members of the public who want to access our renowned research collections, learn, and create,” said NYPL President Tony Marx, who led the opening ceremony this morning.

The rooms are now open during regular library hours; daily tours of the Schwarzman Building at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. include both spaces, which are designated for research and quiet study. Don't miss the final days of the exhibition Preserving a Masterpiece: From Soaring Ceilings to Subterranean Storage, open through October 9, which details the restoration of this iconic room.
