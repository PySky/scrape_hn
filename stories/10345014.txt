DFEs can now be taught to speak almost any language.

MaxSkins generates Appache Thrift wrappers for SLiC interfaces (basic static, advanced static and dynamic) for various programming languages. MaxSkins enable easy and seamless access to the DFEs from C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa and Delphi.

It is recomended to use Docker image with all pre-installed dependencies. Find more about Docker at https://www.docker.com.

Find more about volumes at https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes.

The examples for the maxskins utility usage are located in the examples directory. For each example there is a README.md file. All .max files are pre-compiled with the MaxCompiler v2014.2.

Script h2thrift generates Appache Thrift wrappers for any C header file thus allowing the use of functions implemented in C in various programming languages.

It generates a Appache Thrift IDL file and a C++ server implementation from the given header file. The IDL file can then be used to generate Appache Thrift wrappers for various programming languages:

Now all you need is to run a server and connect your program with it using Appache Thrift.
