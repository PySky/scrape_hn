Just 10 days after confirming that liquid water has been found on Mars, the US space agency revealed a landmark discovery the amazing dwarf-planet has both ice and a 'gorgeous' blue sky.

A Nasa spokesman said: "New Horizons has detected numerous small, exposed regions of water ice on Pluto.

"The discovery was made from data collected by the Ralph spectral composition mapper on New Horizons."

There has been repeated speculation Pluto may have a liquid sea under its surface, and confirmation of water ice on the surface adds to this theory.

Amazingly, much of the frozen ice has been found in a deep crack running from an interesting crater on Pluto first highlighted to Nasa by Express.co.uk as a potentially interesting feature back in July when images first beamed back.

At the time New Horizons planetary scientist David Grinspoon said it could be an eroded asteroid or comet impact crater and tectonic lines, hinting that the dwarf planet may still be geologically active.|||

NASA has discovered frozen water and earth-like blue skies on Pluto in another historic development in the search for extraterrestrial life.
