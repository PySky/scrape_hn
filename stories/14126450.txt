Android Wear 2.0 has been officially released last year with Developer Preview but the public release happened only last February. OEMs were quick to roll out OTA updates and the new OS version has given most of these smartwatches more exciting functions and useful features. We’re expecting that unlike last year when smartwatch sales were declining, smartwatch sales will improve. As we already know this update will come with Google AI assistance with it.

Here are all the watches to get Android Wear 2.0 update:

LG G Watch R and Watch Urbane will both start updating to Android Wear 2.0 this week, with the Watch Urbane 2nd edition following suit in the beginning of May.

The new features in this update include features like Google fit, Android Pay and LTE connection. The above listed devices can get the update anytime soon.
