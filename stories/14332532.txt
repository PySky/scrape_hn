One of the most popular Super Sports cars of the last decade has been the Audi R8! For 2017 Audi has completely redesigned the R8 into what may be the best and most useable Supercar on the market today!

On this episode of the Targa Trophy Ride Check, we test the day to day functionality and extreme performance of the new R8 throughout the concrete jungle of Downtown Los Angeles and some of the most EPIC roads in all of the United States to find out just how good this new R8 really is. Our goal, to answer the ultimate question â€“ should you consider adding one to your stable if you have the means?

Watch and find out for yourself!|||
