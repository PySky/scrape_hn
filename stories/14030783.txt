Verse is a RESTful API that checks the latest version of your favourite open source project and simplifies the whole process to one HTTP request. Just like that.

You can either choose one of the available projects or provide a GitHub repository and use it as the source of released versions.

Feel free to visit GitHub for more information, browse through API docs or play with the browsable API.|||
