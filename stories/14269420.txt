Clients want us to deliver online experiences that are competitive with Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google and other top-tier tech companies because that's what consumers demand. This has created a war for unlike anything I've seen in my career. While it must be fought, it can never be won because the rules are not what they seem.

Our clients want and native experiences that look, feel, and perform like they were built by Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. (and the back ends to support them). Each of these companies with very specific programming languages and frameworks.

The problem is, if you're good enough to work for us, you're good enough to work for them, or anyone else for that matter. And while we have done our best to build a yellow brick road to our company, the yellow brick road that leads to top-tier tech actually has a metaphoric Emerald City at its end.|||
