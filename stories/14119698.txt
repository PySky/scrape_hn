Kubernetes is a big project with many contributors. Unfortunately, to contribute the bootstrap for compiling and testing the code with an actual     up is not easy.  The documentation is complex, not always working, and somewhat outdated. Moreover, it does not give all the details for you to start from zero into a working local     with code, with an example of a source file change and compile and run.  This is exactly what we are going to do here!

We have promised to start from zero, right? So, we are going to create a new, clean   and run it in this first step.

Figure 1: This is what your VM configuration should look like- pay special attention to be sure you have enough memory.

We are going to install:

ssh to your VM and then install GCC, Make, socat, and git:

In this step, we are going to clone the Git Kubernetes source code and add it to    . We are going to use    so that we do not fetch the whole history, only the latest revision.

This is easy as they have a utility called

The output should be:

Open a new shell to your VM and cd to your Kubernetes source directory in    and test it:

We are going to change an entry point in     add a log line to it and see that we see it in logs:

Stop your local cluster and restart it with

Now tail API server log line and you will see this line:

The documentation for starting up a local Kubernetes cluster from scratch then doing a source code update and testing it is somewhat lacking or incomprehensible.  We have just followed a few simple steps and fetched a Kubernetes cluster and compiled and changed its API server, then viewed our change.|||

This tutorial will guide you through running, changing the source code, and testing a local Kubernetes platform cluster from square one using a new VM.
