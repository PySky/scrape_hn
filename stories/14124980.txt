So many good demos to watch from the Revision demo-party this year, so hereâ€™s another post. ðŸ˜‰

This demo is called Overdrive 2 and was developed by Titan. It was made for SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive.

It sports excellent music, great graphics and awesome effects. It is, just like the one for the Amstrad I wrote about earlier today, a must see.

Now Iâ€™m counting down the time to the Amiga Demo Competition at Revisionâ€¦ Hope itâ€™ll be just as great as all of the demos weâ€™ve seen so far. ðŸ™‚|||
