Full Version Can Be Found here Sandman will remind you to take a rest and that you can always come back to the work tomorrow. A sleep cycle is a 90-minute chunk of time where your body transitions through various phases of sleep — all the way down to deep REM sleep — then back again. Some health experts believe that these 90-minute sleep cycles are the key to restful sleep. They recommend trying to sleep exactly 7.5 hours — or even 9 hours, if you have the time. Based on the time you need to wake up — and assuming it will take you 15 minutes to fall asleep — Sandman will notify you throughout the evening at specific times when you could go to sleep and maximize your number of full sleep cycles.
