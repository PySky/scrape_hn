The economical cost to do what you want in your life is relatively nothing. You can wake up today and be whoever you want to be. You see, there’s this thing called the internet. It has completely gotten rid of any barriers and excuses people come up with in their head about not making their vision a reality. All these justifications are nonsense and now the internet is here to smoke you out of your bullshit, because we live in the most privileged time in history and there’s no better time to start.

And the older I get, every time I think about this it’s a total mind fuck, because it’s true. Each one of us literally has the power to reach the world at our fingertips. This wasn’t the case a decade ago. Instead of producing & creating content that moves people or executing on what you love, we follow celebrities or chase careers that were once deemed to be ultra respected and admired.

I’ve been living bicoastal for three years between two of the greatest cities on planet earth with no limitations, splurging on whatever I want, and a work schedule that would make Kim Kardashian jealous and I can tell you from experience, that doing what you love is far better than stuff or material things. It just is. As glamorous as that lifestyle may sound, if I can’t get up everyday and be honest with myself about if I love what I’m doing with my time, those “things” do very little in increasing my own happiness.

One last thing, because I’m not sure if you know this or not, but we’re all going to be dead soon. If that isn’t enough motivation to try and take a risk, I’m not sure what is.|||
