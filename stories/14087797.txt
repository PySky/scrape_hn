You start out shit overall, but with some foundation value, someone notices you, over time you refine your offering and make something millions of people love.

I love metal music, I also like startups. Currently building one and having read many a books on ‘successful’ ones there are some striking similarities between the path a metal band takes and that in which a startup does on this yellow brick road to ‘success’.

For fun Twitter will be the startup and Bring Me The Horizon (BMTH) the metal band.

The crux of it all is that you start out with a group of people and make something that overall, is pretty shit. Be it the music or product you make, it is generally subpar. But that is OK because it is your first attempt.

Twitter in the early days not only couldn’t stay live it was built with a technical scaffolding of chopsticks. Similar BMTH started out making pretty god awful sounding music, too much deathcore influence and questionable rhythm progressions.

Despite the subpar first showing to the world, there is always some foundational value that is evident. It isn’t much but it is enough to get some early users, or fans. People start using your product or come to your shows. But you have to hustle like hell at every chance to keep it going!

Twitters early foundational value was the speed in which it could spread information. A tweet was more powerful at alerting people about a fire on the corner of 42nd and 5th then any news publications. But on the inside there was a founder being booted, technical dramas and failed marketing growth events.

Likewise BMTH in the early days had an amazing vocalist Oli, and radical drummer Matt. Problem is they hadn’t quite yet found their sound. But they had managed to sign with a local label and started hustling to get on tour. They even made fake email accounts to get shows booked, strong hustle!!!

If you have something great to offer the world someone will see it. Nothing starts out great but if there is something to see someone will be cunning enough to spot it. In startup land this is your typical seed or angel investor and for music record labels. If startups get funded, bands get signed or distributions rights bought.

Twitter was originally kept alive by Ev (Evan Williams) but when they deciding to raise a real round there was plenty of funds lining up (cough, USV, cough).

Likewise BMTH signed with a smaller label early on, but after killing it live on tour and building a legion of dedicated fans bigger labels started paying attention. (fun fact, the bands tour manager was Oli’s mum for almost 5 years).

This is where good becomes great. A startup will constantly be in a cycle of refining, validating and shipping new products or features. Every cycle or version shipped will add some small value that will eventually amass to something great!

Likewise a band will record new albums, experiment with new sounds, add members, new elements and eventually find a unique sound that is flipping amazing!

Both of these usually take years, 6+ easily. In comparison to their first showings to the world it will be like night and day but it would not have been achieved without first putting out shit and refining.

Twitter seemed to hit it’s sweet spot when it booted Ev (sad) and handed the reins back to Jack. BMTH hit this when it parted ways with guitarist Curtis Ward and added keyboardist Fish.

Both a startup and band will go through rough early days, periods of unknowns, constant refining of the end product, team changes, team additions, outside help and hopefully have it in them to emerge the other side a success.

BMTH was listened to in the creating of this post.|||
