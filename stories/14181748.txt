A highly studied and compact short going from The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk to Kelly Johnson to Chuck Yeager and Bob Hoover, to finally getting the action payoff of SR-71 Blackbird action.

This piece is an homage and tribute to Aviation. It is dangerous. It is heroic.

The desired payoff would be akin to the scope of what James Cameron ascribes to - an immersive film. I've had the good fortune to see several pictures on 70MM IMAX and I like to think I know what to reach for after all these years.

While it might be retired, I'd love to at least simulate what it might have been like to be in that plane at the edge of the world on the big screen. How about you?|||
