Athenz is a set of services and libraries supporting role-based authorization (RBAC) for provisioning and configuration (centralized authorization) use cases as well as serving/runtime (decentralized authorization) use cases. Athenz authorization system utilizes two types of tokens: Principal Tokens (N-Tokens) and RoleTokens (Z-Tokens). The name "Athenz" is derived from "Auth" and the 'N' and 'Z' tokens.

Athenz provides both the functionality of a centralized system and a certificate and IP-based distributed system to handle on-box enforcement.

You get the following advantages using Athenz:

More importantly, we want engineers to use Athenz and not build their own role-based access control systems that have no central store and often rely on network ACLs and manual updating.|||
