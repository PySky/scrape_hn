 Given a string and a pattern containing wildcard characters i.e. and , where can match to any single character in input string and can match to any number of characters including zero characters, design an efficient algorithm to find if the pattern matches with the complete input string or not.



The idea is to usehere. If we carefully analyze the problem, we can see that it can easily be further divided into sub-problems. Letâ€™s take top-bottom approach to solve this problem.

For a given and ,

Special care has to be taken to handle base conditions:

Below is top-down DP solution in C++ using memoization â€“



 The time complexity of above solution is and auxiliary space used by the program is .
