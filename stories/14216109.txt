Both are brilliantly designed bridges. Because they have been around a while, we may forget to marvel at their brilliance, but not me.

First a cable-stayed bridge (because I love them the most)

A perfectly vertical tower is strong and stable because gravity works with it.

Once you have a strong, stable tower, it can take some of the weight of the span through the cables.

It’s almost as good as having a ‘skyhook’.

Cable-stayed bridges, in their simplest form, are based on one tower

There are many variations of design using the cable-stayed principle. The tower can slope, it can have cables on one or both sides, for example. Here are some beautiful examples, because form and function are beauty.

Again, these bridges use the vertical strength of the tower (which uses rather than fights the forces of gravity).

A cable runs from anchors on the earth, over the towers. While this cable is subject to forces of gravity, it is held far above the road surface by the strong towers.

The suspension bridge hangs or is suspended from the upper cable by secondary vertical cables going down to the road surface.

Suspension bridges typically have two towers in order to span the space and to hol up the main upper cable.

The bridge is supported vertically by the orange cables.

By contrast, a cable-stayed bridge is stayed (a cross between supported and braced) on an oblique angle by its cables.

Both bridges use vertical towers as the closest thing to ‘skyhooks’ that we have been able to invent.

Suspension bridges tend to be older than cable-stayed bridges.
