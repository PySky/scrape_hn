The proposed system takes an input eye region, feature points ( ) as well as a correction and sends them to the multi-scale neural network predicting a field. The flow field is then applied to the input image to produce an image of a redirected eye. Finally, the output is enhanced by processing with the lightness correction neural network.

In this work, we consider the task of generating highly-realistic images of a given face with a redirected gaze. We treat this problem as a specific instance of conditional image generation, and suggest a new deep architecture that can handle this task very well as revealed by numerical comparison with prior art and a user study. Our deep architecture performs coarse-to-fine warping with an additional intensity correction of individual pixels. All these operations are performed in a feed-forward manner, and the parameters associated with different operations are learned jointly in the end-to-end fashion. After learning, the resulting neural network can synthesize images with manipulated gaze, while the redirection angle can be selected arbitrarily from a certain range and provided as an input to the network.|||
