I have worked on my project using a React-Redux architecture with React-Router for navigation. I have implemented forms for adding and editing resources. I have observed weird behavior:

I was expecting to see the current description of the resource: “My new comment…”, not the value from the previous form.

In my case, I was handling the state of the current form by using the same reducer:

I would like to share the solution that worked for me, my dear reader.

First of all, we need to create a new action “ROUTER.CHANGE” in the routes for handling router change:

Secondly, we should dispatch this action whenever the user navigates somewhere:

The next step is to add a new case “ROUTER.CHANGE” in the form reducer and clean up the current state, by returning an empty object:

Now the form state clears itself on every navigation. You can find the whole code change here.
