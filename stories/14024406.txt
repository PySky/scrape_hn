This year, Satellite is inspired by the way teams work. You'll learn how to bring together the people and tools you need to build great software. Find out what we've been working on, and hear how other teams use the GitHub ecosystem to customize the way they work.

You’ll also experience digital art installations and eat delicious food while exchanging experiences with developers from all over the world.
