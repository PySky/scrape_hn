So this guy asks me in a job interview last week "Have you ever developed in Go?" and well what's best to learn a language than writting a prepender (probably a lot of things but don't kill my thrill)?

There you have it, the probably first ever binary infector written in GoLang (SPTH LIP page "outdately" confirms that).

Basically a port from my Linux.Zariche 'cause my life is in a hurry. I need some time in now to improve those beauties.

Simple enough! Go is a quite fun language, I'll keep it in mind for future projects.|||
