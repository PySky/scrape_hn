Vanity Fair got their hands on the pitch deck for the now infamous Fyre Festival. This is my favorite slide. Emphasis added (obviously). As the magazine points out, the deck is worth reading not just for the schadenfreude but also for a look at the future of media … hint influencer marketing is a big, big, big deal.

The festival’s much-viewed YouTube video (filled with influencers — though where are the male influencer models?!?!) is still up. And, yeah. They are amazing marketers. They just needed a product team.|||
