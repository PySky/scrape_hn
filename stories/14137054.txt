We are happy to announce the release of Cloudron 0.110.0.

For those unaware, Cloudron is a platform that makes it easy to run apps on your server and keep them up-to-date.

The disk location where Cloudron stores application and platform data can now be set by passing during the installation step.

If you have an existing Cloudron, we recommend moving the existing data directory to a new location as follows Assuming, is the location to move your data, here's a migration script:

Previously, the Cloudron UI could only restore from the last backup and you had to use the CLI tool to restore from older backups.

The new App Restore UI allows you to restore from any of your previous backups. Note that on the Cloudron restoring from a backup revert not just the app data but also the app code to that point in time.|||

Cloudron v0.110.0 adds support for custom data location, new app restore UI and more security hardening
