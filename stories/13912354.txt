We believe the barrier to entry for people to start a startup is still too high. We want to make it easier for people to start a company, regardless of who or where you are, so we're starting by sharing what we've learned, through Startup School.

Startup School is a free 10-week massively open online course (MOOC). The course will begin on April 5th, 2017. Lectures will be posted here weekly.|||
