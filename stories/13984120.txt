You know FastMail provides the best in email but did you also know as part of your account you have file storage? All of our plans includes bonus storage for files in addition to your email account.

Today we are proud to reveal our improved file storage screens.

The cluttered, slow static screens have been replaced with a shiny, fast, responsive interface. The new three panel view lets you view and edit file and folder details dynamically, including image previews.

Easily upload your files and folders with drag and drop on the web interface. (Note: Safari does not support folder drag and drop) Our upload manager allows you to track your upload progress and cancel individual uploads, or even the whole batch at once.

Files support works just as well on our mobile apps as it does on the web interface (whether you're on mobile or desktop). You can even manage your files via FTP or WebDAV.

No screen refreshes required when files are uploaded from mobile or shared in a multi-user account: see them instantly on all FastMail clients.

Easily locate files and folders with our powerful search tool.

Once your files are uploaded, you can quickly attach them to emails.

You can even host simple websites and photo galleries from your file storage, and share files with other users in your account.

File quota limits apply, but they are independent of your mail quota: filling up your file storage won't affect delivery of your email!
