 We are about to see the outcome of a crash between Audi Q7 and Range Rover. The driver of the Rover was tired of living so he decided to crash into someone with high speed, the lucky winner was the driver of the Audi. Both cars have high level of security, but sometimes that is not enough to save your life.

You cannot predict things like this, but anyway, my advice to you is THINK TWICE before you do something crazy with your car, some things cannot be undone. You can not allow yourself to play games while you are behind the steering wheel, you are risking your own life, and other people’s lives as well. Watch the video below, I hope you’ll learn something out of it.|||
