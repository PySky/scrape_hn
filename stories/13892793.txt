BrotliHaxe is a brotli compression decoder and encoder handported from original C to the Haxe Cross-platform-Toolkit that generate readable pure source code in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Java, C#, ActionScript and other.

You can also:

Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression. Brotli Github

Haxe is an open source toolkit that allows you to easily build cross-platform tools and applications that target many mainstream platforms. Haxe Github

BrotliHaxe requires Haxe 3.x when you want compile code. (I already put generated source to this git)

Important! This four files must be in the build dir:

If you upload the files to webserver then change to binary else you get error while decoding & encoding.

For using as lib see source code at https://dominikhlbg.github.io/brotlijs/

Include the Brotli named file. (Java path: src/haxe/root/ else src/ or filename self)

You have four option. First both are string version.

The last two are byte array. [0...255]

Here you can see a small benchmark on an i7 2600k CPU.

This source code base on a nearly two years old brotli version but still works good. I'm update to actually soon.

I'm looking for optimise the different outputs. Maybe you can help? Great! But the source code shouldn't looks different from the original source code because that makes updating difficult.

That is my first source code that I release under MIT!|||
