The incident happened as a result of Rostelecom hijacking IP addresses from AS3741 which belongs to Internet Solutions and contains 3,079,168 IP addresses. An AS (Autonomous System) is a group of IP addresses grouped by BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to help direct Inyernet traffic where it needs to go.

The impact is said to have been minimal and for a limited period and so far indications are that it was not intentional and a likely result of misconfiguration.|||
