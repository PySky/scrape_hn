Some customers reflect that during the series resonant test, cursor of variable frequency power supply occurs flashover phenomenon. Through it donâ€™t have much effect on test result, the test data measuring is very inconvenient.

There are two types of cursor flashover: one is that the test starts flashing for a while, and the other is that the experiment is flashing. Here we give a brief introduction of these two reasons.

There is an electric potential difference between the test equipment and the test sample. So it is necessary to reliably connect the earth when the test is carried out. When we do series resonance test, if the test ground wire is not firmly connected, there will be a slight discharge phenomenon, resulting in the cursor flashover. In the case of the above, simply method is to connect the ground wire to ensure that the frequency conversion power supply, the test sample, the earth firmly grounded, the automatic removal of flashover phenomenon.

The cursor continues to flicker, usually in outdoor power engineering test site. Outdoor operation, usually by the generator or inverter power supply, voltage is very unstable. In addition, the frequency of the generator's power is different from the stable 380V/220V power, which can cause the cursor flashover. There is also a case, the sample in the process of boosting the emergence of the phenomenon of discharge, the screen display interference, but also lead to the cursor flashover.

The above reasons will only cause the frequency of power supply cursor temporary flashover, but will not appear in many experiments. If the above conditions are normal, the cursor indicates that short program flashover equipment failure, and equipment is repaired. In this case, the equipment should be returned to the manufacturer for inspection and maintenance by comprehensive professional engineering to ensure safe operation.|||
