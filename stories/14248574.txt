Today, the scene in San Franciscoâ€™s Mission district sent chills up my spine. Hereâ€™s how it looked, in photosÂ â€¦with a surprise ending.

The photo above is a candid snap of the three co-founders of my company, TINT. Tim, the CEO, is a child of Taiwanese and Thai immigrants. Ryo was born in Japan, and Nik (the guy in the middle who ruined my candid snap) is from India.

Without them, I would not have my well-paying tech job.

I promised a surprise ending to this article. At the end of the day, when I was feeling a little down, My mom sent me these two photos.

My brother-in-law, Orhan, born in Turkey, received his US citizenship today! Congratulations, and welcome, Orhan!

If you appreciate the immigrants in your life as much as I do, please ðŸ’š and share. It is important for these photos to be seen.|||
