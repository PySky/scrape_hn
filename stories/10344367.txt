This is a docker-compose cluster that uses mesos-slave-dind to collocate multiple slave nodes, each with their own docker daemon and /24 network allocation.

The cluster consists of several docker containers linked together by docker-managed hostnames:

Install all of the above via Homebrew.

Some steps print instructions for configuring or launching. Make sure each is properly set up before continuing to the next step.

Most of the above are available via apt and yum, but depending on your distribution, you may have to install via other means to get the latest versions.

It is recommended to use Ubuntu, simply because it supports OverlayFS, used by docker to mount volumes. Alternate file systems may not fully support docker-in-docker.

If on a Mac using Docker-Machine, the following step will make the docker IPs (in the virtualbox VM) reachable from the host machine (Mac).

Most configuration is contained in the docker-compose.yaml file.

Some other details (e.g. number of slaves) can be modified with environment variables. See env.sh for details.

In order to allow resolution of domain names on your host machine, mesos-dns need to be added as a nameserver.

WARNING: This can be done before or after create, but will slow down host domain name resolution if mesos-dns is not running.

This will remove the extra nameserver and leave the original one.

WARNING: Macs normally use auto-updating DNS, which is disabled as a side effect of dns-update. To restore auto-updates on network change: delete all DNS records in .
