Why should you care about protecting your communication and generally your data?

The right to privacy is the right to self. You “own” you. You decide when you want to share you and when you don’t.

Here’s a long list of arguments, unfortuantely in German, if you have a similar list in English, please let me know in the comments: https://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Ich_habe_nichts_zu_verbergen!

Or to make it less abstract: Would you mind giving me your email password? No? Why not? I thought you have nothing to hide?

Why is it more important to you that I can’t read all your emails than Merkel, Trump and Zuckerberg?

Why do you trust Trump more than me?

And yes, this is real, computers are actually reading your unencrypted communication (email and chat). And then when there are “investigations” many humans, police, politicians, security agencies can drill down and read every single of your email just because you wrote an email with someone 10 years ago who was potentially involved in a crime now. That is exactly what a lot of the fuzz with Snowden was about. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)

I hope until now you are conviced that you want to encrypt your communication. Don’t fear, the great thing is, that since 2016 it is significantly easier than it was before. It is actually now so easy that anybody can do it. Yes, my mom is sending me encrypted messages.

The great news is that this does not mean any overhead in your communication, you only need to install a new app. I will compare different possibilities and will rank them by justified reasons for the ranking.|||

tl;dr: Encrypt all your online (IM) communication, there is no good reason anymore to not do it. Use a XMPP+Omemo client (Conversations on Android, ChatSecure on iOS and Gajim for Windows/Mac/Linux)…
