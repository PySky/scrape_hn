Led by the meritocratic example of Linus Torvalds, the Linux development community successfully defeated an attempt by an SJW entryst to impose "civility and professionalism" i.e. a weaponized code of conduct, on the community:Good riddance. That is exactly what a successful anti-SJW defense looks like. If the entryist is whining and crying and angrily decrying the mean antediluvian neanderthals who won't cater to her feelings, you can be sure that the community she is attacking - and which she only cared about insofar as she could attempt to control it - did the right thing by refusing to give in to her.This is good news for Linux, as the flipside of the Impossibility of Social Justice Convergence suggests that those organizations that resist social justice incursions will be considerably more likely to remain focused on their primary functions.|||
