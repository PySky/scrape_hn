Yes: LXD containers give you the experience of virtual machines with the security of a hypervisor, but much, much faster. Without all the overhead, you get the full performance of your host environment. On bare metal, LXD containers are as fast as the native OS. In the cloud, you get subdivided machines without subpar performance.

You can live-migrate LXD containers from machine to machine. Weâ€™re working with silicon companies to ensure hardware-assisted security and isolation for containers, like virtual machines. Additionally, you can bind storage or network interfaces to the containers, just like virtual machines.|||
