The apple company does not rest, and so in the last hours released the fifth beta of MacOS 10.12.5 for developers and public testers.

According to Apple, MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 is a version that improves the stability of the system.

The visual and functional changes we saw in MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 with the introduction of Night Shift for Mac.

Due to the above, the beta version 10.12.5 brings us innovations internally of the system, like security patches, greater stability, better fluency or correction of some errors.

Most likely, Apple will present the next major update, MacOS 10.13, in WWDC 2017 that will begin next June 5.

As always, do not over recommend that you should make a backup first if you are installing this beta.

Remember that betas are usually tested versions of operating systems and therefore more susceptible to errors, so they can cause loss of data for the user.|||
