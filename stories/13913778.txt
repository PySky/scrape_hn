A tiny blogging platform that lets you write posts in Google Docs and syncs with a Google Drive directory.

This project is directly based upon the amazing Octopress project. However, I wanted a way to keep writing my posts in Google Docs, which is a good place to write & retain blog posts, and publish a Octopress blog out them. This project is a way forward, towards scratching that itch.

HexoPress is a web layer that authenticates the user with google, takes their blog posts from a folder in their google drive, generate a static blog out of it and serves them at a URL.

Now, pointing your browser to http://localhost:8000 should land it to your dev instance.|||
