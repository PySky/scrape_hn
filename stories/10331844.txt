The airborne leaflet operation at the Dagger Complex in Germany was successful!



The Dagger Complex in Darmstadt, Germany acts as a central point of the NSA's surveillance and espionage activity in Europe. On Friday Intelexit supporters, the initiative helping people break free from the secret services, dropped information flyers to the 1100 employees working there.



This is a wonderful way to reach out to the spying community â€“ we are currently working on more ways of participation to reach out and help people who want to break free.
