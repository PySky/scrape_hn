After six months of work, the Herbie developers are excited to announce Herbie 1.1! This release focuses on making Herbie easier to use, including a web interface, clear syntax errors, and detailed reports. This release also expands support for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and speeds up preconditions.

Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so often occur when working with floating point. Since our PLDI'15 paper, we've been hard at work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.

We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming months. Please report bugs, join the mailing list, or contribute.

If you find Herbie useful, let us know!|||
