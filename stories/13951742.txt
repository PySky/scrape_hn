First, this book is not an endless guide to all things math symbols and there are some limitations. Though it does provide a useful guide for students.



One of the major limits of this book is that it is limited to math. So if you are reading an equation in your Calculus book and want to look up a symbol in this book you may not find it. Because it is a physics symbol. Like angular veloctiy ( lower case omega ) won't be found here, but it is covered in the book from a pure mathematical standpoint.



Also this book does not cover every usage since math books were written.



one minor thing I notice missing was epsilon defined for Calculus limits in this book.



He does a great job with the standard greek usage for functions, like Euler totient and such. And he provides the same for constants that everyone should probably know.



Also he does a great job of clarifying when multiple symbols are used for the same notation, and how to use them without mixing and matching. So there is some elements of style in this book.



The index by Greek letter is not totally complete, since it does not include the numerical constants. ( kind of odd ). But it is very helpful that the book has and index by symbols, both greek and otherwise, and an topical index.



The latex chart is a nice bonus.



Overall for the novice student this is better than trying to search a website, and it is informational. For the advanced student, it might not be the book for you.



All in all it is still worth the price.|||
