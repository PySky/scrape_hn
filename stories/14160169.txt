Don't worry, you can still try it out today. Follow the instructions in the Step-by-Step Guide to build your integration. You can create and manage bug bounty test users here which you can use to immediately test Delegated Account Recovery with Facebook for your site.

Once you've finished building and testing your integration, you can apply for our closed beta program to enable all accounts to use Delegated Account Recovery with your site. As part of the review process for the closed beta, the Facebook Identity Tools team may contact you to collaborate on topics including security, customer messaging and the use of the Facebook brand in your deployment.|||
