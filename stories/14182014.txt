Millions of Google Chrome users should update their browsers later this week to stop a shocking new vulnerability in the software.

With a 57 per cent market share, Google Chrome is the world's most popular web browser and that makes it a big target for hackers and cyber criminals.

This latest issues was discovered by security researcher Xudong Zheng who warned the vulnerability makes phishing attacks "almost impossible to detect."

The clever hack displays fake domain names in the URL address bar – like Apple, Google, or Amazon – on their own fraudulent websites.

This makes phishing attacks notoriously tough to detect, since the victim's web browser appears to confirm they're on a legitimate web domain with a secure HTTPS connection.

Online users could enter their payment details into a website that looks exactly like the official site – with no idea they're actually on a fake webpage, designed by hackers to steal your information.|||
