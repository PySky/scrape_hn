Hey! it’s me again! I’m glad you guys enjoyed my last story about setting up Webpack. Today I would like to share a really cool feature which will definitely help you analyse your habits and boost productivity.

Pretty cool eh! Best part about Wakatime is I don’t have to press a button to start tracking my time. It does it automatically, it’s really something thus I wanted to share it with you.

It works like this:

There are no tricks. You just need to register a Wakatime account (did I mention it’s free?) and insert the API key to your text-editor. I’ll show you how to do it here.

Head over to https://wakatime.com/ and register your free account.

Grab your API key. Don’t share it anyone because the data will get unreliable. We want reliable data!

Great, here’s how you can install it for Atom and Sublime.

Assuming you have Atom Package Manager, here’s how to install it. If you don’t have APM, go to Atom → Install shell commands.

That’s it! We now have the package. Now we need to insert our API key.|||
