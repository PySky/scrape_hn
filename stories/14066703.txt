The goal is to take a C++ project and convert all the source code to D language.

Majority of C++ code is already convertible to D.

Be aware than this project is far to be finished. Do not expect a fully working D project immediately. That you can expect is a great help to the conversion of your project, doing all the simple repetitive job, which is not so bad.

CPP2D work like any clang tools. This could help you:

There is two way to use CPP2D:

It seems to be impossible to generate a compilation database under windows...

If you are not under windows, and you are using cmake to compile your project:

$ project/build/directory Run cmake, asking it to generate a compilation database $ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/project/sources Link it to the source project $ ln -s /compile_commands.json path/to/project/source/ $ path/to/project/source $ project/build/directory/CPP2D/cpp2d source1.cpp source2.cpp source3.cpp You will find D files in the project/build/directory You also need to copy the cpp_std.d file to your D source directory $ cp project/build/directory/CPP2D/cpp_std.d dproject/source

Need for more documentation? You can search here :

Small C++ project are almost fully convertible to D, but many things have to be done for the bigger ones.

I would be happy to get some help on this project. If you are interested, do not hesitate to :|||
