The two terms are not really talking about the same thing. "The Internet" is really the transport layer, typically TCP-IP, and rapidly becoming encrypted everywhere using "TLS".

The "Internet of Things" you can view of a section on the Pie-Chart which breaks down different uses for this underlying transport layer. Its not a new technology in itself, even if it is made possible by new technology (meaning vastly reduced costs).

Internet traffic today is vastly different to 10 years ago. Back then, internet was, to a large extent, humans reading individual web pages, and a little bit of video and shopping. Now, there is vastly more streaming video and music, people working from home, automated data collection - just to give a few ideas.

The term "IoT" is used to refer to a phase in the evolution of the internet.

Think of transport. We still have roads, but now in addition to walking, bikes, card and horses, we have (some) autonomous vehicles, "hoverboards", jet packs and drones. Would it be useful to have a term you can refer to transport innovations 2015-2025?|||
