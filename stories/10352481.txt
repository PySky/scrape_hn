RTI International, a research institute dedicated to making data immediately useful, has created a map of obesity in the United States that shows variations in obesity by neighborhood. Since obesity varies by location, identifying more at-risk populations not only allows organizations and public health officials to better target resources to address obesity, but also gives community stakeholders a better understanding of their neighborhoodâ€™s demographics. Users can view the data in three ways: obesity by overall body mass index, obesity versus the national average, or statistically significant clusters that show pockets of dense obesity or the lack of obesity. RTI used publicly available data from a number of sources, including the 2010 Census, the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The data for the Neighborhood Map of U.S. Obesity is also available for download.
