The Skittle Genome Browser provides powerful data visualizations that allow humans and computers to do what they are best at, respectively. Each data visualization is a mathematical trans­form that creates an image from the raw sequence data designed to make some aspect of the sequence intuitive to human pattern recognition. Skittle's unique approach presents the raw data to the user without biasing assumptions about what the sequence contains such as arbitrary thresholds or filters.

For example: the Nucleotide Display transforms four characters (ACTG) into four colors. Browsing several human chromosomes reveals abrupt changes in nucleotide usage bias (isochores) which are present at even small scales (less than one kilobase). This creates a vis­ually interesting pattern that you can interactively browse. Another visualiza­tion, the Repeat Map graph, shows all possible repeats in a given region--everything from ATAT repeats to seg­mental duplications are presented on a single screen.

Skittle is an entire toolset of graphs each with their own strength. Used in combination, they create a powerful re­search tool that you can use to quickly characterize a genetic sequence without any previous knowledge or any assump­tions that would cause you to miss important discoveries.|||
