Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).

Recursion is very important concept in computer science and one just cannot neglect this topic. True, it can be very confusing and difficult to understand, especially for the beginners but once you understand this topic, it opens a whole new world for you. Recursion just takes practice to get good at and nothing is more interesting than finding a solution to a problem ‚Äúrecursive‚Äù way.
