Having recently joined a small startup, I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can about building teams from Stripe (you can see a list of posts and videos by Stripe at the bottom of this article along with my notes).

I chose to focus on Stripe because I really admire their team’s quality and their emphasis on showing rather than telling. You’ll rarely hear Patrick or John Collison say “we hire rockstars” or “we only take the best of the best” or some derivative of that phrase. Instead, they show that they hire great people through every little detail on their product, website, and blog post they write.

Moreover, Stripe is also unique in how long-term minded and deliberate the founders are in building their team. Stripe took nearly 2 years to recruit their first 7 people and the first few hires went through weeks of interviewing before joining. This to me is particularly unique in an environment where companies can easily slip into using headcounts as a proxy for progress.

So what then can we learn from this original approach to team building? Below are the high level lessons I’ve picked up. Note they are just my opinions and not fact.|||
