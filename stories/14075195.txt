VTA’s FY18-19 Transit Service Plan is the product of a year-long community conversation about how VTA can improve its transit network.  Its goals are to connect with BART service at the new Milpitas and Berryessa Stations, increase ridership and improve cost-effectiveness.  The plan would be implemented in late 2017, coinciding with the start of BART service to Santa Clara County.

We encourage you to explore the plan using the links below.
