Developed in Python, Django and MongoDB for iPhone, Android and Web, the mSpa app lets a spa business easily interact with customers so they can view all services, book an appointment, and take advantage of special promotions and discounts. Spa owners can add their business details, services categories, detailed descriptions, offers and location through the web. That information shows up dynamically in the app while appointments booked by users from the app display in the spa ownerâ€™s web URL.
