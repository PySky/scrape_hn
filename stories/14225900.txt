What happens when Pied Piper comes to Google? Thomas Middleditch, Kumail Nanjiani, Amanda Crew, Zach Woods, and Martin Starr Talk Season 4 of HBO's Silicon Valley, and the lines between reality and fiction blur.



More about the show: In the high-tech gold rush of modern Silicon Valley, the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success. Showrunners Mike Judge (Office Space, Beavis & Butthead, King of the Hill) and Alec Berg (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm) have teamed up to satirize Silicon Valley in this award-winning comedy now airing its fourth season.



Silicon Valley is on Sundays on HBO at 10pm.
