Both 432 Hz and 528 Hz are healing tones have been written about quite a lot lately. Information on 432 Hz & 528 Hz are related to tuning fork tones, musical notes and as well as vocals and chanting. Two separate emails regarding healing effect of 432 Hz crossed my desk twice in one week. Since i don’t believe in coincidence I immediately began researching 432 Hz.

As it turns out the A-musical note was tuned to 432 Hz back 5000 years ago in India and Egypt and through the days of Brahms and Mozart, and in then in 1938 the Illuminati, through collaboration between the Rockefeller Foundation and Nazi Germany, achieved world-wide acceptance of musical A-note re(de)-tuned to 440 Hz. Evidently, it was their intention to remove the healing – soothing effect of music sung or played when tuned at 432 Hz.

Since I designed the EarthPulse™ with vertical rise pulsed square waveform, I knew the EarthPulse™ creates harmonics….and its 50% duty cycle (on 1/2 the time) rather rich harmonics. For instance, harmonics of a 10 Hz square wave signal would be 20 Hz, 30 Hz, 40 Hz etc. etc. So, I thought I’d see how the harmonics of our primary use frequency 9.6 Hz looked in relation to 432 Hz.

Without getting into a discussion of the gazillion sine waves combined to erect each square wave, we’ll keep it simple and just use the 9.6 Hz. It turns out 432 Hz / 9.6 Hz = dead on 45; and if you’re into numerology / Pythagorean math 4 + 5 = 9 (remember that number 9). Very curious I thought.

While researching 432 Hz, I found a number of interesting articles on 528 Hz and healing effect on DNA. Though scientific citations don’t seem to exist, there’s more information out there about 528 Hz tuning forks, chanting and the like than there is for 432 Hz. There are references to tuning A-note up further to 444 Hz so that middle-C-note resonates at 528 Hz. That this was an alternative tuning for healing music. After finding a number of articles indicating some possible value, I thought I’d see how the harmonics of 9.6 Hz related to 528 Hz.

I was amazed to find that 528 Hz / 9.6 Hz = exactly 55 times

After reading all he could find on the subject (though a bit esoteric for me) the author believes some attention is warranted, particularly since it relates to our primary frequency 9.6 Hz. This “coincidence” I thought suggested some spiritual, psychological and physical benefits.

Enjoy this short video about numerology and the number 9. You will see below how many of these measurements are harmonically related to 9.6 Hz and it’s sub-harmonics 4.8 Hz, 3.2 Hz, 2.4 Hz & 1.2 Hz.

While there is quite a lot of information on 444 Hz tuned A-note in the article, it appears as if 444 Hz is used so that the C-note is tuned to 528 Hz. A 432 Hz A-note would be out of key with a C-note resonating at 528 Hz. EarthPulse™ set at 9.6 Hz resonates at both 432 Hz & 528 Hz simultaneously!

It appears as if one can benefit from both of those tones by exposing yourself to 9.6 Hz square wave PEMF. While 9.6 Hz resonates with a remarkable number of measurements,  4.8 Hz, 2.4 Hz and 1.2 Hz resonate with even more of these. These are also much deeper rhythms that are helpful in entraining brain to sleep. Remarkably, my experimentation during 2015 has found surprising little difference in recovery when using these lower harmonics.

The sub-harmonics of 9.6 Hz are 4.8 Hz, 2.4 Hz and 1.2 Hz. We will discuss all of them in relationship to galactic and terrestrial measurements, healing tones and sacred geometry. As I’m not a mathematician, this will be kept very basic.

1.2, 2.4 Hz harmonics hit 432 Hz, 444 Hz AND 528 Hz dead-on. 432 Hz divided by 4.8 Hz = 90 (9 + 0 = 9 again); by 2.4 = 180 (1 + 8 = 9 again). The author is now alternating nights of 9.6 Hz and 4.8 Hz and 2.4 Hz.  I find these lower harmonics excellent for sleep (when too much caffeine) and an imperceptible difference in how I feel the following day. 1.2 Hz after two nights in a row I’m drained.

So, I’ve found 2.4 and 4.8 Hz to be excellent MANUAL-MODE settings for our insomniac clients where 9.6 Hz or RECOVER-MODE is too high.

So, in a nutshell the new MANUAL-MODE on the v5 and v5Pro gives user ability to use our low frequency settings yet achieve holistic benefits of 432 Hz and 528 Hz along with the base frequency of 9.6 Hz. This corresponds nicely to well known beneficial 10 Hz effects of PEMF proven by these studies including NASA.

As stated previously, I’m no mathematician so while there are particular settings inside our range of 1 – 14.1 Hz (131 possible frequency settings) that harmonise with the odd-ducks 417 Hz and 639 Hz, I sure won’t be able to tell you. The point here though is that 1/2 of these new (to my ears) healing tones, harmonise with sub-harmonics of 9.6 Hz too. Evidently this Whole Tones list is a list of Solfeggio Frequencies used in sacred music, including the beautiful and well known Gregorian Chants.

Due to personal experience and consistently strong customer results, we feel our tuning of EarthPulse™ to  9.6 Hz does in fact exceed results reported by published works on 10 Hz. We are very proud to go back to our roots and provide a digital system capable of producing and holding precisely 9.6 Hz (or it’s subharmonics 1.2 Hz, 2.4 Hz, 3.2 Hz & 4.8 Hz) in the new MANUAL-MODE setting for entire duration of run time.

“A note – 432Hz is proper, and verified by Rosicrucian charts in which they call it the Cosmic Keyboard. I won’t post them here as I am not an AMORC member, but I found them online and in books I own. They show the correlations of the frequencies to color and other ranges in the spectrum as well. A432Hz puts your C# at OM. A-U-M is the “Power-Chord” of C#, it’s 5th the G#, then C# again at an octave higher. We know this from the tuning of the Sitar in classical Indian music, the teachings of the gurus and yogis, the Tibetan monks who tell us “it comes from nature”, and the scientific research of the Rosicrucians.” ~ KAOSTheory blogger

Sonic Geometry: The Language of Frequency – 9.6 Hz resonates at 144 Hz, 432 Hz, 720 Hz, 1440 Hz & the Flower of Life’s 2160 Hz. In the case of 2160 Hz 225th harmonic (and 2 + 2 + 5 equals 9). Remember that number 9.

How we chose 9.6 Hz in 2002 & it’s relationship to sacred healing tones and ancient metrology: 9.6 Hz emanating from Earth’s core was discovered by Robert C. Beck. In a paper by Robert Forniere he talks about Earth’s micorpulsation of 10 Hz. I was introduced to electromedicine in 1996 through a lecture at the Whole Life Expo in Las Vegas by a researcher in his 70’s named Bob Beck. I bought the blood pulser (silver pulser) and strong magnetic pulser and haven’t had the flu since. Neither has my Mom (and she’s just used colloidal silver for 18 years…not the blood electrification or strong pulser). But I travel a lot and spend time in 3rd world countries and can tell you those two items have saved me more than just a couple of times. You can buy those products through www.sota.com. The silver-pulser should be part of everyone’s alt-med kit. Back in 1996 my first engineer built a strong magnetic pulser and the blood pulser though Bob’s open source plans and gave them to his uncle in March of 1997 after he was sent home from hospital to die of terminal cancer within 2-3 months. He became what you’d call a “religious pulser”. At Thanksgiving dinner later that year, Vinnie, my engineer said not only was his uncle still alive, but he looked healthier than anyone else there for dinner. You can see most of existing Bob Beck videos at our Bob Beck page. See other peoples’ testimonials of using the Bob Beck protocol on various ailments through this thorough YouTube search. During a taped interview of Bob I was listening to in 1998 I heard him describe an experiment he did in the 1950’s or 60’s after he’d become interested in Schumann waves. He described his research into Schumann waves and Shamans’ & Energy Healers’ brain-waves during the development of his Brain-Tuner CES (cranial electric stimulation) system. In an effort to see if the terrestrial Earth had a frequency that was similar to, or different than Schumann, or if Schumann might have been caused by terrestrial magnetic field aberrations, Beck drove metal rods 20 feet into the ground to act as antennaes, hooked them up to an amplifier and then through an oscilloscope. He discovered that the Earth did have a resonating frequency, and it was 9.6 Hz! So Is It 9.6 Hz or 10 Hz for Maximum Effects? I had already identified a clear pattern of far more robust results at or around 10 Hz in 1996-97 by reading mostly Eastern European literature. So, I’d already begun working on a DC microcurrent stimulation system at 10 Hz square wave as early as 1998. I modified my microcurrent stim design in 2000 to precisely 9.6 Hz because i’d concluded that it was no coincidence that the Earth had a pulse rate of 9.6 Hz and that the 10 Hz studies were showing clearly better results than all others, no matter at higher or lower frequency. In 2001 I began designing the EarthPulse™ v.1 pulsed electromagnet at precisely 9.6 Hz. I was a student of Rife technologies and had concluded harmonics were good, AC was unhealthy for long term exposure. On 24th May 2002 v1 EarthPulse was introduced as a 9.6 Hz, 200 Gauss pulsed DC square wave. I received the first two prototypes and began testing them achieving spectacular results on myself and others. Old troubling sports injuries suddenly started healing themselves. I was sleeping better than ever. More importantly, others were reporting the same things on the loaner systems I was slowly accumulating. I filed patent Oct 2002 and immediately began marketing them. It was designed specifically for Parkinson’s and other neurological issues. However, by the end of a few weeks I’d determined that what I’d soon be calling EarthPulse™ was so much more than a Parkinson’s disease remedy. Our current v.5 is 650 gauss across the square wave but has a nanosecond peak on the leading edge of 950 Gauss with the sleep configured magnet. 1100 Gauss with Cross-Polarity ring installed for local application. See our tech specs link for more info. You can see video documentation of what 9.6 Hz did for Parkinson’s clients in 2002 on our YouTube® channel. See the Parkinson’s play-list. I’d always felt the older analog EP’s had maybe 20% better effect on Parkinson’s despite the increased power from one version to the next. RECOVER-MODE is centred on 9.6 Hz but spends 50% of the time scanning up and down between 9.1 Hz and 10.1 Hz. Now with the MANUAL-MODE it is possible to set controller dead-on 9.6 Hz, or it’s sub harmonics of 2.4 or 4.8 Hz for entire run-time. We look forward to better than ever feedback with this capability and all the extra power. Now 13 years after our v.1 system set at 9.6 Hz DC square wave and some 10,000 clients later; an interesting new discovery about 9.6 Hz (but a bit esoteric), that may hold the key to why our systems have been so effective all along. Numerology of 9.6 Hz as it relates to 432 Hz 444 Hz 528 Hz: Some other interesting numerology regarding the lower subharmonics of 9.6 Hz; i.e. 4.8 Hz, 3.2 Hz, 2.4 Hz and 1.2 Hz and, if one where to add one more step of 2.4 to 9.6 Hz you get 12 Hz; OK enough of that…but did mention I don’t believe in coincidence? “Life is the result of an inherent numerical, geometric, musical and cosmological template that has pervaded the Universe since its inception.” Anthony Morris Though I may be reading too much importance into these tones, the fact that they’d been around for 5000 years or more and that a lot of time and a lot of money was spent by less than nefarious forces to remove them from music, seem’s like there’s something to it. Here is another interesting numerological relationship pointed out to me by our beautiful and intelligent Tech-Support Representative Shaun; See the Tesla quote at the top of the page about 3 / 6 / 9. All numbers divisible by 3 and the Pythagorean relationship between the sum of the numbers 9 + 12 + 15 = 36  and 3 + 6 = 9 yet again. And if you were to take the sum of the blue numbers on the right hand side  9 + 3 + 6  = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 AGAIN. Now, relationally, check this… correct or not (numerologically) All numbers divisible by 3 and the Pythagorean relationship between the sum of the numbers 3 + 6 + 12 + 15 = 36 and 3 + 6 = 9 yet again. And, if you were to take 3 + 6 + 3 + 6  = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 yet again.

A recent subscription article at Nexus magazine on numerology and the cosmic universe outlined quite a bit of data on the number 7920 (7 + 9 + 2 = 18  and 1 + 8 = 9). A quick rundown of the “metrology” of ancient megaliths like the Giza Pyramids and even DNA relate to this template according to Morris.

In his article Morris listed these other examples of 7920

The Earth’s diameter is 7920 Miles (7 + 9 + 2 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 again)

With a diameter of 7920 Miles, the Earth’s circumference is 24,883.2 miles.

and the Flower of Life’s sum of it’s angles = 2160  / 9.6 Hz = 225 (2 + 2+ 5 = 9 AGAIN).

So in early December (2014) after starting to compute the numbers above and never ONCE using MANUAL-MODE setting for sleep, I began setting my v.5Pro system MANUAL-MODE 9.6 Hz. It has been the first time since the analog v.1 / v.2 that i’m sleeping just 6 hours and waking up long before the alert phase begins to kick in not wanting to stay in bed any longer.  And I love to sleep,… so this is very surprising. UPDATE: 17th Nov 2015: still sleeping 6 hours and waking on my own. This is truly remarkable. And i’m in training mode right now for 4 weeks and I’d know if i was sleep deprived. Because it’s locks on 9.6 Hz precisely all night, my body is feeling fully recovered and rested after just 6 hours. Where normally RECOVER-MODE would be on 9.6 Hz just 50% of it’s run time (stepping up or down 1/2 Hz the other 50%). This is the first time since going digital in 2005 this waking up early has happened. So, this could explain why our Parkinson’s clients did better on the old analog system set at 9.6 Hz until 2005; than on the post 2005 digital systems. As of August when we released v5, it includes MANUAL-MODE function that boots directly to 9.6 Hz. It allows you to set at any frequency from 1 Hz to 14.1 Hz (including Schumann 7.8. 1.5 and 2.4 Hz) and 14.1 Hz and run the system up to 12 hours for sleep, meditation, or as a Schumann wave generator. For EMF protection the ALERT-MODE setting is a far better choice as an interruptive signal due to its constant stepping up and down to help mitigate effects of WiFi and other RF signals. It may take you some time to get where you can sleep in RECOVER-MODE, but once you do, try MANUAL-MODE 9.6 Hz. If you can’t yet sleep in RECOVER-MODE then try MANUAL-MODE 4.8 Hz, (3.2 Hz or 2.4 Hz); and when you use the EP for recovery issues, DEFINITELY set it exactly at 9.6 Hz rather than using RECOVER. Dec 2015 update: Currently in training mode. 4.8 Hz for several nights in a row i feel very little difference between rate of recovery from 9.6 Hz. 2.4 Hz after 3 nights i’m feeling some muscles, by 4th morning i know it’s time to go back to 9.6 Hz. One night and all muscle fatigue gone. I’ll be leaving further 2.4 Hz research to my clients. To your good health. Live long and prosper, Paul F. Becker, Esq.|||
