DragoNN provides a toolkit to learn how to model and interpret regulatory sequence data using deep learning. It is intended to provide biologists and computational scientists the resources to get started with deep learning modeling and interpreting of regulatory sequence. The toolkit provides ipython notebooks to simulate regulatory sequence, train DragoNN models on simulated data, and discover and evaluate nucleotide-resolution features. It also provides a command line interface for simple modeling and interpretation of your own sequence data.

See the DragoNN Tutorial to get started. Share your DragoNN models in the Model Zoo.|||
