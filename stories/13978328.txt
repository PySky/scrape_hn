When I created our Series A deck, I presented a growth curve that would be good enough to get an investment, but I also had confidence that I could beat it. I wanted to be able to go into my Series B presentation and say, "Here’s what I said before, and here’s how I did." Because we beat our Series A expectations for network growth, investors could comfortably trust our promise to build revenue with our Series B financing.|||

At Greylock , my partners and I are driven by one guiding mission: always help entrepreneurs. It doesn’t matter whether an entrepreneur is in our portfolio, whether we’re considering an investment, or whether we’re casually meeting for the first time.
