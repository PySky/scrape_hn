A typical response to a StatHat stat API call looks like this:

It’s pretty small. 152 bytes. But users sent in 150 billion requests last month, and StatHat responded with that 152 bytes to them all, which is 20 terabytes.

After studying RFC 7231, we are going to change the default success response to:

It is 25 bytes (maybe 26 with a blank line after the header), 127 bytes leaner.

The response is an accurate description of a successful API request:

While the header field is encouraged, it is optional:

So let’s just pretend we don’t have a good clock.

None of the official StatHat libraries look at the body of the response, they just care about the 2xx success status. We have tried this response in production on a subset of the requests and have not received any reports of it being a problem, so we are rolling it out for all requests.

Note that we will still provide details for multiple stats uploaded in a JSON request and any error cases.

If you have code that parses the original body and would like to continue doing so, include a request parameter with your POST or GET request and the servers will respond with the original verbose body output.

This change should remove about 17 terabytes of useless data from the internet pipes each month.|||
