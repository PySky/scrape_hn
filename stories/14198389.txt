Dodo is a retro game system that runs on a real 6502 processor available as a kit. All parts are easy to solder through-hole components. Games are fun to develop using the playground in the cloud. No local software needs to be installed other than a Chrome App. In fact a Chromebook is the perfect development environment which makes Dodo a great fit for education.
