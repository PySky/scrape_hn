Lack of updates is a security problem for most home routers. Omnia offers unattended automatic updates to core components of the system for the lifetime of the device.

One of the biggest security problems in home routers is the fact that they usually have an old firmware. Unfortunately, a home router is as much a computer as your notebook and security related issues are discovered all the time. Just imagine a normal PC running a few years without any update. With Omnia, we decided to change that. We offer unattended automatic updates to core components of the system for the lifetime of the device. The updates are done in the background and you may be informed about them if you wish.|||
