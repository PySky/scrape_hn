Photos and clips of the humanoid robot, which is four-metres-tall (13-foot) and weighs  1.5 tons, first surfaced online last year, however sceptics have questioned the authenticity of footage released showing the robot walking.

Bezos was filmed controlling the robot’s arms in the latest footage; however it was attached to some chains and was seemingly unable to actually walk around by itself.

The suit was created by robotics expert Vitaly Bulgarov, a veteran of science fiction blockbusters, for the South Korean technology company.|||
