Docker is probably the most talked-about infrastructure technology of the past few years. We started this project to investigate how much Docker is used in production, and how fast real adoption is growing. We found the answers to these questions—and more that we discovered along the way—to be fascinating.

The research that follows was based on a sample of 10,000 companies, and 185 million containers in real-world use. As far as we know, this is the largest and most accurate review of Docker adoption that has ever been published.

Throughout this article we refer to companies' adoption status: "adopted", "dabbling", or "abandoned". Our method for determining adoption status is described in the Methodology section below.|||

With thousands of companies using Datadog to track their infrastructure, we can see software trends emerging in real time. Today we&#039;re excited to share what we can see about true Docker adoption—no hype, just the facts.
