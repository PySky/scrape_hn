Not long ago, Facebook began experimenting with live video in 360, allowing a small number of major media outlets to stream immersive video to their fans and followers. National Geographic was the first, with other notable events including the Academy Awards red carpet event and the inauguration of Donald Trump. A few short months later, and the feature is available to all profiles and pages across Facebook. This is a big deal because the company is finally catching up to Periscope, which revealed their 360 live-streaming capabilities back at the end of 2016. Users with 360 cameras have been waiting for this moment since Facebook enabled the uploading of 360 photos and videos. Live 360 seemed to be the logical evolutionary path.

Facebook has also introduced the spatial audio formatting for live 360 videos. This basically means that you will feel like you are actually there.|||

The social media giant now lets anyone with a 360 camera stream live in 360!..
