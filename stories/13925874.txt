Canonical announced the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) release almost 5 years ago, on April 26, 2012. As with all LTS releases, Canonical has provided ongoing security patches and bug fixes for a period of 5 years. The Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long Term Support) period will end on Friday, April 28, 2017.

Following the end-of-life of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Canonical is offering Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (Extended Security Maintenance), which provides important security fixes for the kernel and the most essential user space packages in Ubuntu 12.04. These updates are delivered in a secure, private archive exclusively available to Ubuntu Advantage customers on a per-node or per hour basis.

All Ubuntu 12.04 LTS users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. But for those who cannot upgrade immediately, Ubuntu 12.04 ESM updates will help ensure the on-going security and integrity of Ubuntu 12.04 systems.

Users interested in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM updates can purchase Ubuntu Advantage from our online store. For AWS users, you can purchase Ubuntu Advantage Standard or Advanced through the AWS Marketplace. Credentials for the private archive will be available by the end-of-life date for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (April 28, 2017).
