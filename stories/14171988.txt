Yes, the animal on the left is a dog and not a Hyena (Don't believe me? Google it).

Pay special attention to the eyes, smile and the body language. You may be able to see some physical characteristics similar to humans in the dog on the right.

EDIT: In case you're not able to visualise the similarities, see this

There is enough research on the fact that we like people who look like us. Great salesmen find things that are common between them and the buyer to create that connection.

The same concepts should be used while designing products. "Human centred design" is one of the biggest mega-trends in Design Industry. It makes your product way more usable and acceptable.

On Friday 28th April 2017, we, Design Delhi, are coming together at Ideashacks Coworking, Faridabad to discuss the philosophy of Design. We will be focussed on the concepts that a software developer can use in their professional life.

If you're in Delhi/NCR this week, you can RSVP here to attend the FREE event.

PS: Not everything can/should be designed to look like human.|||
