April Fools’ Day is the most wonderful time of the year — if you’re so bored by your job in marketing that pre-briefing journalists on fictional new products is “fun.” For the rest of us, April 1 is “useless internet day,” and most April Fools’ pranks are just dumb PR stunts.

So congratulations are in order to Snap, which came up with the only thing from among this year’s pranks that legitimately made me laugh. Take a picture with Snapchat and swipe right to get the first filter: A fake Instagram overlay for your photos.
