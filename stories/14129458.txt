Easter holidays have finally come! 🐣🐇🥚 It is a warm and beautiful part of the year associated with Spring and nature. Most of us would spend the following couple of days in the family circle or with friends.

And there is no better way of expressing your love and gratitude than via some warm and festive Easter cards which you can print, send via email or social media 🌸 You can modify most of the Easter cards designs we compiled in this article using Vectr to make them personal and unique. We’d also prepared a tutorial on creating Easter icons for you.
