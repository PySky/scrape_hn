Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s high-profile divorce proved to be “jarring” for the famous family, which includes the former couple’s six kids — Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8. But the actor, who revealed to GQ Style that he stopped drinking and is in therapy, is making an effort to connect with his children on a deeper level — something he, himself, lacked growing up.

“I grew up with a Father-knows-best/war mentality — the father is all-powerful, super strong — instead of really knowing the man and his own self-doubt and struggles,”

“And it’s hit me smack in the face with our divorce: I gotta be more. I gotta be more for them. I have to show them. And I haven’t been great at it.”
