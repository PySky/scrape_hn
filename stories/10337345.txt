Tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon could be forced to set up separate European databases, following an opinion issued by the European Court of Justice.

Advocate general Yves Bot - whose advice is generally followed by the court - has accused US intelligence agenciesof 'indiscriminate surveillance' incompatible with EU fundamental rights.

And national data protection regulators, he says, have the authority to protect those rights by suspending transfers of data to the US.

The Safe Harbour mechanism is based on an agreement reached between the EU and the US in 2000, and designed to facilitate the transfer of commercial data between the two. It's used by about 4,500 companies to transfer commercial information such as payroll and customer data.

But it's also used by companies such as Facebook to transfer your personal data; and this is the nub of the case, brought by Austrian law student Max Shrems following Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA spying.

He argued that the personal data he'd provided to Facebook, which was transferred from the company's Irish subsidiary to the US under the Safe Harbour scheme hadn't been adequately protected - and the advocate general agrees.

"The Advocate General considers... that the access enjoyed by the United States intelligence services to the transferred data constitutes an interference with the right to respect for private life and the right to protection of personal data, which are guaranteed by the Charter," reads his decision.|||
