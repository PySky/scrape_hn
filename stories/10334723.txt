Install it via Bower or NPM.

To provide a promise like syntax for attaching handlers to the DOM.

This helps you to reuse the same event for dealing with multiple stuff across your code.

in the way you can use the variable to attach callbacks anywhere in your code, like this:

This way you are using the same handler created by Provent, but attaching a second callback, nice isn't it?!

Also, the parameter points to the same object as the callback, and so does the variable as well.

Add the event listener to the element, and returns a "promise".

Used to attach callbacks to the element, returns the same promise with the previous returned value as parameter.

Removes all the callbacks and the DOM event from the element.

If the is passed, removes only the callbacks that had the same id registered.

aClick ( . ( ), ); . ( () {}) . ( , () {}); . ( ); the second callback will be removed . (); all callbacks and the event listener are removed

Please respect the indentation rules and code style.

You need NodeJS installed on your machine|||
