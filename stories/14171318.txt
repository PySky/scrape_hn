YouTube channel ColdFusion has released a new video that explores the latest developments in artificial intelligence. The video looks at stacked generative adversarial networks, and how the progress of AI could drastically alter society.

"It seems like playtime is over in regards to AI."

The YouTube channel ColdFusion (previously called ColdfusTion) has released a new video that explores the latest developments in artificial intelligence."Imagine typing a descriptive sentence of a theme, and having an artificial intelligence generate a convincing photorealistic image just from your text input," asks Dagogo Altraide in the video. "This has just been created."The system, detailed in this paper , uses an AI system called Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN).Creating  photorealistic images from text descriptions alone is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Up until recently, samples generated by other text-to-image approaches could only roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions and failed to contain necessary details and vivid, recognizable image output.To point to one area where the StackGAN approach may one day be used, think about how Tony Stark designs his Iron Man suit with the help of J.A.R.V.I.S. Stark isn't sitting at a CAD system plugging in numbers and detailing every aspect of the suit design, he is giving broad descriptions, and letting the AI system fill in all the necessary details.The adversarial neural network used in the paper above is one possible path to such a system.As Altraide describes,This software architecture creates a feedback loop of continuous improvement without human intervention, that keeps cleaning and refining the images generated. As Altraide comments, "The end results are nothing short of stunning."The video also highlights the AI generated sound system, WaveNet and a system from Carnegie Mellon University that has mastered Texas Hold 'Em poker . WaveNet is capable of producing natural-sounding human speech and music on its own.Jeff Dean's recent talk about how image recognition is already exceeding human capability is also showcased in the video."It seems like playtime is over in regards to AI, especially with techniques like deep learning and neural networks," states Altraide. He discusses how social disruption is soon to follow these rapid technological advances.|||
