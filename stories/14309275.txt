Today Instacart operates in 50 markets in the US. Our customers live everywhere from Seattle to Chicago to Miami. But we’re nowhere near done expanding. We’re excited to announce that this year we will be bringing Instacart to over 100 more markets across the US!

Instacart is not just valuable for customers in big cities. In fact, over the last year we’ve seen tremendous demand for Instacart in smaller cities across America.

In Evansville Indiana, for example, we had more new customers in the first week than in the entire first month of our launch in Chicago! Customers and Shoppers in cities like College Station TX, Sarasota FL and Rockford IL are thriving on the Instacart platform too.

With our plans to serve 80% of American households by 2018, we have started our expansion into the next 100 cities in America.

You’ll notice something different about these places: many are outside of major metropolitan areas! Unlike our first launch cities which were chosen for their size, our expansion into cities and towns in the Heartland of America is driven by something entirely different: our partnerships.

As a marketplace, Instacart has official partnerships with many of the best retailers in America. In the last few months alone, we’ve partnered with many new hometown favorite retailers like BevMo!, Sur La Table, Schnucks, Bashas’, Farm Fresh, Shop ‘n Save, Shoppers, 99 Ranch Market and Stater Bros. We have many more exciting retailer partnerships to announce over the next few weeks, so stay tuned.

Where do you live? And when will Instacart be there? Sooner than you think!
