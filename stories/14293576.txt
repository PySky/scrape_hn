1/ As AI helps companies use massive data sets to fuel their growth, it wouldn’t be crazy to think that wars will be waged over data centers the way they have been over oil fields. Learn More on The Economist >

2/ A man sentenced to 6 years in prison claims his right to due process was violated when a judge used a report, generated by a secretive machine learning algorithm, to point to his guilt. Learn More on The New York Times >

3/ If the people building AI systems into all the technology we depend on aren’t representative of the people who make up our society, we’re going to experience a major ethics crisis. To keep that from happening, Melinda Gates and Google’s Chief Scientist of AI are launching a non-profit that gets underrepresented high school students involved in AI. Learn More on Backchannel >

4/ Uber’s long-term survival is hard to imagine unless it finds a way to build or buy a massive fleet of autonomous vehicles. Learn More on The Wall Street Journal >

5/ Las Vegas, Riverside-San Bernardino, and Orlando will feel the effects of job automation more severely than most other cities in the US since they have such a high concentration of food preparation and administrative support jobs. Learn More on The Atlantic >

6/ Government regulators could do major damage to the emerging car industry if they mandate a “severely flawed” communication standard in all future autonomous vehicles. Learn More on Wired >

Until recently, conventional wisdom at hotels dictated that hospitality happens between people. Employee training emphasized conducting face to face and phone interactions with a personal touch.

Guests were expected to pick up the phone when they needed a quick question answered or to even show up at the front desk when their request was more involved.

So, when 24 guests wanted to check out at once, a wait was unavoidable.

4 years ago, we saw that AI could give rise to a better experience for guests.

“What’s the wifi password?”

“What time does the gym close?”

We built an automated guest engagement platform that answered millions of hotel guest questions like the ones above, and eliminated the need for someone to ring the front desk.

The key, however, is in the human impact of an AI platform like ours on the travel world. Staff are now freed up to focus on higher value tasks, answer fewer questions robotically, and feel more human at their jobs.

Today, guests prefer information on-demand. The gap between the guests’ rising informational needs, and the hotel staff’s ability to meet these new expectations is finally closing.

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning will radically change the way we work and live. Machine Learnings covers the most remarkable news in AI, so you’ll feel prepared for the future.|||
