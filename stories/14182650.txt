EdgeX FoundryTM is a vendor-neutral open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation building a common open framework for Industrial IoT edge computing.  The EdgeX platform enables and encourages the rapidly growing community of IoT solutions providers to work together in an ecosystem of interoperable components to reduce uncertainty, accelerate time to market, and facilitate scale.  By enabling the use of existing connectivity standards together with a marketplace of interoperable developer value-add it will simplify development and deployment of IoT solutions in a wide variety of use cases.  The initiative is aligned around a common goal: the simplification and standardization of the foundation for tiered edge computing architectures in the Industrial IoT market while still enabling the ecosystem to provide significant value-added differentiation.|||
