The philosophy of this library is to provide all Bootstrap 4 components for a Svelte app, without needing to use Bootstrap component classes or needing to include Bootstrap's JavaScript.

However, to make using Bootstrap themes easier, this library does not embed Bootstrap styles directly and you will need to include Bootstrap 4 CSS in your page.

The component names and interface are inspired by the reactstrap library for React.

You need to include a link to Bootstrap 4 stylesheet in your page - these components do not include or embed any Bootstrap styles automatically.|||
