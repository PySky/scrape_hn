Last week, when Nvidia announced its new top-end Titan Xp GPU, it also said that it would be releasing macOS drivers for the new card and the company's entire Pascal-based GPU lineup. Today, it has released version 378.05.05.05f01 of its Mac driver, a beta that will allow Macs (and sort-of Macs) to support those cards for the first time.

The driver should support all Pascal-based graphics cards under macOS Sierra, including the GTX 1050, 1050 Ti, 1060, 1070, 1080, and 1080 Ti, as well as the Titan X and Titan Xp. It also supports many older GeForce and Quadro GPUs going all the way back to the GeForce 8000 series.

These drivers are good news for Mac users who want to use the newest, best GPUs, but they shouldn't be taken as a sign that Apple is working to put any Pascal-based GPUs in upcoming Macs. Nvidia has maintained macOS drivers for older Maxwell-based GPUs even though Apple never shipped them in any Macs (every new Mac starting from the 2013 Mac Pro has used Intel's and AMD's GPUs exclusively).

The list of Macs that can officially use these new GPUs is small—just a handful of older Mac Pros with PCI Express slots, at least until Apple puts out new iMacs, MacBook Pros, or Mac Pros with Nvidia GPUs—but unofficially, people use these drivers for all sorts of things. They can enable support for Nvidia GPUs in external Thunderbolt GPU docks, and they're also popular in the "Hackintosh" community as a way to use newer, better GPUs than Apple officially supports inside Mac clones built with standard PC components. These systems violate Apple's license agreement for macOS, but that hasn't kept vibrant online communities from springing up around custom-built "Macs."|||

New drivers support the GTX 1000 series and the new Titan Xp, among others.
