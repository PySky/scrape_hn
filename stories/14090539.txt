Today we have a couple of big announcements to make.

As Digit becomes a more important part of our customers' financial lives, we’ve decided to make a conscious decision about how we want to make money. Too many financial services complicate things by making money doing things not in the best interest of their customers. Charging for Digit will allow us to support our service while making sure we always do what’s right for the customer.

A monthly subscription will cost $2.99. For all existing users, Digit will remain free for the next 100 days.

We are also significantly increasing the Digit Savings Bonus. All customers will now earn a 1% Savings Bonus (up from 0.20%). With the recent introduction of Goalmojis, customers are saving more than ever, and we want to make sure you're earning real rewards for saving with Digit.

We want to give a huge thank you to all of our early users, believers, and fans. You have sparked the savings revolution. We promise to continue building products that make your financial life easier and better.|||
