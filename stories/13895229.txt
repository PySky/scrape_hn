AbbVie Pharmaceuticals, a public company on the New York Stock Exchange (ABBV) and manufacturer of the drug, Vicodin, woke up today to find that their domain name, Vicodin.com, had been seized by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), a branch of the Department of Homeland Security.

Jamie Zoch of DotWeekly reported the change when he noticed the WHOIS data showed a DNS update to ICE’s domain name servers, ns1.seizedservers.com and ns2.seizedservers.com.

This seems to be an unprecedented move, taking over a primary domain name from a public company with no public stories leading up to the possibility of such seizure. It also sounds like it may very well have been a mistake by ICE as part of a bigger seizure. Over 800 domain name were reported to have been moved to ICE’s DNS on March 17th, according to DailyChanges.com.

AbbVie Pharmaceuticals (spun off from Abbott Laboratories) has owned this domain name for the last 10 years, according to a reverse WHOIS search on DomainTools.com, and is the listed owned of the VICODIN® trademark registered in USPTO and WIPO records.

A visit to Vicodin.com today now shows the infamous ICE landing page typically associated with domain names of companies intentionally and knowingly trafficking in counterfeit goods.|||
