One month ago, I graduated from one of the best business schools in Europe (according to rankings at least). I thought about not going to the graduation ceremony. Why? Because my studies were useless.

Well, this was very critical. Actually, things are more complex, they always are. And I actually don’t regret having done my useless school:

First, human relationships are keys. In school, I met amazing friends. This is something a MOOC cannot give you. Creating social links, both personal and professional, is still the main asset of traditional education.

Even more important, you should not care about the sole end result. The journey is much more important, especially in education. Every choice you make, good or bad, is an opportunity to learn valuable lessons. It gets you closer to what you are want to do, to who you are meant to be.

Without doing my school, I probably would have never even thought about learning to code. It is thanks to a project I did during my studies that I discovered the power code gives you. I am not from this world and I am pretty sure I would have missed it.

Now that I have my useless diploma, let’s build something useful with it!|||
