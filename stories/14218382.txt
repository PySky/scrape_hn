You can customize styles.

 Creating text and layer styles takes forever. We did it for you. All you have to do is customize them. 😎

You can resize everything.

 Tab bar too small? Make it bigger. Don’t need that one button? Delete it. 🗜

You can customize symbols.

 Woah, what? Symbols are built using other symbols, so you can override just about anything. Color…text…icons…whatever! 😱

You can test your design system on a phone.

 It only makes sense, right? Because the system is built on styles and symbols, everything stays in sync. Oh, and we already built the style guide for you. Genius. Have a peek. 📱|||
