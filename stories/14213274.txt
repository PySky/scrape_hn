Participants may remain completely anonymous or use their real-life identity, as they prefer. Implementers are not expected to explain their designs: they only have to provide a resulting C code. Attackers are not expected to explain their techniques: they only have to recover and provide the embedded key(s).

Starting from May 15, 2017 on this website, the EU-sponsored ECRYPT-CSA project is organising an open competition on white-box cryptography.

The motivation for initiating the WhibOx contest comes from the growing interest of the industry towards white-box cryptography (most particularly for DRMs and mobile payments) and the obvious difficulty of designing secure solutions in a scientifically valid sense. The conjunction of these phenomena has prompted some companies to develop home-made solutions (with a security relying on the secrecy of the underlying techniques) rather than to rely on academic designs.

In such a context, the competition gives an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to confront their (secretly designed) white-box implementations to state-of-the-art attackers. It also provides attackers and evaluators with new training material.

We hope and believe that new ideas will arise from this contest and that they will have a strong, positive impact on both scientific research and industrial know-how in the field of white-box cryptography.|||
