Now comes the fun part. Start by saying, “Alexa, ask Newton if I’ve got mail.” Your Echo device will reply if you have any new email messages, and who they’re from. Then, Alexa will ask if you want the email checker to read your emails to you. If you reply yes, Alexa will start reading emails. I found, unfortunately, that she would skip over quite a few email messages, saying they were better read in the Newton app. Usually, these were HTML messages, which apparently Alexa can’t read.

Once Alexa has read an email to you, she’ll ask what you want to do with it. Basically, you can do anything you might do in the Newton app itself except reply – mark it as read, delete it, archive the message, mark it as spam, or snooze the email. You can also interrupt Alexa and ask her to read the message again, read the next mail, or read the previous one. When you’re done with the email checker, if Alexa is still reading, just say “Alexa, stop.”

If you want to get a quick update on who just emailed you after your iPhone buzzes, just say, “Alexa ask Newton who just emailed me.”|||
