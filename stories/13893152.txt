Pass in event to be able to call preventDefault Function `processHash` has the following two lines: ``` // since this is a token renewal request in iFrame, we don't need to proceed with the location change. event.preventDefault(); ``` This causes an error, because there is no variable `event`. We need to pass it in to the function in order for the code to work.|||
