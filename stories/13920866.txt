Cloud pricing is subscription based. You are eligible for support and automatic version updates as long as your subscription is active.

When your subscription renews each month, your pricing tier for host products and add-ons is automatically adjusted (as necessary) based on the number of users in your instance.

If you've opted for annual billing for your host product, add-ons are also billed annually. Annual subscriptions for this add-on include a discount (12 months for the price of 10).

If add-on pricing changes after your initial purchase, there's a 60-day grandfathering period during which you can renew based on the old pricing.|||
