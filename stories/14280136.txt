PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio has been updated! See below for release notes.

Pester Context and It blocks are now shown in the Test Explorer window. You can now sort the tests by “Namespace” and “Class” which equate to Describe and Context blocks.

Note: Pester only supports running tests at the Describe level. When you execute a Context or It block, it will actually run all the tests in the Describe block and return only the results of the selected tests.

Fixed an issue where dragging and dropping a PowerShell project into a solution folder would not work.

A configuration option is now available in Tools->Options->PowerShell Tools to reset the PowerShell session before each execution. The PowerShell host process is actually terminated so any loaded DLLs, modules or defined variables will no longer exist in the subsequent sessions. The REPL window is affected but executing commands in the REPL window will not cause the session to reset.

The PowerShell host now follows the current solution path around. When you open a new solution, the PowerShell host will change directory to the solution folder. When reloading of PS Sessions is enabled, before execution, the PowerShell host will change directory back to the solution directory.

Fixed an issue where opening SQL files in a PowerShell project would present a “Value does not fall within the expected range” message box.

Release notes window is now shown after updating PowerShell Tools. Can be disabled in Tools->Options->PowerShell Tools.

PowerShell projects now support the Windows Forms designer and can create forms based on PowerShell script. PowerShell item template is now available to create PowerShell form items.

PowerShell projects now support WPF designer with PowerShell script code behind. PowerShell item template is now available to create PowerShell WPF windows.|||
