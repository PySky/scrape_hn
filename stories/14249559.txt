 What it tries to do: A suit that makes the wearer stronger and helps prevent injury

Superflex is a type of ‘soft’ robot, which can mould itself to the environment or a human body in a way that typical robots can’t. The goal is to make machines that feel and behave more like biological than mechanical systems, and give additional powers to the wearer.

Features: 

 • Battery-powered compressive suit weighs seven pounds 

• Faux ‘muscles’ can withstand 250lb of force
