For the ones who want to express their excessive thanks for my work, I used to have an Amazon wishlist with a list of books, but right now I don't have any interesting books on the list anymore (to anyone who've sent books before: thank you very much, I got 6 books in 6 months). You can always donate something so that I can use it for other stuff, such as Nespresso coffee.|||
