We are happy to announce the release of Cloudron 0.120.0.

For those unaware, Cloudron is a platform that makes it easy to run apps on your server and keep them up-to-date.

Cloudron currently supports storing backups as encryped zipped tarballs on Amazon S3 or on the file system. We have seen many requests from our users to support alternate storage providers (like Backblaze B2), differential backups and different backup formats (plain files instead of tarballs).

To this end, we have reworked Cloudron's backup code so that it is easy to implement the above features. With the new design, it should be easy to add new backup formats and also use backup tools like rclone to upload to various storage providers. We also expect it to be easy to add support for differntial backups using tools like Borg.

The retention period of backups can be configured in the dialog in the settings menu. After the retention period, Cloudron will delete the backups from the storage backend and from it's backup database.

Minio is now supported and listed separately as a new backup storage provider.

We have added an UI to download system logs, mail logs and application logs. Navigate to the support menu, to download the logs.

We have updated Docker to version 17.03.1-ce. Cloudron previously had Docker 1.12.5 which did not support user namespaces very well. With the new version, we should be able to enable user namespaces and readonly rootfs for apps in a future release.|||
