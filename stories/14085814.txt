operating voltage is higher than the

nsulation structure in the operating voltage of the discharge characteristics, the breakdown mechanism and frequency, the impact is not the same

he operation does not cause the effect of wave oscillation, a long time, for the same voltage, the coil will be more severe than the im

operation wave is directly caused by the oil gap breakdown

he small oil cylinder gap thin insulation structure of transformer is more necessary.|||
