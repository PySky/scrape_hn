dwtviz is a library for visualizing the coefficients from the stationary and discrete wavelet transforms.

It uses pywt to perform the transforms, and matplotlib for plotting.

vertically aligns the signal with a heatmap of the coefficients to help the viewer gain an intuition for how the wavelet coefficients relate to the signal.|||
