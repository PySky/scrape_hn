Over the course of Friday the 12th of May we received multiple reports of organizations across multiple verticals being victim to a ransomware attack.   Once infected, the encrypted files contain the file extension “.WNCRYT”.

Victim computers then proceed to display the below message with a demand for $300 to decrypt the files.

The malware is using the MS17-010 exploit to distribute itself. This is a SMB vulnerability with remote code execution options – details: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx . Exploit-code is available on multiple site including this example: https://github.com/RiskSense-Ops/MS17-010/blob/master/exploits/eternalblue/ms17_010_eternalblue.rb

This exploit is also known as the Equation Group’s ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers a couple of weeks ago.

With MS17-010, the attacker can use just one exploit to get remote access with system privileges, meaning both steps (Remote Code Execution +Local Privilege Escalation combined) are using just one bug in SMB protocol. Analyzing the exploit-code in Metasploit, a famous tool used for hacking, the exploit uses  ‘KI_USER_SHARED_DATA’ which has a fixed memory address (0xffdff000 on 32 bit Windows) to copy payload to and transfer control to it later.

By remotely gaining control over victim PC with system privileges without any user action, the attacker can spray this malware in local network by having control over one system inside this network (get control over all system which is not fixed and affected by this vulnerability) and that one system will spread the ransomware in this case all over the Windows systems vulnerable and not patched to MS17-010.

By using command-line commands, the Volume Shadow copies and backups are removed:

Cmd /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete & bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no & wbadmin delete catalog -quiet

File-size of the ransomware is 3.4 MB (3514368 bytes)

Ransomware is writing itself into a random character folder in the ‘ProgramData folder with the file name of “tasksche.exe’ or in C:\Windows\ folder with the file-name ‘mssecsvc.exe’ and ‘tasksche.exe’.

Ransomware is granting full access to all files by using the command:
