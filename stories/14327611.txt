We are working on a forum-like project where we have to show the answers in a feed just like Quora.

The ranking should converge toward an ordering that is independent of the amount of attention an answer has gotten. This means that sometimes highly upvoted answers will rank below answers with fewer upvotes. As usual, the quality of a writer's previous answers will provide a hint to us about how a new answer should rank, but once we have enough votes on an answer, those become the most important signal for ranking. All of this will mean that new answers can now get to the top very quickly if they are the best.

TABLES First - understand a post is a post and user / page / company / group is a content creator - all 4 can be treated the same, the cavat being presenting a different layout for each type of content creator. That said, I'll call a content creator a user for the sake of keeping the code short and clean.

Now How to design the best database architecture to rank the feed effectively?|||
