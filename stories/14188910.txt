YI HALO makes production easier than ever for VR filmmakers. It has 17 4K unit cameras, including an optimally-placed Up camera, to capture immersive scenes that transport viewers. Derin Turner, Production Director at VR Playhouse, noted “This camera and Jump ranks as one of the best and easiest pieces of equipment and platform to use on the market.”

Creators also get more control and flexibility with the YI HALO. At less than 8 pounds, the YI HALO can be transported anywhere, and doesn’t limit them when they’re trying to capture a tricky shot. The internal battery lasts for 100 minutes of continuous shooting, so creators can get "one more take." Filmmakers also love the YI HALO Android app that doubles as a remote control and live preview tool.

Filmmakers’ visions come together via the Jump Assembler, which ensures seamless, artifact-free stitches that are ready in a few short hours. The YI HALO camera has been built to natively work with the Assembler. “The camera combined with the stitching algorithm is the best 360 video solution in the industry," said Jay Spangler, Executive VR Producer for Two Bit Circus.

YI HALO will go on sale this summer, with units available today to select creators. Interested creators can find more info on the YI HALO website. To see more of what the camera can do, check out this footage (best viewed in VR).|||
