In most of Android application we need to make dynamic Android view as per requirement that’s why i come with json2view library which is a simple library that can convert a compatible JSON file to an Android view so you can load dynamically the view in your Android app without the need to update the APK.

This removes the hassle of updating, re-compiling and uploading the APK to Google Play every-time you want to make small or big changes in the UI.

You can parse any xml through the json2view library to create a JSON that will be used at runtime to dynamically generate the Android UI using native code. This JSON can be hosted anywhere on the internet (your own server, Dropbox, Github Pages etc.) and can be fetched in your app at any point you decide.

Note: Runtime creation of a view without the precompiled version of xml in apk (res/layout), especially for highly complex layouts, can be a potential latency issue.

The input JSON has 3 fields for every view we want to create :

eg. JSON to create a TextView with textSize : 12sp and text : “Hello TellMeHow!”

You can use ConvertXML2JSON.groovy (from ./utils) to convert any android xml to json2view valid JSON file (the script needs further development to create a valid JSON for every case)

 try :

from the root folder of the project

create and attach view in the specific Parent (created from xml)
