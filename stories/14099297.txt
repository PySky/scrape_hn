Uber is officially in the market for patents. You have an opportunity to make your submissions from April 24, 2017 through May 23, 2017.

Sellers are instructed to provide patent family details and a price they are willing to accept for each family or portfolio. Once the submission window closes, Uber will review the submissions and provide sellers with our decisions by July 7, 2017. For those portfolios we agree to purchase, deals will be completed by August 22, 2017. Uber reserves the right to not transact with anyone for any reason at any point in the process.

Below are the documents that you should review and download. We encourage you to speak with an attorney before you make a submission.|||
