As Product Managers, our daily routine involves reviewing multiple dashboards and extracting insights.

And as the organization grows, so do the number of metrics to track as well as the data size.

This part of extracting insights involves extensive data crunching and complex math, which is time-consuming and has a huge scope for automation. The part of filtering which metric to track and take action is even more tedious.

The larger organizations have the luxury of hiring a team of data analysts to delegate this work, but smaller businesses can’t afford it.

With the evolution of AI-powered technologies and researchers already reaching ANI stage, there is a disruption waiting to happen in the analytics space. Indeed some analytics tools like Google Analytics and Mixpanel are working on bringing these automated insights capabilities.

Following is a product deck with a hypothetical solution — Dexa, a chatbot to be precise, to solve this problem based on AI.

Dexa is a conversational user interface to bring automated actions on insights based on analytics data to life.

Note: I use CleverTap extensively, and most of the terminology and screenshots in the presentation are inspired from CleverTap.
