Here is how WordPress Codex define WordPress Plugin:

A WordPress Plugin is a program, or a set of one or more functions, written in the PHP scripting language, that adds a specific set of features or services to the WordPress weblog, which can be seamlessly integrated with the weblog using access points and methods provided by the WordPress Plugin Application Program Interface (API).

A plugin must contain a file with meta information which tells WordPress what it is and how to handle the plugin within your website. Plugins can be installed, deleted, activated, and inactivated.
