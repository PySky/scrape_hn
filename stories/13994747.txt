Accidents, disease and ageing are among the destructive factors that can leave us unable to walk: today, across the world, around 65m people require a wheelchair to help with their mobility.

But while many people with lower-body conditions are at peace with their physical limitations (we are all still just people, after all), it remains a dream for many to ‘walk’ again, to speak to people at eye-level, and to be able to broach physical obstructions, like stairs, with ease.

The idea of a robot that could provide assisted walking is particularly impactful for those who don’t have the upper-body mobility needed to control a traditional wheelchair.|||

And prices for exoskeletons are coming down.
