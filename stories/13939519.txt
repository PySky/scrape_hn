Over the last few years, we have helped close to 200,000 creators learn and share useful content across 90+ hardware platforms. Today, we’re upping the ante with a collection of software tools that enable our community to better design, prototype, and produce both Maker and enterprise-grade projects alike.

To accomplish this, we are partnering with circuito.io, Upverter, and a number of other web-based tools to introduce a streamlined hardware development workflow, all within Hackster — no downloads, no installations, no hassles! These intuitive, fully integrated platforms take the hard out of hardware by making the prototyping process easy, efficient, and expeditious.

First, circuito.io’s drag and drop software allows you to simply select components you’d like to use to build your device, and then generates a schematic complete with a step-by-step wire diagram and downloadable code example.

Next, Upverter is a full-featured, in-browser PCB tool that eliminates the tedious and repetitive tasks often associated with creating boards. Its responsive, collaborative environment lets you and your peers make edits on the same designs, automatically saving and updating them in real-time. Upverter’s schematic capture and PCB layout editors are always synced, reducing translational error and time, while its in-design search makes it easy to browse a library of over 1.4 million parts.

On our quest to revolutionize how Makers and developers build, connect and deploy hardware, expect to see more apps like Resin.io, Blynk, and Microsoft MakeCode added in coming weeks.
