Here's a look at some of the work created for Rogue One: A Star Wars story by BLIND (Star Wars: The Force Awakens)

The work is respectful of the Star Wars legacy and returns to a simpler time, reflected in the simpler graphics. When I say simpler, I'm referring the the simple colour palettes, usually one key colour and devoid of shading and tone.

The screen graphics look like they could be from the 80s, which I love. The monitors that they appear on, themselves add to this nostalgia. It is still a very analogue environment.

It's as if BLIND had cherry picked the best parts of the original Stars Wars UI design and breathed new life into them. Choosing some of the more unique and memorable screens from the original films and elaborating on that.

This is really beautiful work, congrats to the guys at BLIND! Check it out!|||
