Do you need to migrate your VMs within Azure from Azure Service Manager to Azure Resource Manager?

Maybe you need to clone one of your Azure VMs fast and easily?

Perhaps you need to create a clone of your VM (to be used like a snapshot) while you patch or upgrade components of your server and avoid having issues with a risky upgrade?

If you answered YES to any of these, then the Azure VM Cloner (AVMC) is the tool for you.

AVMC connects to your Microsoft Azure subscriptions and allows you to view all of your virtual machines within Azure.

You simply select the VM you wish to clone, then click NEXT.

If you have any additional disks attached, you will prompted if you wish to clone those disks too.

Next you choose the target subscription, the target resource group and the target location, then click NEXT.

Now choose the destination virtual network and subnet.

Select Destination VM name and size and select Post Completion Options

The Azure VM Cloner (AVMC) will now start the cloning process. The console window as shown above shows the status of the cloning activity.

The console window continues to display the output of the cloning of your Azure VMs.

Once completed, you will receive an email showing the status of the cloning.

That’s all there is to it. A simple and easy way to clone your Azure VMs.
