U.S. officials have released an image of an object found in the suitcase of an American man as he attempted to board a flight from Toronto to Chicago on April 6.

The discovery of the object, in the luggage of Joseph Galaska, caused hours of delays for passengers on the same flight at Toronto's Pearson International Airport.

In a tweet on Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection called the device a "mock IED" or improvised explosive device. The device itself was covered in colourful wires and electronic components.

U.S. officials said in a statement on April 6 that the object was swabbed for explosives "with a negative result."

Meanwhile, other passengers booked on Galaska's flight were delayed by more than eight hours at Pearson and were moved in shuttle buses to an isolation area before being re-screened along with their baggage.

Galaska was charged with mischief following the discovery of the object. He appeared in a Toronto courtroom on April 7 and is due back in court on April 18.

Speaking to ABC's WISN in Milwaukee, Galaska's wife, Maria Silva, said the object is a novelty alarm clock purchased while on vacation in Brazil.|||
