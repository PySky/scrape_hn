Top executives and decision makers say the widespread application of artificial intelligence is just around the corner, and that they are "eager" to outsource tasks such as accounting and scheduling to software, according to a new survey from PwC. Consumers, meanwhile, by and large do not fear this future, PwC says.

Why it matters: There are more than 1.3 million accountants in the United States, earning a median salary of more than $68,000. But 69% of the executives said they are "eager" to outsource their accounting needs to a digital assistant. A majority "believe AI's potential to boost business productivity, inform strategy, and generate growth outweighs the potential downside of employment concerns," PwC said.
