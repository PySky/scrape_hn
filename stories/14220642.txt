Inspired by couchdb. Damien Katz mentioned about being able to "touch your data" back in a 2009 presentation.

“I was so excited when I first started testing it out. Because a big goal with CouchDB was that you would be able to feel like you could touch your data, like it was right there in your hand. There’re certain tools where you have this responsiveness and you don’t feel like there’s all these layers between you that are obfuscating what you’re trying to get at.”

That quote can be seen on http://blakesmith.me/2009/10/12/agile-and-play-understanding-the-value.html.

Couchdb was an erlang stack with javascript stored procedures (business logic, validation, map-reduce secondary indexes) and stored your data in json format.

It had distributed multi-master sync which meant not having support for multi-document transactions.

For my usecase, having the latter was required.

And so protostuffdb was born with the goal of being able to touch your data (like couchdb) while supporting multi-document transactions.

This stack is c/c++ with java stored procedures and stores your data in protostuff binary format.

Both validation and secondary indexes are implemented declaratively using a custom DSL on top of .proto files, where the schema of your data is defined. These files are compiled by fbsgen-ds.

I should add that both leveldb and hyperleveldb are interoperable, which means you can simply copy your leveldb data and transfer in to another machine with hyperleveldb.
