Glimpse is a small team at Microsoft with big ambition: bringing web diagnostics to the next level. Our main goal is to help you spend less time debugging and more time building products you’re proud of. Glimpse can diagnose both the client and server side of your web apps, seamlessly. It’s got the server-side information you won’t ﬁnd in any other diagnostic tools.

Glimpse is free and your support means everything. We’re excited for you to try it. If you find any issues, let us know on our GitHub repo.|||
