Best fishing trip I've had in a long time. I caught 3 large browns, one of which was about 27". This was a really fun day. I was supposed to fish the Dolores River today, but the river was blown out and super chocolaty. So as I was driving home, I saw some small lakes along the river. They were old beaver dams that were converted into small lakes for the public to fish. They are stocked with rainbows, but have some large browns in them. I decided to streamer fish with my sage method and an intermediate sink tip line. I had to let the streamers sink for a long time though as the lakes are super deep and the larger trout were sitting on the bottom. 



I was fishing two of my flies this time. A black monster bugger, and my jointed green dragon. Both preformed really well, and caught a bunch of fish. I caught 2 fish on the jointed green dragon, and 3 on the monster bugger. If you tie flies, you can find these videos here...

Dolores is a small town in southern Colorado, and its really beautiful there. Beautiful mountains, small creeks, and a few lakes and ponds. An outdoor enthusiast's playground.

This video is at a higher quality than most of my videos due to being able to borrow my fathers camera this trip. Its the Sony A6000. Not badly priced for all the features and quality of image. The majority of my talking to the camera was filmed on this. If you like this camera and want to buy it, check it out here, I found the same bundle my father got, but for about $200 less than he payed. https://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Mirrorle...|||
