Given two 16-bit positive values stored in 32-bit integer variables, find the product using the 8-bit multiply operator that that takes two 8-bit numbers and returns a 16-bit value.



 The idea is to divide the given 16-bit numbers (say m and n) into 8-bit numbers first (say & ). Now the problem is reduced to something similar to multiplication of a 2-digit number with another 2-digit number. For example,

 Â 

 



In the solution below, we are using unsigned char to represent a 8-bit number and unsigned short to represent 16-bit number.

Output: 

 

 23472 in binary is 0101101110110000

 2600 in binary is 0000101000101000
