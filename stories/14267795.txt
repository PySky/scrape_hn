Real tours in industry, I am told, are much more challenging than ours for everyone but the most popular acts. Iâ€™ve heard war stories from friends about hitting 42 cities in 45 days with 7 people and their gear crammed into one van, getting one motel room for the entire band each night, $10 per diems that had them eating potato chips for lunch, or getting all their gear stolen. To quote my friend Kyle, "You come back from tour completely drained and demoralized, and yet somehow excited to do the whole thing again the next day." With this little taste of the "road life" and booking our mini-tour, I noticed how important networking is to the whole process:

When independent bands are trying to get booked at venues, especially away from home, it helps to have friends who are a local band and know the scene. It helps even more if those friends mesh with you musically, and you can approach the venue with a cohesive ticket for the night you are asking about.

Take our show in Portland, for example. Instead of diving into the lengthy research process described above, one of our singers Hannah, who is from Oregon, reached out to a childhood friend in a local band called Space Shark, and we were able to book our gig at Kelly's Olmpian faster than you could say polymetre.

By contrast, even reaching out with friends in a local LA band, we indeed did have to go through the email saga (partially since there are so many bands in LA and getting gigs is very competitive) and we ended up having to plan a house party with them instead. That party was really great too, but likely resulted in less revenue and less exposure than a venue show would have. The economics of it all need to add up a bit better when you are planning a real professional tour. As you can imagine, the sheer difficulty of planning a good tour is why there are professionals who often manage bands' tours for them, and their services can really be worth it even at smaller scales.|||
