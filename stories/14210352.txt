Nobel Prize in Literature winner, Professor Wole Soyinka, has joined South Africa's University of Johannesburg (UJ) to head up the institution's efforts in "Africanizing and Decolonizing Knowledge".

His move to South Africa as a Visiting Professor at the University of Johannesburg is in keeping with his promise to denounce his American residency should Donald Trump win elections in 2016.



 Prof. Wole Soyinka and Professor Ihron Rensburg, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Johannesburg.

“He (Prof. Soyinka) has been and continues to be associated with some of the best Universities in the world. UJ’s commitment to decolonisation and the Africanisation of knowledge has led to significant dialogues at the Institution. These conversations provide the University the opportunity to ask searching questions about our African identity and our role in nurturing the New Africa, and the future of our University. Prof Soyinka, a high profile academic and social influencer whose work, sentiments, and political positionality is taken very seriously in Africa, and across the world will bring a new dimension to this discourse,” said Prof Alex Broadbent, Executive Dean, Faculty of Humanities at UJ in a statement announcing Prof. Soyinka's appointment.

Prof. Broadbent added that Prof. Soyinka will be bringing the work of the Soyinka Foundation to partner with UJ as well.

“As a UJ Distinguished Visiting Professor, Prof Soyinka will play a highly visible representative role in his global engagements away from Johannesburg, thus furthering UJ’s brand recognition and reach." concluded Prof. Broadbent.|||
