In active development since 2012, and totalling almost 39,000 lines of code, the libraries address concepts related to many displines, from animation, generative design, data analysis / validation / visualization with SVG and WebGL, interactive installations, 2d / 3d geometry, digital fabrication, voxel modeling, rendering, linked data graphs & querying, encryption, OpenCL computing etc.

Many of the thi.ng projects (especially the larger ones) are written in a literate programming style and include extensive documentation, diagrams and tests, directly in the source code on GitHub. Each library can be used individually. All projects are licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.|||

thi.ng is an open source collection of 20+ computational design tools for Clojure & Clojurescript: generative design, data visualization, digital fabrication, linked data, graph processing and more...
