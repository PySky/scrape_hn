Visualization and "audibilization" of 15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes.

Sorts random shuffles of integers, with both speed and the number of items adapted to each algorithm's complexity.

The algorithms are: selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, radix sort (LSD), radix sort (MSD), std::sort (intro sort), std::stable_sort (adaptive merge sort), shell sort, bubble sort, cocktail shaker sort, gnome sort, bitonic sort and bogo sort (30 seconds of it).
