As a freelance web developer and product maker, I have to constantly switch back and forth between editing code and mockups, managing to-do lists, executing command lines, checking email and Twitter, and analyzing user behavior. This requires doing lots of repetitive actions all the time. Launch the code or image editor and open project files. Open the web browser and navigate to a project board in Trello. Launch Terminal and type commands in it. Everything is accessed in different ways and stored in different places. That turns the workflow into a real mess, especially when working on multiple projects. I thought that I could dramatically improve my productivity by gathering everything I need for my work in a single place and organizing them by projects and workflows. Everything would have a right context and finding something I need in my work wouldn’t turn into a nightmare anymore. That’s how I came up with Freeter—the app that does just that.

In this article, I’ll show how I boosted my productivity with Freeter with an example of a workflow I have when I work on it. Hopefully, this will help you see how you could enhance your workflow too.|||
