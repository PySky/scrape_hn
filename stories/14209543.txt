Can’t insert the MP4 files to PowerPoint on Mac? That happens and as common, not only to you! An MP4 file is a very complicated format that can be encoded in various ways and your PowerPoint just won’t be able to recognize all of them. Actually, there is a smarter way to get rid of the incompatibility issues quickly. If PowerPoint doesn’t let you insert a MP4 video file, you can fix the problem in a few steps and a modest amount of time. The simplest way to fix this situation is to take these three steps, which are described in this article.

When you inserting MP4 video file to PowerPoint, you may get some errors like “Cannot play back the file. The format is not supported” and “PowerPoint couldn’t insert a movie from the selected file etc. Why can’t insert MP4 into PPT successfully? The main reason: version conflict and compatibility problem. MP4 is a popular container format, which has different codecs. Some codecs of MP4 are not supported by PowerPoint. And some old PowerPoint versions also can’t accept MP4 format well. You can take a look at PowerPoint supported formats.

Video:  In PowerPoint 2013 and later, and in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac, for the best video playback experience, we recommend that you use .mp4 files encoded with H.264 video (a.k.a. MPEG-4 AVC) and AAC audio. In PowerPoint 2010, we recommend that you use .wmv files.

Audio:  We recommend using .m4a files encoded with AAC audio. In PowerPoint 2010, we recommend that you use .wav or .wma files.

These and other common file formats are listed in the tables below.

*Only PowerPoint 2013 and later. The 32-bit version of PowerPoint 2010 can play an .mp4 or .mov file only if the computer has a QuickTime Player installed. (Read Download QuickTime for Windows, on the Apple site, for more information.)

**Adobe Flash isn’t available in Office on a Windows RT PC.
