40-year-old American Richard Dabate said that in 2015, he saw an intruder enter his home and use his gun to shoot his wife, Connie Dabate, to death.

But the victim’s Fitbit recorded movements for more than an hour after the attack supposedly took place, contradicting her husband’s claims.

Now Connecticut authorities have charged Mr Dabate with murder, tampering with physical evidence and making false statements.

And they’re using Fitbit data in court as evidence.

Today data is playing an huge role in our lives, whether we like it or not.

Most apps, like Facebook, Twitter and Gmail, track your phone’s GPS movements unless you opt out.

With nearly every app on your smartphone tracking your movements, you don’t even need a Fitbit for a faceless US company to know exactly where you are.

While this might creep you out – and indeed, we often write about the dangers of data – today’s news is a great example of how data can also be used to uphold your liberty.

Ultimately data isn’t either good or bad, it’s who’s using it and how that matters.|||
