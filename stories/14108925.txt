Cloud Player is a study project created at HTW Berlin by

We created the Cloud Player to get started with Angular2. We were also interessted in the HTML5 audio api. Also we were missing a native desktop SoundCloud player. SoundCloud is providing a nice API to get access to their data. This is why we decided to build a audio player and use SoundCloud as the data source.

We optimised the player to work on all major platforms like Smartphone, Tablet and Desktop PCs.

By using a service worker the application is cached on your device it is not downloaded every time you start the Cloud Player. The Web App Manifest allows you to install the Cloud Player on your Android Homescreen

Thanks to the new chrome mobile session API you can control the Cloud Player from your Android notification tray and lock screen.

Electron allows us to ship the player as a native desktop application. You can install the native desktop Cloud Player on your Mac or Windows PC and control it from your keyboard media keys (play/pause, next/previous track).

We are neither related to SoundCloud nor was this build on behalf of SoundCloud|||
