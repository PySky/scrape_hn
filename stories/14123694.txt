Digital stalking is rampant in this day and age. What is digital stalking? Well… It might be best to imagine yourself entering your favorite store. Except, before you enter, you have to fill out a ‘form’. The ‘form’ asks many questions. What’s your age? What’s your gender? What store were you last in? What are your main interests? What’s your race? How did you get here? Why are you here? When were you last here? How many times have you been here? Where do you live?

This is what essentially what happens when you visit most websites, and use their services. Why?

Because in order to use a website’s service, you must agree to their ‘form’, their Terms and Conditions.

But who reads a website’s Terms and Conditions? I know I don’t. In fact I don’t know anyone who reads them. But…

Did you know Facebook can use your photos at their whim? Did you know that they can use your photos for advertising? Did you know that they can keep your photos even if you delete them? Did you know that they are tracking your location with bluetooth, GPS, and Wifi? And that’s just Facebook…

Sure they provide a free service that’s pretty awesome. But is all of this ok?

This is why I made a VPN service. I made it because I want to limit and control the information about me in cyberspace. Your digital footprints are close to permanent. Your digital footprints have equivalence to Buzz Aldrin’s Moon footprints.

You have the choice to limit and control your digital history.
