In his new book, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, Harari examines what might happen to the world when these old myths are coupled with new godlike technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. What will happen to democracy if and when Google and Facebook come to know our likes and our political preferences better than we know them ourselves? What will happen to the welfare state when computers push humans out of the job market and create a massive new “useless class”? How might Islam, Christianity and Judaism handle genetic engineering? Will Silicon Valley end up producing new religions, rather than just novel gadgets?
