Artificial intelligence (A.I.) and deep learning are revolutionizing computer vision (ex: self-driving cars), human speech understanding (ex: Alexa/Siri/Google Now), and language translation (ex: Google Translate) - and are now poised to transform the genomics field. A biophysics PhD candidate and SIGF Bio-X fellow at Stanford University is considering a series of articles that will narrate key developments - would the LinkedIn community be interested in reading them? LinkedIn traffic will have the final say.

Johnny Israeli is a biophysics PhD candidate and a SIGF Bio-X fellow at Stanford University. He develops deep learning for genomics, focusing on protein-DNA interactions. Johnny created the DragoNN toolkit to teach modeling and interpretation of genomic data with deep learning (http://kundajelab.github.io/dragonn/). The DragoNN workshops have been presented in major institutions, including Stanford, UCSF, CSHL, and the Broad Institute. Working with Prof. Anshul Kundaje, Johnny transformed deep learning for genomics from idea to usable framework, mentored dozens of students, and expanded the field through workshops and classes. He will debut a 2-hour presentation and interactive workshop with Nvidia's Deep Learning Institute at its 2017 GTC conference with the goal of jump starting the deep learning for genomics wave. You can follow him on LinkedIn for high-level overviews and insights, and on twitter @johnny_israeli for more technical bits on a weekly basis.|||
