I'll try to summarize a few of my key interpretations of the trends, having now processed the entire discussion.  Sincere apologies in advance if I've (a) misinterpreted a theme, (b) skipped your favorite them, or (c) conflated concepts.  If any of these are the case, well, please post your feedback in the HackerNews thread associated with this post :-)

 

 First, grouped below are some of the Desktop themes, with some fuzzy, approximate "weighting" by the number of pertinent discussions/mentions/vehemence.

Ladies and gentlemen, again, a most sincere "thank you", from the Ubuntu community to the HackerNews community.  We value openness -- open source code, open design, open feedback -- and this last week has been a real celebration of that openness for us.  We appreciate the work and effort you put into your comments, and we hope to continue our dialog throughout our future together, and most importantly, that Ubuntu continues to serve your needs and occasionally even exceed your expectations ;-)

 

 Cheers,
