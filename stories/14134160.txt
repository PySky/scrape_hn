The globe of economic complexity dynamically maps out the entire world production of goods to create an economic landscape of countries around the globe.This project was built with WebGL and needs it to run properly, your current web browser is not compatible.See get.webgl.org to fix this issue or enjoy the following teaser:

The globe of economic complexity dynamically maps out the entire world production of goods to create an economic landscape of countries around the globe.



 For any given country, The Atlas shows which products are produced and exported; The Atlas can then use this information to suggest products a country could begin manufacturing in order to fuel economic growth. 

It is available at: The Globe is built upon The Atlas of Economic Complexity, a powerful interactive tool that enables users to visualize a countryâ€™s total trade, track how these dynamics change over time and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide.For any given country, The Atlas shows which products are produced and exported; The Atlas can then use this information to suggest products a country could begin manufacturing in order to fuel economic growth.It is available at: http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu
