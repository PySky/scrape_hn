Intel announced its acquisition of Israeli startup Mobileye, which makes chips and software for self-driving cars. Nvidia announced the latest generation of a system intended to speed up machine learning, which is necessary for artificial intelligence.

Both were driven by “specialized computing,” that is, the transforming of specific software tasks into physical silicon chips instead of depending on an...|||

Microprocessors got smaller, faster and more power-efficient, but as they reach their physical limitations, chip architecture is driving performance gains.
