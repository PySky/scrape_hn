Bad Choices is a book all about faster and slower ways of tackling everyday problems that aims to show how thinking in such terms can lead to better decisions. In doing so, the book's cast of characters—mostly humans this time, but some critters and plants as well—introduce you to the topic of algorithmic thinking through twelve vignettes and sixty-five illustrations.

I'm excited to share that we have an official release date: April 4, 2017. And a publisher! Viking (Penguin Random House) will be the book's North American home and John Murray (Hachette) will be the book's UK and Commonwealth home. It's been such a pleasure to have worked so closely with both houses.

I'm grateful to everyone who has engaged with Bad Arguments and Bad Choices over the past three years. I hope you enjoy this new book.|||
