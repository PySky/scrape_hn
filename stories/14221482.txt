Paragon Initiative has written a compatibility shim for libsodium in PHP. Their random_compat is one of the most downloaded and depended upon shims in PHP, which brought cryptographically-secure random number and byte generation to versions of PHP before 7.0. libsodium will be available natively in PHP 7.2 and this shim similarly brings use of the upcoming features to older versions of PHP.



Given that PHP 5.6 will be officially supported until 2019 and that many hosts and businesses are slow to upgrade, it will be years until PHP's libraries, packaged applications, and frameworks can depend on features present PHP 7.2 or higher. Funding this audit will allow these projects to increase their security sooner, rather than much later.



The code is written, but needs to be independently audited before it can be fully released and used. From speaking with the author, Scott Arciszewski, the audit is estimated to cost at least $40,000. With more funds, we can get a more thorough audit of the code and of PHP, itself. Given transaction fees and such, I'm looking for at least $45,000 and no more than $90,000 to make this happen. Leftover funds will be refunded if possible. If not possible, I'll make sure they get donated to an appropriate charity. My first thought is the Electronic Frontier Foundation.



Once enough funds are collected, I'll contact one of the handful of firms with both security and PHP experience to carry out the audit. I'll work with Scott to ensure that we're testing the right things and that the audit is exhaustive. James Denaro of Cipherlaw has agreed to escrow the funds and will take care of disbursing payments to the auditing firm. And, of course, I'll keep you, the backers, up-to-date on our progress.



Thanks!
