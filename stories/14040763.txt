The Internet of Things is developing at a rapid pace, thanks in part to an explosion in the availability of small, inexpensive computing hardware. IoT prototyping kits and development boards combine microcontrollers and processors with wireless chips and other components in a pre-built, ready-to-program package.

They come in nearly infinite configurations, from tiny battery-powered chips that chirp intermittently over Bluetooth to credit card-sized computers with USB power supplies and high-bandwidth Wi-Fi radios. Whatever the needs of your project or product, there's sure to be a board that fits your exact requirements.
