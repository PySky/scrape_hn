YouTube has increased the number of women in its ranks from 24 percent to nearly 30 percent since Susan Wojcicki took over the Google-owned video service in 2014.

“Clearly, we and other companies still have a lot of work to do,” the CEO wrote in an op-ed for Vanity Fair.

For context, women make up 31 percent of Google, according to Google’s latest diversity report. That’s only one percentage point higher than what Google reported in 2014. That suggests YouTube is increasing its gender diversity at a faster clip than Google. Caveat: Google’s latest stat is from July so that may not accurately compare.

Wojcicki wrote that solving unfair treatment and harassment is “not rocket science.”

“Fortunately, there is a solution that has been proved to address gender discrimination in all its forms, both implicit and explicit: hiring more women,” she wrote.

Her piece referenced recent allegations of harassment and gender discrimination at Uber and Tesla and discussed ways to better support women and other underrepresented employees at tech companies.

We’ve asked YouTube for more statistics on gender and ethnic diversity and will update if they respond.|||

The company has made gains since Susan Wojcicki joined as CEO.
