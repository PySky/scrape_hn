One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day, reports Tad Friend of The New Yorker in the article, "The God Pill: Silicon Valley's quest for eternal life." Most check out well before what is considered the maximum age of 115, and some of them could afford to keep going far longer, if only science would allow it.

The urge to combat aging, especially among the affluent, is an old one, but new technological breakthroughs can make the prospect seem tantalizingly close.

Friend joins Nobel Prize-winning scientists, icons of the entertainment industry such as Goldie Hawn and Moby, and tech billionaires like Google co-founder Sergey Brin, for the launch of the National Academy of Medicine's Grand Challenge in Health Longevity, which will distribute $25 million as part of its endeavors to, as one doctor puts it, "end aging forever."|||

The super rich are investing in new ways to make death optional.
