Google will pay €306m (£259m) to settle a tax dispute in Italy and end a criminal investigation into whether it avoided paying the full amount on its revenues in the country for more than a decade.

The agreement resolves a series of disputes including a criminal probe that saw police accuse Google of booking around €1bn of revenues from Italy in Ireland between 2009 and 2013.

The sum, announced on Thursday, also closes other disputes dating between 2002 and 2015. The company said the agreement is in addition to taxes already paid in Italy over the period.

The payment that Italy has secured is significantly higher than the £130m that Google agreed to pay the Treasury last year for a decade of underpaid taxes, and is the latest crackdown from Europe. George Osborne, the chancellor at the time, was criticised for letting Google off easy.|||
