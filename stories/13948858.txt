THE city government released two sets of standards on the booming bike sharing industry yesterday to hear what the public thinks.

The proposals — one on the sector’s service and one on shared bikes’ quality — are co-published by the city’s quality watchdog and Shanghai Bicycle Industry Association.

Major bike sharing operators, and manufacturers including Mobike and ofo participated, in the drafting, though the standards are not compulsory.

Safety requirements include: bike users being from 1.45 to 1.95 meters tall; a shared bike being scrapped after three years of use; and bike sharing hot lines available day and night.

The standards state for every 1,000 shared bikes, there should be at least five maintenance staffers to manage and maintain the bikes.

Guo Jianrong, secretary general with the association, told Shanghai Daily that many bike sharing companies had not reached the standards yet.

According to the association, there are some 574,000 shared bikes in the city. “The growth is very rapid, which urges us to have standards to guide on launching new bikes and regulate behaviors of the companies and users.”
