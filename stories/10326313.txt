Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak joined comedians Jimmy Fallon and Seth Rogen on Friday for a little game of "True Confessions." Each contestant had to read a statement and then get interrogated by the other two to determine if it's real.

No, Seth Rogen did not do mushrooms with Wolf Blitzer, but Wozniak and Steve Jobs did get robbed at gunpoint outside a pizza store.

In the game, Fallon and Rogen were questioning Wozniak's claim that "Steve Jobs and I were once robbed at gun point outside a pizza parlor."

The first fact that made Fallon and Rogen disbelieve Wozniak's story was his pizza order: pepperoni.

"In those days," Wozniak responded with a laugh. 'This is Steve Zero. Before Apple."

Wozniak continues that he was in the car with Steve Jobs — a Dodge Dart, he remembers after much questioning — when the robber approached with a gun.

Rogen didn't believe the tale, but Wozniak continued to elaborate.

The robber wanted to steal a Blue Box phone that Wozniak had, but didn't know how to use it so he left Wozniak his name and phone number.

It sounds like a wild lie, but Wozniak has told the story before. In an interview with Dan Lyons in 2011, Wozniak told a longer version of the gun point robbery:
