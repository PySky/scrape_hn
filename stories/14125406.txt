Sienna is a playground for our bots. It uses peerjs to allow anyone to distribute computation.

You can use this to do some Monte Carlo, function-space exploration, or whatever has high compute, medium memory, low communication needs.

By using Evolution Strategy you can optimize your deep learning reinforcement learning parameters while having low communication needs.

The pages are static html with javascript.

If you are using a recent browser with javascript enabled you are probably running a master node now.

To run it on your own it needs a peerjs server (and STUN/TURN server(s)) to put the peers in relation which you can either host or use a cloud service for.

To launch a new slave just have it visit your slave webpage, and it will use all its CPUs for the task given by the master.

Your billion CPUs cluster, and the general AI which comes with it, is just one "OK siri go to this website" radio-ad away.|||
