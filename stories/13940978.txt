The internet has definitely changed the way we run a business. These days, online marketplaces offer a whole new world of opportunities and standards to wholesalers, retailers, and innovative enthusiasts. Taking the right steps, these can become a flourishing business venture for merchants, offering their products for sale. E-commerce platforms let smaller vendors contend in the competitive retail field, as well as offer an easy way for larger sellers to use numerous advantages of marketplace platforms.

eMarketer estimates that global retail sales will reach $27.7 trillion in 2020, even if annual rates of growth will slow down over the next several years. During this period Asia-Pacific is expected to double its sales and reach $2.725 trillion by 2020, remaining the largest retail e-commerce market (products and services market sectors). North America will remain the second largest regional e-commerce market, after China, and experience a constant double-valued growth in the next few years, resulting from current digital buyers, coverage of new market segments, and an increase in m-commerce sales.

The general key to growing one of the top online marketplaces is: high-quality vendors draw in more customers, while a growing client base attracts more vendors. However, how to get inside this circular flow? Are there any rules of becoming the best marketplace to sell online? – Well, in fact, there are.

These days, neither of articles/books/notes about marketplaces can do without mentioning Amazon. Today it is the largest online marketplace in the USA that sells all types of goods, including food, toys, books, electronics, art pieces, and even much more. However, it has gone even further and currently, it offers cloud infrastructure services (AWS), software, analytics services (Alexa), digital content and multimedia products.

Amazon began as an online bookstore and has grown to be a multi-billion corporation with 11 global marketplaces operating in North America, Europe, and Asia. It has a huge customer database from 180 countries.

How does it work?

Amazon is among the best online marketplaces for sellers worldwide. Third-party vendors add products, which are then included into site inventory. Once a consumer decides to make a purchase, a vendor is liable for filling the order.
