The Microlife Deluxe BP3GX1-5X  has a flexible nylon cuff that fits most arms (8.7 – 16.5 inches). Some users may find it difficult to wrap the cuff around their own arm and align the artery marker. Although it is not molded, the nylon is stiff. The numbers on the display are large and easy to read. First time set up is not difficult, although the incremental buttons for the time and date only advance in one direction. This monitor has averaging mode technology where 3 separate measurements can be automatically taken in succession after which the result is calculated and displayed as a single, average measurement. The device comes with a USB A to mini B cable and software. The software can also be downloaded from the company website. In order to download readings, you must first ensure that the correct date and time are set up on the monitor or the data will not transfer from the monitor to the software. The software allows the input of patient information and can formulate graphs and tables and shows averages. The software is not Mac compatible.|||
