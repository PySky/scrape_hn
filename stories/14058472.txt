What more fitting sentence for slander by social media then, than a series of daily apologies on Twitter?

This is the fate of fallen Spanish businessman Luis Pineda, who was yesterday found guilty of sending 57 libellous tweets by a Seville court.

The banker was ruled to have defamed the head of a consumer group, Rubén Sánchez, and will be carrying out his month-long punishment from prison.

The judge’s sentence is the latest in a three-year legal battle between Pineda and Facua, and is thought to be the first ruling of its kind.

There’s no escaping it, the line between our physical and digital lives has become increasingly blurred.

And, as we’ve seen with the rise of fake news, social media has the power to massively influence our judgement of truth.

Slander (of any kind) has to be taken seriously – and some major ‘influencers’ have more followers than traditional printed magazines.

A libellous newspaper gets thrown out after it’s read, but our digital imprints have far longer lifespans and can be difficult to ever completely ‘erase’.

In the Wild West of the internet, where social media goliaths make their own rules, poetic justice may not be enough.
