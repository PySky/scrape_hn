The distribution is fairly skewed with the average daily line for a stock being $480,381 but the median being $12,098. Here is a picture of the distribution on a log scale so you can see the tails more clearly:

You can see the top 10% of FTD lines are over $500k, 80% are over $1,000, and 50% are over $10k.

This is a continuing story that no-one has ever cared about. I continue to meander around the subject as I can't help but slow down and strain my neck as I pass the car crash that is NMS's Reg SHO and its Fails-To-Deliver (FTD).I've previously covered the topic in June 2016: " Billions of shares fail to settle - every month - you and I don't care ."I know you don't care. I can hardly blame you as the old back office and settlement details rarely excite. Us HFT types though, we get by only if we pay attention to the details. For my own curiosity I thought I'd check out what has been happening since mid 2016. After all, it is after 5PM on a Friday here in Australia - so, why not?Firstly, things don't quite seem so bad as the FTD share count dropped in 2016 to only a wee forty five billion shares - hardly noticeable:2017 seems to be heading in roughly the same direction as 2016. If you squint and hold your head on the correct angle, there may be a down trend emerging in the following monthly chart:Still, having around 4.5B shares per month failing to deliver for the last couple of months is not the happiest of circumstances. Let's dig into the 2017 Q1 data and pretend we care for a moment or two.So, the Q1 FTD share count is 11,694,519,023 fails. Who would miss such a small number of shares? To provide some perspective, IEX handled around 2B shares of lit volume in the same period, so it is more then five times IEX's lit volume. You'd think someone would care, but you'd be wrong.What's the dollar value? There are a couple of hundred thousand lines of stock and if we multiply quantity by price in the SEC's SHO files, we arrive at a grand total of:Which is slightly wrong. The figure is actually marginally higher. When we dig into the data we see around 5,000 of the more than 280,000 daily stock lines have no value and the SEC file simply reports a "." for the stock price for the symbol.Let's look at one such line:Here we see 2.2M shares of VPOR failed to deliver with a price of "." VPOR seems to have gone through a name change and has becomewith the same OTC stock code:The main feature of interest is that the share price was less than one cent and closed at $0.003. In the picture above, Feb 23 is the second spike in volume traded in that patch of heavier trading towards the end of the month. So, the FTD was worth around $6,858 but we record it as zero due to the file's pricing issue.Those 5000+ lines represent quite a few low priced shares. Of the 11.7B total FTD shares, 5.373B are low priced and generally OTC. 6.321B share have prices above 0.01 and are thus are properly registered in the SEC's files.That is, the $US 131.9B of FTD value represents 6.321B shares with an average price of $20.87.Let's look at the stats on those 6.321B shares in terms of daily value per stock of FTD:The biggest daily line was for 1.352B of SPY and here are the top fifty lines by value:It seems unusual to me that QQQ and SPY would be so prone to FTD. By any reasoning that is a lot of value in those stock lines that are failing proper settlement. However, the basic tenet of Reg SHO is that you and I don't care.|||
