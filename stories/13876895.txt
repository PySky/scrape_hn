Naive agile has no up-front work, but in practice we realize we have to do some. For ThoughtWorks, Inception is that "some". Since I joined ThoughtWorks in 2006, I realized all agile projects in the company started in a similar way. The project team would get together for a few weeks, going through many activities prior to starting the delivery work: this was the inception.

The ThoughtWorks inception was primarily developed by Luke Barrett around 2004. Jonathan Rasmusson (author of The Agile Samurai ) and Jeff Patton (author of User Story Mapping ) both worked at ThoughtWorks for a while, and they described and further developed inception techniques in their books, from which I learned a lot.

Our inceptions vary from project to project, but they usually generate alignment between the business and the technical people, and create an ordered list of user stories with estimates together with a release plan.

And I was very satisfied facilitating these agile inceptions this way until 2011, the year my son was born. The thing is, I was the inception facilitator, but the inception would take from two to four weeks. And I could not stay away from home for more than a week. I had to make the inceptions leaner, somehow make them fit in one week.

I was going on my first trip after my son was born. On a long flight from SÃ£o Paulo to San Francisco I read the Lean StartUp book from Eric Ries. From it I found the perfect excuse to reduce the inception length, and return home after one week.|||
