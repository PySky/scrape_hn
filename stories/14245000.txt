"Today it takes more than a simple legal advice to be compliant with the requirements of open source licenses. This guide is based on long-term experience and authors and represents a unique collection of practical information about how to solve the technical challenges compliance engineers are facing."

"Shane Coughlan and Armijn Hemel have created a wonderful resource for anyone working with open source software being shipped in a device. They describe in detail how to ensure compliance with the various software licenses and communities in which we all rely on."
