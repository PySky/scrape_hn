It is quite i mportant to note here that negative sign is

for representational p urpose and to indicate only the

particles in opposite compartment taken one in

Hence, we define an operator ‘ ʘ’ on system

: If we take two particles a and

a , as they are moving, their movements will

always be defined on G as a G

Now if we take three

particles a , a , a . As they are in motion, eith er we

focus on the movements on the lines of phase

sp ace shifts of a and a excluding a for

considerable point o f time. Or we co nsider other

two particles excluding one among thr ee particles

Existence of Identity: On the line, we can imagine

the existence of a particle a such that phase

space shifts of such a particle will not affect the

particles from one compartment to another

without affecting the ensemble provides us with

an insight on existence of inverse.
