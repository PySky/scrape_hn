#This was experimental branch of Caffe for OpenCL, we know recommend you use the now official OpenCL port of Caffe in BVLC GitHub Repo at https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/opencl

###OpenCL Caffe Experimental branch by AMD Reserach- No new development is happing on it.

This is an OpenCL implementation of Caffe, a mainstream DNN framework (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). It includes a largely complete Caffe feature set as of August 2015. The project is under active development to improve performance and add new features. Contributions from the community are welcome.

OpenCL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) is an open standard parallel programming language for heterogeneous platforms. OpenCL is supported by a variety of commercial chip manufacturers.

####Branches We have three branches in this repo.

-dev, the developer branch, we encourage people to contribute on this branch

-master, the original Caffe's master branch against which our code is synchronized.

-Performance improvement by batched implementation for conv layer based on clBLAS

-The user can choose the optimal batch number depending on H/W properties, image size and minibatch size

-Implemented in C++ and OpenCL, maintaining the same interfaces as the original Caffe

Note: More features are planned in the near future. Currently this implementation has been verified and tuned on AMD devices (CPUs/GPUs/APUs). Compatibility across different chip manufacturers will be considered for future addition.

We intend to keep updating the latest performance as we make optimizations. Fury results are preliminary and are actively being improved.

###Support needed As an open source project, we hope to maintain an open dynamics and sharing culture. We encourage the contribution and support from the community to improve it together.

###License The original Caffe is provided in the BSD 2-Clause license open source license. The OpenCL ports written by AMD is covered by AMD license. We encourage the contribution and support from external, your contribution will be covered either by BSD 2-Clause license or whichever your preferred license.

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors.
