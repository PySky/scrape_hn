 This is the command I use to fire up my development environment, when I switch customers, and when I make a system configuration change. It starts the 12 docker containers in an already running host.

 Just short of 2X.

 

 How about docker-compose up two environments simultaneously?

 MBP: Cannot do

 

 I can fire up two customer specific environments simultaneously in 30 seconds less than it takes to fire up one customer specific environment on my Macbook Pro! I think this result due to the extra cores in my Ryzen. The Macbook Pro has 4 cores, while the Ryzen has 8 cores. For this particular scenario I’m getting more than 2X performance, but it is not a direct comparison because the Macbook Pro cannot fit both environments in memory at the same time. This test highlights that the extra capacity provides a capability that was missing before (running two customer specific environments simultaneously).

 

 This command sets up an environment from scratch. It builds containers. It compiles ClojureScript, migrates database schemas, and does a docker up.

 756/548 == 1.38 with zoom sharing: 870/613 == 1.42

 

 Pretty handy, but not the the full 2X I was hoping for. Maybe `make up` is bottle-necking in other departments. I did a little digging and vagrant up takes about the same time on both systems, accounting for 30 seconds. So there is an example of something that was not improved at all. Perhaps I’m bottle-necking on network for some tasks?

 

 During these tests my Macbook Pro goes bonkers. Full fans, hot to touch. The Ryzen? Fans at the same low hum, CPU sitting cool at 40 celsius. But the most noticeable difference is that when I did subsequent runs I also did some multi-tasking. The Ryzen remains fully responsive and completely usable. You wouldn’t even know that it had anything else to do. The Macbook Pro has some serious lag going on.

 

 I had expectations that my PC would be more responsive. The Ryzen greatly exceeded those expectations. The whole experience of using my Ryzen PC is a big leap from using my Macbook Pro. On the Ryzen everything is noticeably snappier. Having the extra capacity available is great.

 

 I was hoping that ClojureScript compile times would be dramatically better with fast disk and more CPU. To my surprise it wasn’t as much as I anticipated. Perhaps the compiles are dominated by single thread CPU performance?

 To be able to tune and improve web pages, it helps to be able to profile them quickly. The Ryzen gets a 1.5X advantage. This page is a pretty standard public facing high traffic site. I wasn't expecting the extra compute power to have such a dramatic impact on normal browsing times. But so much of the web is JavaScript driven these days that it actually makes a big difference. So for profiling, bench-marking, and general web browsing there is a significant advantage here.

 

 I use VIM to edit files here and there because it opens instantly, and jump into Cursive for longer coding sessions. Ryzen: 0:9 0:9 0:9 with zoom sharing: 0:12 0:11

 For interactive web development I first need to fire up `lein figwheel`. Ryzen with zoom sharing: 0:12 0:11 0:11

 Less waiting, more coding.

 

 I took a 9GB file containing 300k events and used wc (word count) and ag (silver searcher, like grep):

 These results are all over the map. I don't understand why wc full is faster on the Macbook Pro. Or why grep is ridiculously faster on the Ryzen. Perhaps the implementations differ between OSX and Ubuntu?

 Using an IE9 Virtual Machine is very smooth on the Ryzen, it feels like a native browser. I can run the developer tools and profile the page comfortably. On the MBP, the virtual browser is painfully sluggish. I don’t see why the Ryzen does so much better here. Probably there is some VM specific factor at play.

 

 I installed Ubuntu. It was really easy to install. I made a bootable USB jump drive on my Macbook Pro, put it in the PC, bam, installed! Amazingly fast. Everything worked out of the box. No driver problems. Great!

 

 I like the Ubuntu interface. Window management is better than mac out of the box. Unity has hotkey and drag dock left right maximize and corners. Positioning windows is a breeze. PrintScreen takes a screenshot of the desktop, and Alt+PrintScreen captures the current application. It brings up a preview so you can edit/rename the image.

 

 The jarring difference from OSX is the slightly different use of common keyboard shortcuts. Copy + paste in the terminal require either shift+ins or ctrl+shift+c/v. I find this slows me down because I have to think about whether I’m in a terminal or not, and use different keys. Ctrl-a Ctrl-e don’t go to start of line or end of line in Ubuntu apps, so I am retraining myself to use the home/end key.

For programmers Linux is an upgrade over OSX or Windows. Why? Apt-get. Software dependency management with apt-get is fast, easy and works. Homebrew on OSX attempts to emulate apt-get, but is more wild west and falls short.



 Should you build a Ryzen based PC? Yes! Absolutely! There is a discontinuity in the CPU price to performance ratio introduced by the launch of this new CPU range. Programmers and enthusiasts stand to benefit with more raw power for their dollar. Building a PC is fun. It is just like Christmas with all sorts of interesting packages are arriving at your front door. I got a sense of accomplishment from putting my PC together. The final result looks and performs great. It did take a significant investment of time, effort, and attention to detail. As a computing enthusiast, that time was well spent.

 

 The Ryzen build specs on paper promised to be 2X better than my previous hardware. In most programming oriented tasks it delivered an improvement factor of around 1.5X. Responsiveness while multitasking was vastly improved. The cost of $1525 excluding peripherals was well below a premium off the shelf equivalent.

 

 Can Linux cut it? Yes! Ubuntu just keeps getting better. Linux on the desktop is really, really good these days.

 

 Is Intel doomed? Doubtful. On March 19 the Intel i7-6900K retails for over $1000; twice the price of the equivalent AMD Ryzen 1800X. It sure looks to me like AMD has jumped way ahead of Intel in CPUs for programmers. Such a direct comparison is for a small segment of the CPU market. There are other price points where Intel still beats AMD; ultra servers, low end servers, and laptops.

 

 Should you feel bad if you still prefer Mac? No! OSX software and Mac hardware are pretty great. It is impressive that a 4 year old laptop can still be in the same league as a modern desktop.

 

 Thank you for reading my blog, and have a great day!
