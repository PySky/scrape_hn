Résumé Exporter is a tool to export résumé data from different sources (LinkedIn, Xing, Stackoverflow) to json, xml, md, yaml, doc, pdf, html.

You can use it as a command-line tool, as a ruby library or online at programmercv.com.

Because you might need your résumé data in a different format, but don't want to retype everything. Also: If you export to a json file you can use that with the ProgammerCV Résumé Template for jekyll to host a html version of your résumé online.

Add it to your Gemfile:

Go to your public profile at https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings, or navigate to it via "Me" -> "View Profile" -> "Edit your public profile" Save the page as "Web Page, HTML only".

Go to your profile (sign in -> click on your name), and click on "Ansicht für Profilbesucher" Save the page as "Web Page, HTML only".

Go to your public profile (the old CV version, not the new developer story) e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/cv/wnm Save the page as "Web Page, HTML only".

Save your profile as html. Then use the command to extract data.

Example: extract resume data from .html file, and export as json:

That command will return a json formatted string, that looks like that

The default output format is a json string, based on the ProgrammerCV Résumé Schema
