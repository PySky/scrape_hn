Called SRT05e, the car will be the successor to the SRT01, from the same firm, which has been used since the Formula E race format was introduced – Spark having been selected in 2013 by the FIA.

“Spark engineers took advantage of 4 years of Formula E championship to increase the performance of this new car. Equipped with a futuristic design, the SRT05e is much more powerful,” said the firm.

Aside from different looks, the new car will have to travel twice as far as the original as the mid-race car-swap (to compensate for limited battery life) will be gone in season five.

The car will then remain largely the same through seasons 2019/20 (six) and 2020/21.

“The homologation of the power-trains that will be used from Season 5 is a very significant step because it means the cars will be able to run for twice as long while, at the very least, maintaining the same performance level,” said FIA president Jean Todt. “This highlights how motor sport can stimulate and accelerate development of new technologies, which can then be applied to road cars.”

The FIA has revealed nine ‘manufacturers’ for 2018/19 (the cars will all be Spark SRT05es, possibly with alternative motors).

“When we launched the series in 2012, we had forecast to secure at least three manufacturers by Season 5,” said Formula E founder and CEO Alejandro Agag. “This [nine teams] just goes to show the relevance of Formula E to the motor industry and as an attractive proposition to new audiences and commercial partners.”

Much of the original cars was made in the UK. So far is has been revealed that McLaren Applied Technologies will be supplying the standard battery to be used in season 5.|||

French firm Spark Racing Technology will once again be supplying all the racing cars for Formula E, when it enters season five next year. Called SRT05e, th
