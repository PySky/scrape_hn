A web browser extension that emulates Content Delivery Networks locally by intercepting requests, finding the required resource and injecting it into the environment. This all happens instantaneously, automatically, and no prior configuration is required. Feel free to use this testing utility to see if it's properly installed, enabled, and correctly configured.

Note: Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make Decentraleyes block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.

Now that there's a solid, Mozilla approved, foundation, it's time to move forward. Mobility, extensibility (through support for community-powered resource packages), and usability, will be the main points of attention during this phase.

Note: These long-term goals are subjective to change, and can be discussed. That is, as long as the suggestions do not conflict with the ultimate goal of realizing a free and open standard for exchanging web resource bundles.
