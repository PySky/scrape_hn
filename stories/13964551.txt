A new mixed logic/imperative programming language by Bob Kowalski and Fariba Sadri:

â€œLogic-based Production System" is a new computer language that combines the characteristics of an imperative programming language with those of a declarative database and knowledge representation language. It is the result of over a decade of research led by Bob Kowalski and Fariba Sadri at Imperial College London.

The kernel of LPS consists of a database, together with reactive rules of the form if antecedent then consequent. The database changes destructively in response to actions and external events, according to a domain-specific causal theory. Computation consists in making the reactive rules true, by performing actions to make the consequent true whenever the antecedent becomes true. In addition, LPS includes Prolog-like logic programs both to recognise when antecedents become true and to generate plans of actions that make consequents true.|||
