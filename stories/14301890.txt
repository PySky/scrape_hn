At Keen, we work hard to deliver amazing data experiences for our customers. To do that at scale, we’ve built automation to evaluate each of our accounts based on two key axes: Adoption and Relationship.

Adoption is all about product usage. What parts of our API is the customer using? Is usage trending up or down? Who’s logging in and how frequently?

Relationship measurements are all about the humans. Is our relationship multithreaded, meaning are we in contact both with frontline users of Keen as well as those with budget and authority? Has a key champion left the company recently? Is Keen strategic to this customer’s business, or yet another tool?

Plotted on a 2-by-2, we arrive at a framework for understanding our customers at scale, and building playbooks to respond accordingly.

Once we understand how our customers fit into these quadrants, we can begin working with them on their path to success. But with thousands of customers, how can we possibly manage a such a seemingly high-touch process?

To understand our customers at a high level, we built a data tool called Valerian, which we use to track manual metrics around relationship and automated metrics related to adoption.

Not only are we able to track trends over time and compare the relative health of all accounts, we’re able to drill into a granular view of how the customer engages with our product. This information is useful for virtually all teams at Keen.|||
