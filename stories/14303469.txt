Tiny library(1.3Kb) to manage your application state. It supports interceptors(modifiers) to handle and modify data on the fly.

Check out the folder for usages, but this is the common usage.

; store ({ loading }); unsubscribe . (( ) { . ( , state); (); }); ( , ) { ( ) . ( { { newState, . () } }); }; Update the store, with a call to a api . ({ loading }, initialDataModifier);

And that's about it!|||
