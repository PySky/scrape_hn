The drone industry is growing at a rapid pace, the aerospace research company Teal Group estimated that sales of military and civilian drones will total over $89 billion in the next 10 years. The possible fields of application for UAVs are unlimited in both military and civil industries.

The rapid diffusion of drones raises many concerns related to their security and the threat they could represent to the privacy.

We have discussed several times about the possibility to hack these complex systems and related consequences.

At the Virus Bulletin 2015 conference, the security researcher Oleg Petrovsky of HP Security Research detailed methods that can be used to hack the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Oleg Petrovsky demonstrated how to hack a drone by targeting its flight controller, the expert has analyzed the controllers for various multi-rotor drones and discovered various of weaknesses that could be exploited in cyber attacks.

Despite there are numerous models of drones available on the market, they usually are composed of the same basic components, including motors, batteries, sensors, a GPS unit, a gyroscope, a remote control radio receiver, electronic speed controllers (ESC), and the flight controller.

Petrovsky focused its research on attacks targeting the flight controller, which are systems composed of several sensors and a processing unit.

The majority of drones uses the same flight controllers such as the ArduPilotMega (APM) and Pixhawk from 3D Robotics, MultiWii, OpenPilot, and DJI Naza.

A potential attacker can focus its efforts in hacking these controllers in order to target a wide range of models.

Petrovsky utilized for its test an ArduPilotMega (APM) flight controller on a drone built by himself and a Mission Planner, which is a ground station application.|||
