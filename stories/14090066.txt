The world needs more women-led companies.

One way we will get there faster is by building a community where successful women can share stories and advice for those who are in earlier stages of building a company.

Y Combinator’s 4th Female Founders Conference is a free-to-attend, half-day event in San Francisco that features founders and CEOs who will provide practical advice and best practices on starting a startup.

If you’re thinking about starting a company or are in the early stages of building one, we would love to meet you. You’ll join 800+ founders from all over and the investors who fund them.

Speakers include YC alumnae and guests who will talk about how they got started, what went wrong, what surprised them, and what happened as their companies grew.

We’re also hosting Open Office Hours with Female Founders the day after the conference (June 30). Sign up for Female Founders Office Hours with YC, YC alumni, and investors here.|||
