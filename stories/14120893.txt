Microsoft’s marketing department often names its products in names that don’t reveal anything about their “real” version numbers. Recently it’s mainly years, like “Visual Studio 2015” but it could be numbers which don’t correspond to the products’ internal version numbers.

As a developer, you often really want to know what the internal version of a product is. For instance, you want to understand whether a version is a minor release to an internally identical core or a new major release.

This information, apparently, is scattered around the Internet, mostly in separate sources of data and not as one comprehensive source. This is not always the case, but it is most of the time.

I’ve compiled several unified lists of several of Microsoft’s lines of products that are relevant for developers – the most prominent ones: Windows, Visual Studio, .NET, SQL Server.

If you find any mistake or have an update, I strongly encourage you to update me and I’ll update this list so it will be relevant for the long-term of course, and not serve as a one-time-but-irrelevant-as-time-goes blog post.

Very dynamic, and now contains multiple modules such as .NET Core, .NET Native, .NET Framework, .NET Compiler Platform and more.

The latest release .NET Framework version (basically before the above partitioning introduced in what’s still called vNext) is Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7. It is preinstalled on Windows 10 Creators Update. It is currently not available for installation on earlier versions of the Windows operating system.

At this stage, I prefer to link to this quite comprehensive and Wikipedia-maintained up-to-date list of .NET versions.|||
