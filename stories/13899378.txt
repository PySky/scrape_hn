On behalf of the community, I am pleased to announce Spring Vault 1.0 RC1.

The artifacts are available in the Milestone repo.

Here’s a short-list of the most important features shipping with the release:

Without the community, we couldn’t be the successful project we are today. I’d like to thank everyone that created issues & provided feedback.

If you have feedback on this release, I encourage you to reach out via StackOverflow, GitHub Issues, or via the comments section. You can also ping me @mp911 or the @SpringCloud team on Twitter.

The upcoming Spring Cloud Vault Config 1.0 RC release will depend on Spring Vault RC1 and will be shipped as part of the upcoming Spring Cloud Dalston RC1 release train. Expect a GA release soon.
