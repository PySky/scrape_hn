How far can you make a tower lean? Bricks optional. Lower-mass cuboids should work just as well.

Try to keep the comments spoiler free! But I do not mind calculations for how far a specific number of bricks will reach.



If you have in-depth working-out (or a video of you building a tower) which would would like to share: email it over. matt@standupmaths.com



I will do a follow-on video eventually.



Support me on Patreon and help me make follow-on videos quicker.
