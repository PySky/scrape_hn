Last year, my colleague Cherian Abraham and I partnered with Ben Bajarin and Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies to explore how consumers were using the Amazon Echo, an innovative product featuring Alexa, Amazon’s first-generation voice assistant. Given the extremely positive reception the Echo was receiving at the time, we wanted to learn what resonated with consumers as they interacted with their Echo (2016 Experian results can be found here). At the same time, we wanted to see how that compared to behavior with existing digital assistants in the market.

Today, we are excited to announce that Experian and Creative Strategies have teamed up for the second year focusing on the consumer adoption of new products in the space including Apple’s AirPods and Google Home in addition to the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot.  We also explored consumer interest in financial services products offered through voice interfaces. Ben, from Creative Strategies, wrote about our Experian Voice survey highlighting the breakout customer satisfaction success for Apple AirPods today.

In the coming weeks, Cherian and I will be sharing more of our insights from the rich data in our survey.  Additionally, we will be presenting on the topic at the upcoming Experian Vision Conference on May 10th.  Topics that we will cover include:
