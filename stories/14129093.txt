Maze is a Life-like cellular automaton in which cells survive from one generation to the next if they have at least 1 and at most 5 neighbours. Cells are born if they have exactly 3 neighbours. This resembles Conway's Game of Life in some ways, but it is rather more difficult for cells to die off, and random starting patterns tend to evolve into complex growing maze-like structures with well-defined walls outlining corridors.

The maze rule is explosive, which means that most randomly-generated starting patterns will explode in all directions. Nonetheless, there are many still lifes and oscillators under this rule. It has no known spaceships.[1]

Below are all still lifes with nine or fewer cells in the maze rule.[2] It is worth noting that, because the only difference between this rule and the standard Conway rule is that cells have more ways of staying alive, every pattern that is a still life in standard Life is also a still life in the maze rule. Similarly, every still life in the maze rule will also be a still life in the Life without death rule.

Other notable still lifes include the infinitely-extensible diagonal line. Also, any diamond in which every other cell is alive (i.e. any barge that is extended in either length and/or width) is a still life.

The smallest period 2 oscillator is an on-off that has several different possible stators, some of which are shown below.

One wickstretcher that commonly appears from random starting configurations is shown below. Its period is 12 and it travels at speed c/3. It can be stabilized on the left edge in many different ways.

The most well-known related rule is known as mazectric, which has rulestring 1234/3. That is, it is the same as the maze rule except that cells don't survive if they have 5 neighbours. This results in maze patterns that tend to have longer and straighter corridors.|||
