We connect refugee students with programming education in order to lift them out of dire economic/political circumstances and allow them to express themselves on the modern canvas: technology. Students who learn to program become better architects of their future and can express themselves creatively with coding projects. They relish the challenge to become creators of technology and be active participants instead of passive consumers. In addition, the computational thinking skills that underlie coding will allow them to continuously adapt to our increasingly data-filled world. Just like a second language, programming concepts are best learned young. In addition to equipping our students with the necessary tools to innovate, we also train them vocationally to obtain high-paying software engineering and design jobs at startups across the world.
