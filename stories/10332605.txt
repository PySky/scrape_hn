At WWDC 2015, Adobe director of engineering David McGavran demonstrated After Effects and Illustrator on Mac integrated with Metal , Apple's new high-performance graphical acceleration API on OS X El Capitan. At the end of the demo, he said that Adobe is committed to bringing Metal to multiple Creative Cloud apps on Mac.Adobe has since changed its tune about its commitment to Metal on Mac, however, as Adobe product manager Todd Kopriva this week said in the Adobe Communities that the company has not made a commitment to Metal or any other GPU acceleration technology at this time.Kopriva admitted that Adobe "sent a confusing message" about its commitment to Metal.Adobe's demo included Illustrator's rending engine built on Metal, which allowed for continuous zoom, while After Effects had up to an 8x performance improvement in rendering and reduced CPU usage with Metal. Metal is available for both iOS and OS X developers, with documentation, sample code and video tutorials available on Apple's website.Adobe provided the following statement to MacRumors:(Thanks, Chris!)|||
