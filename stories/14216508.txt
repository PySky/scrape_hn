It makes sense to start with SXSW. South-by-Southwest gets its own section as one of the biggest events in Austin (and the world), since 1987. Nearly a two-week marathon of technology, music, and film, bringing together an incredible mix of people and experiences.

“The South by Southwest® (SXSW®) Conference & Festivals celebrate the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries. Fostering creative and professional growth alike, SXSW® is the premier destination for discovery.”

Outlets and channels to keep a pulse on Austin news, both those related to marketing and potential marketing opportunities.

Associations and groups centered on marketing or where you may find marketers or marketing content.

Who and where are people discussing marketing on social media.

What conferences are nearby that marketers may be interested in traveling to from Austin. Some in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, etc… Coming soon. Send me any you know of!

The goal of this project is to map out the Austin marketing landscape and be an ever-evolving curated stack.
