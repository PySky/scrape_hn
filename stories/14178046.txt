We billed FunctionConf as mainland Europe's first conference on serverless architectures and platforms with 20+ practical talks and workshops by leading industry experts, for devops, developers and cloud strategists. We had an excellent venue in Amsterdam's Pakhuis de Zwijger.

Up until the end of April, though, ticket sales were too low to reasonably expect we could gather a large enough audience in time. We were set to ask all speakers, partners and sponsors for a promotional push, but we had insufficient reason to expect that even their considerable reach might push attendance to the point where the event is viable.

The worst we could think of was to have everyone's involvement and public support increased, only to still sell too few tickets and then having to discontinue, after all. Deciding to postpone the event in such a situation would be even worse than doing so now.

Since May 1, we've contacted all speakers and sponsors, all suppliers, our venue, and everyone who was kind enough to buy a ticket. We've refunded 100% of all purchased tickets and we've refunded 100% of all sponsor contributions.|||
