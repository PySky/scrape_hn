This is ‘the’ moment in time for mobile app developers, thanks to the increased adaptability of mobile phones and the subsequent increase in the demand for mobile application development. Today, there are about 4 Billion mobile phone users in the world, who have downloaded 179.62 Billion apps as of 2015. So literally, billions of apps are in operation today and are making our lives easier. However, as this ecosystem of mobile apps grows, so are the expectations of users.

And it’s not the responsibility of solely an app development. Entrepreneurs who outsource mobile application development or hire app developers should be equally aware of these hurdles, and think of ways to derive possible solutions.
