The 19th century brought us boundaries, the 20th century we built walls, the next we will bridge nations by creating communities based on shared principles of economic resiliency, energy independence and a trust based social contract.



Otra Nation is a regenerative territory open to citizens of both Mexico and the United States that is co-maintained by both governments. Physical land and the initial investment will be provided by both countries and the infrastructure and services will be built with a workforce of 50% Mexico and 50% American. Otra Nation will be the worlds’ first continental bi-national socio-ecotone.



Since the end of WWII the planet has seen a ten-fold increase in physical borders. These visual scars are deeper still when nations share a rich and vibrant history together. Mexico and the United States have always prospered when they see each others strengths by working together. We propose a trans-national ’New Deal’ to build an innovative shared co-nation based on local economic empowerment, energy independence and revolutionary infrastructure and transit. 



Let's build a future with next century technology... at the cost of the last.
