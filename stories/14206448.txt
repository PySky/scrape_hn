If you’re planning on sending high volumes, we happily offer volume discounts. Talk to Sales to find out more.

For the last year Notify has been in Developer Preview, the first stage of product development at Twilio. We invited some of the most innovative companies with a fitting use-case to try the product and give us feedback. Based on what we heard, we added new channels like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), made it easier to segment and notify the right users, and simplified debugging your application. With all these improvements and much more to come, we’re excited to open the beta program to all developers and help build better notification experiences for users everywhere.

We can’t wait to see what you build with multi-channel notifications!|||
