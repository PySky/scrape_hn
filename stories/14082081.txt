Those people call themselves "Libertarians", but that term is propaganda for their peculiar views. It embodies a claim that respecting "human rights" includes letting businesses trample their workers, their customers, the environment, and the public; that it requires leaving poor people on their own if they can't afford food, water, or medical care.

The state's mission includes enabling everyone to have a decent life, which includes both social programs and respect for human rights.

As for those who define human rights to include laissez faire for businesses and reducing taxes for the rich, I won't endorse that position by calling them "Libertarians". I call them "Antisocialists".|||
