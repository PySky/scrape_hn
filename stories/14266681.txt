After any outage or severe incident at Hootsuite, we take a closer look at the event to uncover valuable lessons and data. We do this by working backwards, asking “Why?” to find the most likely root causes for the problem. Then we put in place incremental improvements to bulletproof ourselves against a reoccurrence.

Before I explain our mindset, practice, and step-by-steps, let me tell you a story.

On April 6th, 2017, my spidey-sense started to tingle, my hands began to sweat, and I had that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach: all the physical and emotional signs of having done something wrong.

Turns out, I brought down part of our site for 39 minutes. More specifically, our users were unable to post to LinkedIn or to add new LinkedIn accounts. I had inadvertently deleted the Hootsuite app from the LinkedIn Developer Portal because I thought I was deleting my developer access to the app. Fortunately, for our customers, this happened in the evening around 6:30PM PDT when our site is not under heavy load.

What happened next says everything about our culture.

The next day, a member of our Ops team facilitated a blameless post mortem called a “5 Whys” that focused on the timeline, data about the event, what went wrong, and how we can fix our system so the same issue doesn’t happen again.

Note, the words fix our system, not how we can fix me. Like most humans, I’m well intentioned but fallible. Many of us could have made that error. In fact, having personal social network accounts able to administer the one key connection to our social networks has been a time-bomb waiting to happen. This event is a catalyst for long-overdue change.

“Human error is a symptom—never the cause—of trouble deeper within the system” – Dave Zwieback in an article on First Round Review.

So, the question is how can we bulletproof our system so the next person doesn’t have the same inadvertent nightmare? A more humorous way of saying this is from Dan Milstein, in How to Run a 5Why’s (with Humans not Robots): “Let’s plan for a future where we are all as stupid as we are today” 🙂 Focusing on the system instead of the person is a way to remove the stigma of speaking up when we feel guilt for an accident. This key because accidents contain valuable information and should be “seen as a source of data, not something embarrassing to shy away from” via John Allspaw.

Next, we post a summary of our 5 Whys, on our internal tool called Morgue (also from Etsy) and take actions to abate the probability or a repeat event.

The following list is from invaluable thinkers who influenced our mindset, practices, tools

Something happens… an outage or incident Read the articles above. If you read just one, read this one. Set a time for a post-mortem. The sooner the better. Grab a whiteboard. A note about where to hold it. A whiteboard is in public place, not in a meeting room. We also leave the details up until the next 5 Whys. This is a visible reminder of openness and it invites participation from passers-by who provide input based on their past experiences. Invite the people or persons who… (taken from Bethany Macri‘s talk on post-mortems): Conduct a 5 Why’s (blameless post-mortem). Focus on the system not the person. Like Dan Milstein says, start with humour to get participants to open up. Relative to other disasters… How bad is this? Did the site go down? Accidentally post from our main twitter handle? Lose customer data? Send an email to all our users with the greeting “Hello FName!” Drill down Ask “Why?” at least five times. Each statement should be both verifiable (how do you know?) and not compound (single cause). An example from Five Whys – How To Do It Better: Why? Change of position of bracket results in vibration <– COMPOUND You must be able to work up the chain (last ‘why’ to the first ‘why’) to verify the causation. List the improvements you can make to bulletproof the system Ask people to commit to completing an improvement. How do we arrive at action items and commitments? Organically. As a heuristic, point to each “why”, and to each step in the timeline, then ask how we can improve the process, technology, and training for each item; and who will take it on. Publish it in Morgue or in the most visible communication channel. Follow-up on that channel as you make the fixes and share your learnings. To everyone who helped with this outage. To Jonas, Beier, Geordie, Tyler, James, and Trenton for their contributions to this process and their help putting this article together. Noel focuses on culture, employee engagement, technical community involvement, and training for Hootsuite’s technical groups. He loves to exchange ideas and would like to hear how you do these things at your organization. Get in touch via LinkedIn.|||
