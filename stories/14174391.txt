Code review is the process of reviewing code written by someone else in order to increase it’s quality.

Code review is good, and you can learn a lot from it. But can be very harmful for you if you don’t really understand the why behind it.

If someone is reviewing your code, it doesn’t mean he’s more intelligent than you. It means: he has a fresh eye for the problem you are trying to solve. That’s all!

This means a Junior can review a Senior’s code, and vice versa. Because when you think about a problem, you’ll go deeper to the point where you’ll miss other simple solutions. And anyone can be trapped, regardless of his intelligence or seniority.

Be open and accept other’s point of view! Discuss and share knowledge.

Don’t develop feelings for your code! It feels so weird to write this, but I’ll repeat it: DON’T DEVELOP FEELINGS FOR YOUR CODE!

It’s a code and can change overtime, by you or by someone else. Don’t resist it, it’s not your baby! And you are not supposed to develop feelings for it!

If the response to the first point is be open and accept reviews. This one is a little bit tricky! You don’t know when you start developing feelings for someone from day one, you actually know after a while (usually, when it’s too late and you can’t go back).

But there are some signs. If you feel you are saying NO or blocking a reviewer’s point of view “just because” or without a valid argument. Congratulations, you are in love with your own code! Now move your ass and think about it!|||
