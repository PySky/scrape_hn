Build your first Ember application with our 5 minute tutorial.

Ember.js is built for productivity. Designed with developer ergonomics in mind, its friendly APIs help you get your job doneâ€”fast.

Don't waste time making trivial choices. Ember.js incorporates common idioms so you can focus on what makes your app special, not reinventing the wheel.

Write dramatically less code with Ember's Handlebars integrated templates that update automatically when the underlying data changes.

Ember makes Handlebars templates even better, by ensuring your HTML stays up-to-date when the underlying model changes. To get started, you don't even need to write any JavaScript.

Experience the future of the web platform today with Ember's components. Components allow you to create your own application-specific HTML tags, using Handlebars to describe their markup and JavaScript to implement custom behavior.

Ember.js eliminates the boilerplate of displaying JSON retrieved from your server. If you know how to use jQuery, you know how to fetch models in Ember.

Build JavaScript apps that don't break the web! Ember.js makes it downright simple to create sophisticated, multi-page JavaScript applications with great URL support, in a fraction of the code you'd write in other frameworks.|||
