Welcome to the Garden Bubble Cam 

 Mire este sitio en español. You can watch live streaming video of the back patio of our south Florida home.  If nothing is going on, you can turn on a 30 second blast of bubbles from our bubble machine.  The camera is only active during daylight hours so if you see a black image, please return during daylight hours (Eastern Time U.S) 



 



 Press the "Bubbles" button to turn on a 30 second blast of bubbles.

It may take a few seconds  but you should see bubbles soon.|||

This is the personal web site of Andie and Mike.  It has become a popular web destination for visitors of our interactive Bubblecam.
