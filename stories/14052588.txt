Hanami is a full-stack, lightweight, yet powerful web framework for Ruby.

Back in the summer of 2012, as a frustrated web developer, I started an experiment to rethink Ruby on Rails and to build a modern web framework for Ruby. The goal was to keep all what I consider the good parts of Rails and to add extra components to ease long term maintenance and testability.

The experiment was promising, and I eventually started to open source Hanami at the beginning of 2014.

Since then, it's been amazing journey. I have learned a lot about Ruby, Open Source, and people. The community aspect of this experience is key to me. Software is made by people for people. It's political. Hanami is a consequence of my vision: I, we, want to include people, keep them motivated to work on Open Source, and have fun together.

This goes beyond Hanami. Alongside with other projects like ROM, dry-rb, and Trailblazer we're influencing how modern web applications are written with Ruby.

After 1392 days, 6205 commits, made by 295 people, we're proud to announce Hanami 1.0.0! 🌸

A huge thank you goes to all of the people who contributed in all these years. 💚💙💛❤️

Open Source doesn't mean just "open code". Above all, it means an open decision process. Today marks a change in the governance of Hanami: we'll now have a diverse team to make decisions about the future of the project, together.

I'm excited to announce an expansion of the core team, by adding marvellous new people I've met during these years:



 Along with Alfonso Uceda (already a member), we'll work on the future of Hanami.
