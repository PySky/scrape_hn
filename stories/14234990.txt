Geate News in NLE. Sony Vegas Pro is entering into a brand new era! The latest Sony Vegas Pro 14 is taken into the next level with some highlights and new features. The native ProRes support would be added into Sony Vegas Pro 14. If you have ever worked with ProRes in Sony Vegas Pro, you would know the pain.

The first issue is that the luminance range is spread after the import in Vegas. Means that if you shoot with a GH4 and a Shogun to 16..255 what you can adjust in the camera, then you will end up with clipping of the highlights. Even 16..235 will be shown in the wrong luminance range. Second, ProRes is not decoded as 10bit in Vegas Pro 13, what makes the whole processing of ProRes senseless (since if somebody uses ProRes then he is not going for a typical consumer workflow). Third, Vegas crashes when you import a certain number of Shoghun or Q7+ ProRes files. On an old system the limit was about 20-25 files.

 

 All together Vegas is not useful for a ProRes workflow up to now. But with the Sony Vegas Pro, you can expect to eliminate the pain. You never need to worry that the broadcasters that you deal with would like for you to deliver in a native ProRes format. You are also free to downloaded a bunch of Apple ProRes Quicktime 4K clips and get them to load and work in Vegas Pro. However, if you are using Vegas Pro 13 and lower versions Sony Vegas Pro, HD/4K ProRes is still the headache. The only way to edit HD/4K ProRes in Sony Vegas Pro 13 and lower version is still to transcode HD/4K ProRes to MOV or MP4 and other Vegas Pro supported video. In addition, if your computer is low-end one, you'd better convert HD/4K ProRes to MP4, too, even you are running the latest Sony Vegas PRO 14.

You can use Pavtube Video Converter to help you convert vairous ProRes including Apple ProRes 4444 XQ, Apple ProRes 4444, Apple ProRes 422 HQ, Apple ProRes 422, Apple ProRes 422 LT and Apple ProRes 422 Proxy to Sony Vegas Pro Supported MP4, MOV, WMV, etc with no quality loss.
