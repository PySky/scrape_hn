Amazon's recently released its new Echo Look device, which is a modified Amazon Echo device with a camera added. One of the new features is a 'style check'. From TechCrunch:

The device also works with the companyâ€™s Style Check, a feature of the Echo Look app, which uses machine learning to compare different outfit choices, awarding them an overall style rating. The app uses a combination of machine learning and advice from experts in the style space. Letting AI pick out your clothing in the morning should be a pretty interesting experiment.

I'm interested in how, exactly, the 'machine learning' determines which clothes are more or less stylish. I would imagine that style is a very subjective measure which is difficult to capture with a computer, but I'm not particularly familiar with developments with regards to using computer vision for fashion.

I'm not holding my hopes too high that Amazon would disclose how their algorithms work, but are there any similar approaches with regard to computer vision and style? Is there any information about how Amazon might have implemented this, or already-known methods?|||
