Ever wondered if there is place for software developers in the Star Wars Universe? TemplateMonster’s team loves Star Wars and, as you could expect, we also love programming. That’s why I thought it might be fun to compare George Lucas’ (and J.J. Abrams’) characters to some of the most popular programming languages of 2015.

I used the RedMonk Programming Language Ranking for this one. Hope you’ll find this entertaining, and may the Force be with you!

P.S. What other languages would you include into this list and what Star Wars characters would be using them?|||

See TemplateMonster's infographics explaining what language the legendary Star Wars characters would use if they knew how to code.
