Opens the door to access leading CUDA libraries for numerical computing: cuBLAS, cuFFT, cuDNN...

CUDA gives you access to many hardware optimizations on Nvidia hardware.

Built with Clojure in mind. Sane interface and functions that fit into functional style while still respecting the reality of number crunching with CUDA .

You can easily translate examples from best books about CUDA.

Check out the Neanderthal native matrix library. You can use its source code as a real-world example of how to harness GPU power from Clojure.|||
