One of the biggest reasons I've seen people fail when it comes to running a business and including online resources is that they don't keep at it. Continue moving along with your plan you've made and adjust as needed. Don't expect to see results over night. Don't expect to see amazing results even within the first week or even the first month. Success takes time. Stay consistent and focused as you grow your business and you'll begin to see the fruits of your labor before you can imagine.|||
