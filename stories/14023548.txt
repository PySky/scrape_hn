All the ways I’ve earned a [good] living from marketing

Sometimes I research keywords when I face analysis paralysis around which content idea I should pursue next. Last night was one of those nights.

During my research, I noticed a lot of people are searching for things like, “what can I do with a marketing degree” and “marketing degree jobs.” I’m taking a stab at user intent here, but I think what people are looking for are ways to earn a living from marketing.

To be upfront, I don’t have a marketing degree. I’m a journalism dropout, who learned everything I know from people smarter than me, by reading A LOT and by *doing* a lot. I didn’t go to some fancy, schmancy bootcamp, and I’m not “certified” — whatever the hell that means.
