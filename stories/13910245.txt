There are approximately 3 billion people in the global workforce. LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every one of them. The development of the world's first Economic Graph will lead to making that vision a reality. This, of course, is no easy task. Our vision is grand, but it is not unattainable.

So, here's the challenge: Given the wealth of data that exists within LinkedIn, what research would you propose that has the potential to create greater economic opportunity?

We are launching the LinkedIn Economic Graph Research program to encourage researchers, academics and data-driven thinkers to solve some of the most challenging economic problems of our times.

Together, we believe we can effectively remove barriers to economic growth and create opportunity for every member of the global workforce.|||
