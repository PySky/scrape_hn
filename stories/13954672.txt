The World Economic Forum (WEF) has announced that their second annual search for Afrika's top female technology innovators and entrepreneurs is now open. Applications are said to be open to any female entrepreneur whose business is less than three years old, uses innovative technology or business models, and has at least one year of revenue generation. Added to that, the business must also be able to demonstrate social and economic potential.

Applications for the 2017 search for Africa’s top female innovators can submitted on the WEF website.

“We want Africa’s top female tech entrepreneurs to join us so we can celebrate them as role models and so they can help governments and policymakers create conditions for others to flourish.” said Elsie Kanza, Head of Africa at the World Economic Forum.

The 2017 World Economic Forum on Africa will take place on 3-5 May 2017 in Durban, South Africa, under the theme "Achieving Inclusive Growth". The meeting will convene regional and global leaders from business, government and civil society to explore solutions to create economic opportunities for all. It will provide insight from leading experts on how Africa will be affected by the onset of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, particularly in terms of safeguarding the region’s economies from negative disruption and exploiting opportunities for further growth and development.

The closing date for application submissions is 17 April 2017.|||
