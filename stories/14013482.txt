Okay, this is a big project, but we can do it! I've reduced the Mona Lisa to 100 x 150 pixels using the /r/place color palate. Right now the canvas is full of Dickbutts, Peniszards, and some pretty neat 8-bit Links. Let's do something cultured, and what's a more clich√© cultured icon than the Mona Lisa? That'll show those mods.. right?

I tried to pick a relatively empty starting point so we're not messing up anyone else's stuff. 325 x 375 is the top leftmost pixel, and we go from there. We need a total of 15,000 pixels to finish this, but hey if Blue can fill an entire corner then we can probably pull this off.

This is the guide, broken down into 10 x 10 squares. Let's coordinate in the comment section and wrangle this renaissance gal into the year 2017!

Edit: We had to move the starting point so we don't risk collision with Rainbow Road and the White Hole. Only 50 pixels to the left, and at this point we're mostly focused on the top border so this shouldn't hurt too much.

Edit: I just want to say this is coming along beautifully and I'm proud of all of you. Sorry to the club penguin folks, didn't mean to overlap! Also, there seems to be another (far inferior) Mona Lisa in the top right, this is not us.

Edit: /u/eipifi made a fantastic guide with coordinates added to the axis. https://imgur.com/a/qy7Pl

Edit: And another helpful guide by /u/beelzebobcat that breaks it down into smaller chunks. Thank you! http://imgur.com/a/n8i7Y

Edit: Collaboration ongoing at the Protect The Art discord group: https://discord.gg/eGyj52m Also the /r/MonaLisaClan/ subreddit has been created! (Thank you /u/djdogjuam2 and /u/blue-no-yellow)

I pulled the color palate and broke it down into web colors, rgb, and cmyk. If you have your own artwork you want to bring to life in /r/place, this should help.|||
