Introduce N2O Protocols for commercial use on top of the MQTT protocol. Minimize and remove all features, duplicated by the MQTT pub-sub broker. Provide an EMQ extension that immediately activates the N2O protocol and its applications for all connected MQTT devices. Create a single Erlang eco-system for Enterprise Protocol Federation and establish a solid CORBA/WS-SOAP/XMPP-replacement, ready for high-speed, low-latency IoT applications.|||
