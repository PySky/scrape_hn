Android Studio, the software platform provided to developers to create Android Apps, looks like it might be on its way to Chrome OS. While the majority of us are not software developers, this possibility brings with it some serious promise.

As you can see in this commit, Android Studio on Chrome OS could be on its way. This hasn’t been fully realized or confirmed, but the implications are very intruiging.

On first glance I, like many of you, simply thought “Yeah, so what?”

I’m not an app developer, so I didn’t inherently grasp the importance of this setup right away. And if you don’t, that’s OK. Let’s look at it.

In general, when developing app, developers have to use Android Studio on Windows, Mac or Linux.

They install the studio, build and develop apps, and then test them in an emulated environment.

While this environment is great, it still isn’t testing on fully functioning Android.

With Android Studio running on a Chromebook, developers would be given an all-in-one environment to not only build, but also test and run their creations in a fully-functioning Android Framework.

Where I always thought it would be cool for Chromebooks to run Android Studio and be used for app development, this new use case is even more intriguing.

Though we aren’t for sure this will happen, it is just another possible niche for Chromebooks to fill down the road as our favorite OS continues to grown and develop.

Thanks to +Yanny Mishchuck for the heads up!|||
