The market has spoken. Its verdict: Pure Storage isn’t worth quite the $3.1 billion it believed itself to be, at least out of the gate.

That doesn’t mean the stock is suddenly cheap, even after slipping as much as 6% from its $17 listing price on its first day of trading Wednesday. Nor does it necessarily reflect a distaste for rapidly growing, money-losing tech startups that may need to tap the markets in the near future.

The latter point will be heavily debated in days to come given the recent dearth of tech IPOs and the growing herd of richly valued unicorns that—at some point—need to provide an exit to their investors.

If Pure Storage is any indication, investors are still willing to pay a premium for exposure to high growth. In two years, Pure took its annual revenue from $6.1 million to $174.5 million. So even trading down from its IPO price, Pure Storage is still fetching nearly 11 times trailing revenue: far and away the largest multiple among its peers.

That means the company still has a lot of work ahead to justify its valuation. Investors will expect it to maintain a pace of hypergrowth, along with showing improved cost leverage and a path to eventual profitability.

More than half of the company’s current workforce comes from established rivals EMC , NetApp and Hewlett-Packard , according to LinkedIn. Experience like that doesn’t come cheap; Pure Storage recorded nearly $112 million in operating losses for the six-month period ended July 31.

So while a lackluster IPO may have damped expectations, Pure Storage still has high hopes to live up to.|||

Even after its disappointing debut, Pure Storage carries a rich valuation that it will have to live up to.
