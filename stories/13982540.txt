Please note: as this is a free application, I have not paid for the $150 Apple Developer Program to sign it. This means you will get an “Unidentified Developer” warning from macOS’s Gatekeeper. Go here to open the app regardless

This app is in no way endorsed by Trello, I am simply a big Trello user and like to have it in my macOS Dock.|||
