webVR Markup applies the HTML/CSS way of positioning and styling to a 3D object.

Most of the 3D markup language is svg, it declares cube, geometries, vertices and material. I want a real HTML/CSS VR markup language that declares table, room, picture, grass planes, plants, human and stairs.

then include MetaRoomMarkup and webcomponentsjs in your html

Meta style will be like style sheet.
