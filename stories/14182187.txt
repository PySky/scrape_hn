The Proposal



I am no Shakespeare,

but even he was once an aspirer...

please forgive me in advance, I beg,

If you see mistakes, you are the teacher I'm afraid...



Though not the only, I'll always be your biggest admirer,

don't remind me, if you don't want to see me a murderer...

From day one, you are the only one I see,

for I have a horse's vision, here's the doctor's prescription, you see.. 



In the world of romance, I am no abecedarian,you know,

but if you share you stories, I'll just cover my ears and go...

but I'll come back, as I always do..

because there is no home, without you...



Although I am Acrophobic, I'll make do,

and if you want, I'll climb your three storied balcony too..

and although I can't swim, I'll acquire a boat,

and if you want,however filthy, I'll conquer every moat..



I am no knight in shining armor, those are out of sale..

but I'll wear even the garbage bag, which you ordered through mail..

Although I have it's vision, I can't ride a horse,

But when I fall down the stairs, you can laugh in remorse...





I am not Romeo and you are not Juliet, to be clear,

My love won't take dive like the sensex, though may fluctuate here & there..

Also,I am allergic to poison my dear,

and I will never let you take the dagger, you hear...



With that I conclude, my epic of a proposal,

though Approval is much appreciated,according to some magazines, I should be open to hear some refusal..

and with all due respect, please hurry, my knees are starting to quake,

I love you, please say yes,that's the only option, as my life's yours to take...|||
