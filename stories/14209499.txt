 Favorite Scene to dance in (USA or Internationally) A hall of fame (sometimes HOF) is a type of museum established for any a field of endeavor to honor individuals of noteworthy achievement in that field. In some cases, these halls of fame consist of actual halls or museums which enshrine the honorees with sculptures, plaques, and displays of memorabilia. In other cases, the hall of fame is more figurative, and simply consists of a list of names of noteworthy individuals maintained by an organization or community. "...This is a neat idea!"
