Suppose we have an event and we want to prove that the event occurred after a particular date, we have a few easy ways of doing so. For example, one may just show a snapshot of a newspaper with a particular date and headline, indicating that the event is at least after that day. Or we could put in the ending stock price in a particular exchange of a particular date to say that it was after the end of trading hours of that day. This could be as fine grained to the second after the time when the exchange closed.

How to do the converse ? How can one say that an event occurred before a particular point of time ? One could depict large events (skyline of NYC to show various before or after WTC) and geological changes, but that is a very large-scale measure. Is there a much more fine-grained way to depict the fact, of the granularity of a few hours or days ?|||
