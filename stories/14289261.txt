If JavaScript is a language you like, or are interested in, please inform your fellow members of the JavaScript community; this page can't be emptied without your and their participation.

These are currently not implemented in JavaScript. Please implement some if you can. If any tasks are not possible or too complex in JavaScript, they should not be on this list. To mark a task as such, add {{omit from|JavaScript}}, preserving the capitalization of the language, to that task. It will appear below under the "Not Considered" section. 



These tasks as drafts, meaning they largely need more work to turn them into full tasks. Perhaps you can help by trying to implement them in JavaScript (after all, one of the key requirements for a task being non-draft is multiple implementations, preferably in widely different languages) but be aware that this may be difficult because of lack of definition of the task itself. 



These tasks have implementations in JavaScript, but somebody, somewhere, decided that the example implementation was faulty or in some other way requiring attention. If you're familiar with the task and language, please consider reviewing/correcting the example and removing the notice.

These are other pages related to JavaScript which require attention; with your knowledge and assistance, we can improve the quality of the site's content.

These tasks are not generally counted toward "unimplemented", as somebody, somewhere, decided that JavaScript was inappropriate for these tasks, or implementations of them would be unenlightening. Feel free to try your hand at them anyway.

Again, feel free to try your hand at any of the tasks listed on this page.|||
