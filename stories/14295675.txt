At ECCC 2010, I gave a presentation on Jonno Downes' new BASIC extenders, which provide support for writing network programs on the Commodore 64 inÂ BASIC. I prepared a little web server for the demo, and you can see it viewed in a browser on the left, with bits of the source code on the right. You can click on the thumbnails to see larger images, but for all the exciting details, see the presentation slides. If you want to experiment with the code from the presentation, here are D64 images of the web server and the simple remote shell. The code is just a rough demo, so play around with it and see what you can do!

The latest version of KipperBASIC is 1.27. You can also check out the source code over at SourceForge.

Jonno has started a discussion thread at Retrohackers, so check there for updates and support.|||
