Running KDE Neon inside a Docker container on KDE Neon sounds pretty weird.. Or does it?



UPDATE - Jonathan Riddell updated the Ruby script I attempted to use in this video. If you follow the directions on the KDE website with the latest version of the script, everything should work great right out the box! - https://community.kde.org/Neon/Docker



Remember that running a KDE application inside a Docker container really only make sense for developers and system testers, not end-users. Applications running in Docker do not have direct access to the host's file system.



In short, you shouldn't open an image in Gwenview running inside Docker unless the image was also inside your Docker container. Same goes for text files in Kate, etc.



The great part about this is if you wanted to add a feature to Dolphin but you didn't want to break your system, you would hack on Dolphin running inside a Docker container. Sure you could use a VM but Docker containers are so much more lightweight.
