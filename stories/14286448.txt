What if my house burns down? Don't worry, with Cloud by Daplie you can choose to automatically backup data over the Internet to another device securely. Keep one at home and the other at the office (or Uncle Ted's).

There is no limit to the number of people you can share with or give access to on your Cloud system. You own it. Cloud is similar to having your own personal social network. You don't limit the number of friends you have! There are no charges for users. You decide who can have access and what level of access they receive. Each user has a unique login. We provide the hardware and infrastructure but you own the network.

What kind of internet do I need? Any broadband connection will do. Cloud connects to your home's modem or router directly via a normal Ethernet cable, which provides the most reliable and fastest access. If you live in an HOA which does not provide access to Ethernet, you can use a WiFi-Ethernet bridge. Satellite connections that are not always-on or that have strict upload limits may cause difficulty accessing Cloud or streaming movies. Dial-up is not supported.

When will I get my Cloud Server? Cloud units will begin shipping in Summer 2017. We've had a lot of interest and are already working with one of the highest-quality server manufacturers in China to get Cloud ready. Your specific ship time will depend where you are in the pre-order line. So, pre-order now! As we begin production we will provide updates on all relevant shipping information.|||
