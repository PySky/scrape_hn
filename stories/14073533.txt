A micro JavaScript library used as a replacement for jQuery, weighing in at nearly 5KB.

The aim of this project is to build a library that can be used to replace jQuery. The challenge will be to shrink the overall filesize of the library, keeping the minified, gzip compressed file under 5KB while simultaniously adding more support for jQuery features. The ultimate goal is to have a modern library that runs faster than jQuery under stress.

This project is in beta and has been tested in Chrome 51+, IE8+ (using ie-shim.js), Safari 9+, and iOS 6+. Use at your own risk.|||
