Back in late 2015 I invested in two OWC Thunderbay 4 units incorporating eight 8TB HGST 8TB Ultrastar He8 enterprise-grade hard drives, which cost a pretty penny. Those drives are still serving me well.

Hard drives prices have been relatively stable, but HGST now has a Deskstar NAS series which makes the 8TGB models particularly attractive with 8TB now having the lowest cost per gigabyte versus its 6TB and 4TB siblingsâ€”no more cost premium per gigabyte.

Hard drives slow down as they fill up, so even if capacity needs might fit into 6TB, an 8TB drive is a better long term investment.|||
