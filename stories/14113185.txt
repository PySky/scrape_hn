The success of any business depends on products and productivity.  Productivity depends on a successful sales strategy and a strong culture. But what if your sales force is getting distracted by too many responsibilities? They are not about to deliver their best.

Yes, you heard me right. As with your customers, your sales team can (and will) have their own worries and aches. Because sales reps are as good (and as demanding) as their own customers when it comes to buying, it’s very important to find out the best sales tools to help them get rid of their misery.

Here are a few common examples of pain points and complaints among sales teams:

The more human the tools are the more knowledge the sales reps will gain from their clients. Here are some tools that can help boost your sales strategy:

Having a lot of choices often makes people confused and funneling down to the right alternative can take a lot of time. A survey report by Accenture PLC shows that 55% of salespeople have faced more challenges than before while using their company’s sales tools to improve their performance level.

Again, 59% of all surveyed sales reps think that they have too many sales tools to get acquainted with. To overcome the indecision, SlideShare is here to help you.

I would say that keeping alternatives to a minimum is probably the best strategy in this case. It is always advisable to go with the personal human element when solidifying a bond between sales agents and visitors.

The agents will automatically be rewarded with information about the client’s needs when they successfully gain their trust, personally. Try keeping required tools in one platform as much as possible.

Customers are more likely to remain on your site when they get acquainted with your company’s tools and believe that your salespeople can fulfill their requirements by listening to them heartily.

Sales-friendly tools are out there to heal your wounds. Choose your healer wisely and you’ll see the results.
