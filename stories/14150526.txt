C++ structures provides a way to store many different values in variables of potentially different types under the same name. It makes the program more modular, which is easier to modify because its design makes things more compact. Structures are useful whenever a lot of data needs to be grouped together e.g. they can be used to hold records from a database or to store information about contacts in an address book. In the contacts example, a struct will hold all of the information about a single contact for example name, address, phone number etc.

structName is the name of the entire type of structure which is optional and members are the variables within the struct, structureVariables are one or more structure variables which is optional.

The dot (.) operator is used to access any member of a structure. Dot operator is used between the structure variable name and the structure member that we are going to access. struct keyword is used to define variables of structure type.

Output of the above program will be

The typedef Keyword can be used to define structures.

Now Contacts can be used to directly define variables of Contacts type without using struct keyword.|||
