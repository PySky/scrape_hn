Late in 2016 Google announced that the next major redesign of YouTube would be powered by Web Components and the Polymer library. Now the company has made the new version available, but it is not yet the default.

This shows how Google continues to hedge it's bets and take use of it's commanding browser market share to push native web technologies, in addition to JavaScript based alternatives like the Company's own Angular, Facebook's React and the independent Vue library.

To access and study it the new preview of the next generation Youtube preview is available globally for users who opt in via the campaign site at youtube.com/new and use the Chrome browser.|||
