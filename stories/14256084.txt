The Enjade team is looking for a logo to represent the future of the Unity desktop, and we need your help! We want you to design the next logo for Enjade!

When I first started this project back in April, I had no clue as to how the entire project would play out. I thought that I would be by myself on it, having to create and maintain an entire environment with little to no help. After all, I do see comments regularly that show that usersâ€™ disliking of the Unity desktop project. To my surprise, I was wrong; currently, there are ~30 members in the Telegram group for the Enjade Project, some base ideas for how the entire project will roll out, and an article on OMG! Ubuntu featuring the project.|||
