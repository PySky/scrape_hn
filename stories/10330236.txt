Analytics track you, but they also keep local files really useful for forensics to gather evidence against you.

Because of course, you need to know if people actually use it when it's developed by a PR firm. Google Analytics tracks a lot of your moves and stored locally in a cache then uploaded to Google servers. Every action is logged.

Free forensics! Unencrypted file accessible when phone booted of everytime the user opened and closed the app.

I really don't see the point of not using classes for protecting the data at rest, and not only when phone is shut down. The app has no database, just storing everything in the preferences file using NSUserDefaults. Another useful aspect is that they store the last locations in plaintext there too. See more below

An app review can't be done without a screenshot from SSLLabs. No PFS or TLS1.2 support.

I've quickly looked at the clients that contain things you wouldn't really expect from an app supposed to provide security. To be fair here, these details matter far less than having the server-side audited and pentested. I think some architectural changes should be done to give less incentive to an attacker to compromise the server-side. Currently all personal information, locations, check-ins are available on the servers, in plaintext. This is a goldmine for multiple nation states if the app takes off. Just imagine the information that would be contained in that data dump. I hope they will open-source the backend too.

Bro, do you even JSON/ProtocolBuffer?|||
