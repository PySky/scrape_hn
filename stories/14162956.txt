Would you like to finally find success working from home? Would you like to do more than just get by? Today we are talking about how to hustle your way to making $5,000 per month or more. Learn from these examples and use them as inspiration when devising your own work at home success plan.

There is an endless need for those with great research and grammar skills. There is an endless and ongoing list of businesses and websites hiring freelance writers to create blog posts, articles, social media updates, educational materials and more. The opportunity is there and maybe waiting for YOU!

Gina from Horkey Handbook was able to create a full-time income by freelance writing in just a few short months allowing her to finally quit her day job. Last year was her first year as a full-time freelancer and she grossed over $100,000. Gina says putting yourself out there is key. Apply. Apply. Apply. Gina launched her first course last year sharing her knowledge and strategy to becoming a freelance writer.

This was one of the hottest home business opportunities of 2015 in my opinion. I quickly became a fan of the operation and its huge potential. And when I say “huge,” I mean HUGE. Jessica from over at The Selling Family has seen over $40,000 in profits in just one month from her FBA sales. When it comes to sourcing products to sell, Jessica says liquidation and surplus stores are a goldmine. There is some investment and risk involved with this one. Lucky for us, Jessica has a few courses I highly recommend to new sellers including her popularAmazon Bootcamp.

For those with knowledge to share and a passion to get them through the learning curve, blogging holds a lot of potential. I make well over $5,000 per month from my blogs, but it did take time. And it probably took a lot more time than necessary as I tried to figure everything out on my own. But, I stuck it out and am reaping the rewards today.

Your first step in creating a profitable blog is choosing a topic you love. Don’t start a blog about something simply because you think someone else is making money from the topic. You’ll be dead in the water from burnout before you make your first dime. Pick a subject you’d talk about for free because you probably will be for awhile.

Next, get yourself set up with a catchy domain and hosting. I purchase my domains from GoDaddy. While I am now hosting with Flywheel, Hostgator is a great user-friendly place for beginners. The only other must-have I’d recommend from Day One is a newsletter service. I use AWeber, but you can get a free account from MadMimi if you are on a budget.

Michelle over at Making Sense of Cents earned over $5,000 last month managing the blogs and social media accounts of others. If you are a blogger yourself, you have a desirable, marketable skillset that can help boost your income. This is something I talk about in great detail in my new course The Blogger’s VA. This is a great opportunity to maximize your online profits. If you want to work as a virtual assistant, let people know you are a virtual assistant. Too many could-be successful freelancers sit around waiting for clients to come to them. Go out there and get them!

There is big bucks to be made as an “infopreneur.” And despite what you may be thinking, the only people making money this way are not just people talking about how to make money this way. Abby from Just a Girl and Her Blog has diversified her product offerings this past year and it’s paying off. Yes. She still makes a good chunk from Building a Blog Framework, but many months her income from her life planner and organization printables meets or exceeds those numbers. (People are lovin’ printables right now!) Scrappy Courses from By Regina has some really impressive workshops in the infopreneur arena. Though not available on Scrappy Courses, I really loved Regina’s 3-Day Create Course.
