Searx is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. Additionally, searx can be used over Tor for online anonymity.

Get started with searx by using one of the public instances. If you donâ€™t trust anyone, you can set up your own, see Installation.|||
