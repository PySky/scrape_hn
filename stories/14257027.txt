Having lived in Paris and spending many summers France, this is often my reaction when my fellow Americans ask me, "what exactly is French food?"

What most of them really mean (I hope)Â is that French recipes are notoriously complicated. That is, you can't just boil up some pasta and unload a can of tomato sauce (no disrespect to Italian food) and say, "voila!" Quick thought experiment: what came first, the consensus that pasta is easy to make or fact that everyone just happens to have pasta and tomato sauce lying around their kitchen? I want to show that french food isn't necessarily more difficult to make, people just need to be inspired to cook with common ingredients they likely already have at home.

Oui. But who wants to manually input each ingredient one by one?|||
