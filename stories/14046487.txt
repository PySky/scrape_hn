You have to survive as long as possible to an always increasing number of enemies.

on title screen, use Z/X, C/V or N/M to start a new game.

 to pause game and access option menu, press P or return.

key control:

 → arrows: move your spaceship (you can invert y-axis in the pause menu)

 → Z/C/N: launch missile (if the target "lock" is red, the missile will go automatically on it)

 → X/V/M: fire bullets (your bullets will hit something if the target is red)

 → Z+X / C+V / N+M: ©LASER BEAM OF DOOM (pump spaceship energy, do not abuse!)

mouse control:

 → cursor move: move your spaceship

 → left button: fire bullets

 → right button: launch missile

 → left+right button: ©LASER BEAM OF DOOM

0.9.2 update:

 → a brand new and deadly weapon! the mighty ©LASER BEAM OF DOOM

 → full mouse support! now you can get rid of the keyboard to play

 → even more code optimizations, now the game run mostly at 60fps!

0.9.1 update:

 → you can be a real pilot and choose to invert y-axis (option in the pause menu)

 → code size and speed optimizations (i removed almost all COLOR() calls!)

there is some tokens free, i will try to add some feature later if possible.

feel free to report me any bugs!|||
