101Domain has been one of my favorite places to buy ccTLDs for years and along with having the biggest selection of ccTLDs out there they also have really good pricing. One thing I’ve always appreciated about 101Domain is that they’re always adding new features and innovating to make the experience better for their users and last month they did it again with a brand new domain search feature that (pardon my french) kick ass.

Today we’re introducing you to our new and improved search. Our team has been working really hard on this and we are excited to show it to you and we hope after this you are just as excited about it as we are. Our goal with this search redesign is to make it easier for you to find your perfect domain name you can get on with doing the things you want to be doing, like creating your online web presence.
