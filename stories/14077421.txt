The Web We Can Afford Community Group has been launched:

In order to join the group, you will need a W3C account. Please note, however, that W3C Membership is not required to join a Community Group.

This is a community initiative. This group was originally proposed on 2016-01-21 by Alexandre Monnin. The following people supported its creation: Alexandre Monnin, Valerio Basile, Yaso Córdova, Delfi Ramirez, Miroslav Vacura, Jack Jamieson, Diego Landivar. W3C’s hosting of this group does not imply endorsement of the activities.

The group must now choose a chair. Read more about how to get started in a new group and good practice for running a group.

We invite you to share news of this new group in social media and other channels.

If you believe that there is an issue with this group that requires the attention of the W3C staff, please email us at site-comments@w3.org|||
