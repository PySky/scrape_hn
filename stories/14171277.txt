VRML allows to create "virtual worlds" networked via the Internet and hyperlinked with the World Wide Web.

Aspects of virtual world display, interaction and internetworking can be specified using VRML without being dependent on special gear like head-mounted devices (HMD). It is the intention of its designers to develop VRML as the standard language for interactive simulation within the World Wide Web.
