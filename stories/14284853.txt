The A470 & A480 Aztek airbrushes have the capability to be single or double action with a control dial for paint flow. Below you will find the features of these airbrushes and the accessories that the each set contains.

We’ve combined the ease and flexibility of the Aztek premium airbrush design with a quality triple-chrome-plated body to create the new A4809 Metal Body Airbrush. Forged from alloy, the double action internal mix A4809 weighs in at 30 grams, giving it the substantial weight of a metal airbrush with the feel of the Aztek design. As with other Aztek airbrushes, the A4809 features the patented quick-change, easy to clean nozzle system. Add to that the full range of tips, paint cups, bottles, gravity feed color cups and accessories, and you’ve got a modern heavy-duty airbrush system that provides both precision paint application and excellent durability.|||
