I am designing a new venture capital project, focused on complex technologies and taking better care of founders.

In this video I do my best to explain the deep conceptual models and strategic insights behind the project, so that you can follow along with my thinking step by step, validate the assumptions, and decide if you agree with the thesis. It takes nearly an hour. You won't be bored.



A very quick summary? VR/AR, AI, blockchains, and the IOT/robots/drones/cars nexus are all exploding. We'd like to fund projects which work on the interfaces and combinations of these technologies: drones+blockchains, AI+AR etc. We will cultivate a realist, stoic approach to the slings and arrows of founder life, and do not lean too hard on optimism to get people through! - Vinay Gupta (http://ethereum.org, http://hexayurt.com)
