All of Jay Z’s albums have mysteriously disappeared from Spotify and Apple Music. Only three compilation albums remain: Apple Music has 2002’s Best Of Both Worlds and 2004’s Unfinished Business—which both feature R. Kelly—as well as 2004’s Collision Course with Linkin Park. Spotify is missing the Linkin Park collab album as well. Even Watch the Throne is no longer available. Obviously all of Jay’s albums remain available on Tidal. All albums are still available to purchase on iTunes, however.

There’s no explanation for why the music was removed, but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When he first purchased TIDAL in 2015, Jay took his Blueprint series off other services, making them TIDAL exclusives. Eventually, his entire catalogue returned to Apple Music and Spotify, only to be taken down again. The goal of TIDAL was to give the artist more control over their music; limiting his music to one service seems to go along with that idea. Business seems to be going well for Tidal, as Sprint purchased a 33 percent stake in the company for $200M earlier this year.

While Spotify and Apple Music subscribers can no longer stream his music, everyone can still catch up on all the lyrics to Jay Z’s catalog on Genius now.|||
