``WML is the Unix toolkit for getting

   your webdesigner's HTML job done.''

WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation toolkit for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2). It is written in ANSI C and Perl 5, built via a GNU Autoconf based source tree and runs out-of-the-box on all major Unix derivates. It can be used free of charge both in educational and commercial environments.

WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level features built on top of the backends core languages.

While not trivial and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real hackers always wanted for HTML generation.

A typical use case of WML today is the generation of HTML-based static pages for archivable documentation. Recently we implemented an electronic "systems operations handbook" for a German fellow who enjoys semi-automatic information updates through embedded Perl.

WML is a free HTML generation toolkit for
Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2). It internally
consists of 9 core languages and a set of additional include files. The main
idea of WML is a sequential filtering scheme where each language provides one
of 9 processing passes. So WML reads an input file, applies passes 1-9 (or
optionally only the passes specified) and finally produces one or more output
files.
