In this video I'm going to show you how to build a chat application using Angular 2 and socket.io. The example app is currently running on my localhost 8000 and every time I type a message its going to get printed on the other screen. And the way that I'm doing this is I'm using websockets with socket.io. 



I'm only using one server, which is the nodemon server. The first thing I want to do is open up 2 command prompts and cd into our examples folder. Then I'm going to clone our ng2_boilerplate repo. I'll be using gulp in order to copy over all my frontend files into our public folder.|||
