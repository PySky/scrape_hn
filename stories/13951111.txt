Is BackstopJS for you?

Responsive layouts are very difficult to test. It's arguably more tedious to (re)view all of a project's screen elements at every breakpoint than it is to code them in the first place. If you develop responsive UI, you know the worst thing ever is when you've developed a beautiful, rock-solid, responsive CSS layout only to accidentally and un-knowingly hose it by adding a new module or putting in a last-minute tweak. :-/

If that sounds familiar then you are in the right ballpark... BackstopJS is a dead-simple way to add another line of defense between you and those unpredictable CSS curve-balls.

BackstopJS may be just the thing if you develop responsive CMS templates (e.g. Wordpress, Drupal), landing pages, static sites, or dynamic web-apps where one greedy selector can wreak havoc on your otherwise well behaved UI.|||
