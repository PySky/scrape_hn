tsuru PaaS’s server 1.2.0 and client 1.2.0 were released last week.

This release marks the introduction of some major features on tsuru, such as, docker swarm experimental support and support for provisioning and managing nodes on a large number of different clouds (by using docker machine). The detailed release notes are here.

This release also marks the deprecation of tsuru-admin and crane clients. All commands have been fully migrated to and merged on tsuru-client. Read the official release here.

We have also redesigned our release process, making it easier and less error prone to generate tsuru’s releases and also added support for rpm packages. Our packages are now available on packagecloud.|||
