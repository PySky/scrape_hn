The foremost thing that sets Datomic apart is that it accumulates immutable facts over time. Most databases assign values into named locations (a field in a particular row, a node in a particular document), and as those values change, the new values overwrite the older ones. Datomic tracks the entire history of a fact and allows you to access its previous states quickly and easily.

Secondly, Datomic is really a decomposed database: instead of a single monolith handling reading, writing and storing your data, those functions have been parceled out to multiple, interdependent components, each of which runs in a separate process. The components of a running Datomic installation will be some combination of:

A running Datomic system consists of some or all of these processes running simultaneously. This decomposition means you can distribute reads across multiple processes that do not conflict with each other, or with writes, thereby providing horizontal read scalability. The transactor process acts as a single authority for inbound transactions, which is what allows the system to be ACID compliant and fully consistent.

Third, Datomic leverages existing storage systems. This means that your data can be safely persisted in a known, trusted storage service, and you can migrate to alternative services in the future as your needs change.|||
