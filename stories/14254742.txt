To grow a successful YouTube channel and turn yourself into a famous, profitable YouTuber is hard. Very hard! You need to be constantly creating interesting content to keep your followers engaged and to retain those who had just found you for the very first time. However, many YouTubers follow a very different approach that takes almost no effort and it is also highly efficient — they steal others’ videos and re-upload them to grow their own channels. And that is your starting point!

Relax, I‘m not telling you to steal others’ videos. That’s wrong and totally unethical. But it happens you could be the one whose videos are being stolen and re-uploaded hundreds of times to other channels or platforms, specially Facebook. You may be one of hundreds of victims of freebooting and that… is terrible! There may be thousands (or even millions) of people watching your videos, enjoying your content but, unfortunately for you, they are not in your channel so, you’ll earn nothing from it. This is outrageous! But… what if you could track all those videos and claim their views as yours? That would be awesome right? Well, I will teach you a new trick that may change your life for good!

This trick seems like magic but I can ensure you it is very real. By using reverse video search tools, such as Spotter, you can now track and find any video on the entire web (not only on YouTube) and know exactly in which platforms they are getting more views. Those views belong to you so you have the right to claim them (and as a YouTuber you know how important views are for your channel’s growth).

The freebooters hunt season is now officially open! After all the effort you had, it’s now time to stop those who are stealing from you and get you what is yours by right!|||
