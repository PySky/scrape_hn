Creator of popular card game “Cards Against Humanity” Max Temkin vowed that if Congress voted to attack net neutrality, that he would purchase Congress’ browser history and publish it.

The vote ultimately decided that Internet Service Providers will be permitted to sell off their customers’ private data to advertisers.

Or, perhaps, to companies whose founders want to humiliate those responsible for this massively unpopular decision.

Rather than donating to crowdfunding efforts hoping to inflict similar humiliations, Temkin has encouraged citizens to save their money. He plans to purchase and release the data himself.

Republicans in the Senate voted to undo the Obama-era protections last week, and the decision will now go to Trump’s desk.

As the ACLU and other activists groups put it: “President Trump now has the opportunity to … show he is not just a president for CEOs but for all Americans.”

The White House said last Tuesday that it “strongly supports” the new measures and Trump is largely expected to pass it.

But the actions of Mr. Temkin lend credence to the dire warning given by the campaign director of activist group Fight for the Future: “Congress should know by now that when you come for the Internet, the Internet comes for you.”
