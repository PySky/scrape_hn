Do you send lot of emails ? Sometimes people are busy and don’t reply and you have to remind them. Even you are busy and you also forget.

What happens then ? We all know.

It’s as simple as adding a 1day@remindmebro.com in the bcc and it will remind you after 1 day to do the followup

Similarly you can add in the bcc
