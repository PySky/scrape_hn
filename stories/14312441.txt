Both Inflation and Dark Energy are enormous patches to solve problems with Big Bang Theory. There was another, much earlier patch that doesnâ€™t get much attention, but should.

 When it was first apparent that redshift is directly proportional to distance in all directions, this suggested that we are at the exact center of the universe. Then the argument became that space itself is expanding, based on the premise of spacetime. The problem with this is that the central premise of Relativity is the speed of light remains Constant to the distance. Yet if the light from those distant galaxies is being redshifted, it cannot be Constant to this intergalactic distance, but is taking longer to cross, as the universe expands. This means there is one metric of space, based on the redshift of this intergalactic light, that is increasing and it is being compared to a stable metric, based on the speed of the same light. More lightyears, not expanding lightyears.

 We are though, at the center of our point of view of the universe, so there might eventually be some consideration for an optical explanation of redshift.|||

In a recent article for the magazine, three physicists took aim at a prevailing theory of the early universe. Other scientists didn't like that.
