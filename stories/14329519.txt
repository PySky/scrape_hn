A lot of gossips had been buzzing around, in the past about the LeEco Le X920, and now its again in the news. The alleged phone is listed on Geekbench, with mid-range specifications, which is also rumored to be launched as LeEco Le Max 3. Well here, its specs are very much coinciding with its earlier rumors.

As per the Geekbench listing, the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 820 chipset, which is accompanied by 4 GB of RAM. Moreover, the device is expected to run on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS. In the bench-marking assessments, the Le X920 scored 1774 points in the single-core test and 3955 points in the multi-core test.

Over a week ago, the live images of the Le Max 3, turned up on Slashleaks. It revealed some of its key specs, such as the Snapdragon 820 chipset, with 2.15 GHz Quad-Core processor; 6.3-inch QuadHD display; and 64GB of internal storage, apart from allowing us to take a look at the Le Max 3.

Last year, the Le Max 2 handset was launched with a model number of Le X820, and it apparently led to the allegation that the Le X920, will be the Le Max 3. Further, the Le Max 2 packed 4GB and 6GB of RAM, in two different variants; and hence, we can also guess to get the Le Max 3 with 6GB RAM options.

But, recent rumors have suggested that the phone will be made available for purchase, from the second quarter of 2017, at a price of 1,388 Yuan ($201).|||
