Have you ever wanted to do a bouncy animation like one of these on Android? If you have, you’re in for a treat!

Dynamic-animation is a new module introduced in revision 25.3.0 of the Android Support Library. It provides a small set of classes for making realistic physics-based view animations.

You might say “whatever, I’m just gonna slap a BounceInterpolator or an OvershootInterpolator on my animation and be good”. Well, in reality these two often don’t look that great. Of course, you could always write your own interpolator or implement a whole custom animation – but now there’s a much easier way.

At the time of writing this post, the module contains just 4 classes. Let’s take a look at their docs descriptions:

As you can see the package is currently quite small. If you’re looking for something a bit more complex in terms of spring dynamics, take a look at Facebook’s Rebound library.

DynamicAnimation doesn’t extend Animation, so you won’t be able to just replace one or use it in an AnimationSet. Don’t worry though, the whole thing is still very simple.

To get started, add the following dependency to your module’s build.gradle:

The following code is written in Kotlin (give it a try if you haven’t yet!).

Well, it won’t really be generic in a programming sense, but let’s start with how every SpringAnimation is made.

I moved the creation code into a simple utility function to make the code in these examples a bit more readable:

The view’s scale value can go below 0 during the animation (i.e. if you scale it up too much before releasing).

 If you look closely at the above animation, you’ll see that it flips the Android upside down for a split second. 🙃

SpringAnimation makes it quite easy to implement some basic dynamic animations. It’s a nice option, as a little bounciness can help break that linear monotony of a generic Material application. But as with any animations – be careful not to overuse them or you might drive your users crazy!|||
