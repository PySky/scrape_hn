Public bodies in Britain really don't learn from their mistakes.

They whole Boaty McBoatface saga and the lesser known Gritty McGritface incident should've taught them not to trust the public â€” ever.

But the Isle of Wight council clearly hasn't followed our advice:

Last Friday, they posted on Facebook a picture of their new, state-of-the art, modern floating bridge, calling for the public to come up with a name for it. The best six suggestions before April 7 will be put to the public vote.

Yes, there are some exceptions, but rest assured that the overwhelming majority of the 2,000 comments on the Facebook post (I've carefully checked 'em all) call for a plebiscitary vote on Floaty McFloatface.

That said, considering how they cruelly dismissed Boaty McBoatface, later degraded to some yellow submarine, I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to assign the name Floaty to some life float on board.

Ah, and there's also a petition now.

Are there more interesting things to talk about? Yes.

Could have this been avoided? Yes.

Is it time to kiss goodbye to earth and sail our way to the stars and never look back? Probably yes.|||

Isle of Wight council asks public to come up with a new name for shiny new ferry, and the public delivered.
