Ruby Best Practices is for programmers who want to use Ruby as experienced Rubyists do. Written by the developer of the Ruby project Prawn, this book explains how to design beautiful APIs and domain-specific languages with Ruby, as well as how to work with functional programming ideas and techniques that can simplify your code and make you more productive. Ruby Best Practices is much more about how to go about solving problems in Ruby than it is about the exact solution you should use. The book is not targeted at the Ruby beginner, and will be of little use to someone new to programming. The book assumes a reasonable technical understanding of Ruby, and some experience in developing software with it. The book is split into two parts, with eight chapters forming its core and three appendixes included as supplementary material. This book provides a wealth of information on: Driving Code Through Tests – covers a number testing philosophies and techniques. Use mocks and stubs Designing Beautiful APIs with special focus on Ruby’s secret powers: Flexible argument processing and code blocks Mastering the Dynamic Toolkit showing developers how to build flexible interfaces, implementing per-object behaviour, extending and modifying pre-existing code, and building classes and modules programmatically Text Processing and File Management focusing on regular expressions, working with files, the tempfile standard library, and text-processing strategies Understand how and why things can go wrong explaining how to work with logger The book is open source, released under the Creative Commons NC-SA license.

The Book Of Ruby is a free in-depth tutorial to Ruby programming. The Book Of Ruby is provided in the form of a PDF document in which each chapter is accompanied by ready-to-run source code for all the examples. There is also an Introduction which explains how to use the source code in Ruby In Steel or any other editor/IDE of your choice plus appendices and an index. It concentrates principally on version 1.8.x of the Ruby language. The book is divided up into bite-sized chunks. Each chapter introduces a theme which is subdivided into sub-topics. Each programming topic is accompanied by one or more small self-contained, ready-to-run Ruby programs. Strings, Numbers, Classes, and Objects – getting and putting input, strings and embedded evaluation, numbers, testing a condition: if … then, local and global variables, classes and objects, instance variables, messages, methods and polymorphism, constructors, and inspecting objects Class Hierarchies, Attributes, and Class Variables – superclasses and subclasses, passing arguments to the superclass, accessor methods, ‘set’ accessors, attribute readers and writers, calling methods of a superclass, and class variables Strings and Ranges – user-defined string delimiters, backquotes, and more Arrays and Hashes – shows how to create a list of objects Loops and Iterators – for loops, blocks, while loops, while modifiers, and until loops Conditional Statements – If..Then..Else, And..Or..Not, If..Elsif, unless, if and unless modifiers, and case statements Methods – class methods, class variables, what are class methods for, ruby constructors, singleton methods, singleton classes, overriding methods and more Passing Arguments and Returning Values – instance methods, class methods, singleton methods, returning values, returning multiple values, default and multiple arguments, assignment and parameter passing, and more Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas – explains why they are special to Ruby Symbols – symbols and strings, symbols and variables, and why symbols should be used Files and IO – opening and closing files, files and directories, copying files, directory enquiries, a discursion into recursion, and sorting by size Marshal – offers an alternative way of saving and loading data Threads – shows you how to run more than one task at a time Debugging and Testing – covers the interactive ruby shell (IRB.exe), debugging, and unit testing Ruby on Rails – goes through a hands-on guide to create a blog Dynamic Programming – self-modifying programs, eval magic, special types of eval, adding variables and methods, and more The book is distributed by SapphireSteel Software – developers of the Ruby In Steel IDE for Visual Studio. Readers may copy or distribute the text and programs of The Book Of Ruby (free edition).

The Little Book Of Ruby The Little Book of Ruby is a step-by-step tutorial to programming in Ruby. It guides the reader through the fundamentals of Ruby. It shares content with The Book of Ruby, but aims to be a simpler guide to the main features of Ruby. Strings and Methods – including embedded evaluation. Details the syntax to Ruby methods Classes and Objects – explains how to create new types of objects Class Hierarchies – a class which is a ‘special  type ’ of some other class simply ‘inherits’ the features of that other class Accessors, Attributes, Class Variables – accessor methods, attribute readers and writers, attributes create variables, calling methods of a superclass, and class variables are explored Arrays – learn how to create a list of objects: arrays including multi-dimensional arrays, Hashes – create, indexing into a hash, and hash operations are covered Loops and Iterators – for loops, blocks, while loops, while modifiers, and until loops Conditional Statements – If..Then..Else, And..Or..Not, If..Elsif, unless, if and unless modifiers, and case statements Modules and Mixins – including module methods, modules as namespaces, module ‘instance methods’, included modules or ‘mixins’, including modules from files, and pre-defined modules This book can be copied and distributed freely as long as the text is not modified and the copyright notice is retained.

Kestrels, Quirky Birds, and Hopeless Egocentricity collects Reg “Raganwald” Braithwaite’s series of essays about Combinatory Logic, Method Combinators, and Ruby Meta-Programing into a convenient e-book. The book provides a gentle introduction to Combinatory Logic, applied using the Ruby programming language. Combinatory Logic is a mathematical notation that is powerful enough to handle set theory and issues in computability. In this book, the reader meets some of the standard combinators, and for each one the book explores some of its ramifications when writing programs using the Ruby programming language. In Combinatory Logic, combinators combine and alter each other, and the book’s Ruby examples focus on combining and altering Ruby code. From simple examples like the K Combinator and Ruby’s .tap method, the books works up to meta-programming with aspects and recursive combinators. The book is published under the MIT license.

The book is broken down into several sections and is intended to be read sequentially. Getting started – shows users how to install and begin using Ruby in an environment Basic Ruby – explains the main features of the syntax of Ruby. It covers, amongst other things, strings, encoding, writing methods, classes and objects, and exceptions Available modules covers some of the standard library This book is published under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.|||
