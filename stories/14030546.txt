Starting today, Tuesday, 4 April 2017, the Sunshine Period for .africa domain registrations is now open. The period will end on 2 June 2017.

According to Registry Africa, during the sunshine period trademark owners can secure domain names matching their registered trademarks before .africa is made available to the public. Furthermore, a Trade Mark Clearing House will first validate the registered trademarks. Alternatively, and specifically for the .africa top-level domain, a Mark Validation System will be used to validate trademarks which are not yet registered, company names, trust names and common law trademarks (as well as registered trademarks for trademark proprietors who do not wish to validate through the clearing house).

“General availability should commence on 4 July, and this is when the general public can apply for their .africa domain names,” said Lucky Masilela, CEO at ZACR.|||
