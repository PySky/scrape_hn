For a third year in a row, Apple tops Interbrand's Best Global Brands top, with a 43 percent increase in brand value from last year's results.

According to Interbrand's report, Apple managed to boost its brand value from last year's $118 billion to $170 billion, after a 43% year over year increase.

The next in the top is Google, with a $120 billion brand value and a 12% yearly increase from the previous $107 billion valuation.

The only other company that managed to beat Apple's 43% increase in brand value is Facebook, with a 54% increase and a $22 billion brand value appraisal, following last year's huge 86% brand value increase.

This is Apple's third year in a row in the first position, and it seems that it's getting farther and farther away from Google each year, with the difference between them increasing every time Interbrand releases a new edition of their top.

After the $5 billion difference in valuation between Apple and Google in 2013, Apple has gained $5 billion more in 2014, distancing itself at a comfortable $50 billion from Google in the 2015 release of Interbrand's Best Global Brands top.

The rest of the top 10 positions are occupied by Coca-Cola, Microsoft, IBM, Toyota, Samsung, GE, McDonalds, and Amazon, with Apple's brand value surpassing the combined one of the last four companies in the top.

As Jez Frampton, Interbrand’s Global Chief Executive Officer says, "The Best Global Brands report examines what it takes for brands to succeed in today’s hyper-fragmented world. As people demand immediate, personalized and tailored experiences, business and brands need to move at the speed of life."

Interbrand estimates a brand's value using a company's products and services' financial performance, how much of an influence the brand has on its customers' choices, as well as how much power that specific brand has to justify a premium price for the company's products.|||
