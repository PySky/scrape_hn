We enable the additive revolution by providing innovative 3D printing solutions for digital production. With your help, we will become the world’s leading 3D printing company in two years.

3YOURMIND has gained significant growth since its founding in 2013. The company started off as a spin-off of the Technical University of Berlin with three founders. Now only two years later, we already employ 28 people. A second branch in Wrocław was opened last year. Due to investments of renowned businessmen such as Dr. Hans Langer (Founder and CEO of EOS GmbH, Europe's largest 3D printing manufacturer) and winning various innovation awards, 3YOURMIND has managed to attract sustainable attention and helped bringing 3D printing technologies closer to businesses and clients.

We have a high performance and agile development team. We’re using scrum methodologies to develop an amazing product.

Join us and help our team become the number one in 3D printing.

We look forward to your resumé including your CV, your earliest possible start date and your expected salary. Please send all details to jobs@3yourmind.com - we can't wait to hear from you!|||
