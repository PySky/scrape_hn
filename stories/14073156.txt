The daily stand-up is the ceremony with the highest anti-pattern density among all scrum ceremonies. Learn more about the stand-up anti-patterns that threaten to derail your agile transition.

Typically, a good scrum team needs about five to ten minutes for a stand-up. Given this short period, it is interesting to observe that the daily stand-up is the scrum ceremony with the highest potential anti-pattern density. The anti-patterns range from behaviors driven by dysfunctional teams to apparent failures at an organizational level.

My favorite stand-up anti-patterns are as follows:

Depending on the context, it could also be an anti-pattern if the product owner – or even another stakeholder – is introducing new tickets to the current sprint during the stand-up. This behavior may be acceptable for priority one bugs. (Although the team should be aware of those before the stand-up.) However, it is an unacceptable behavior – and thus an anti-pattern – for changing priorities on the fly in the middle of a sprint.

Lastly, some teams like to have stand-ups in Slack, particularly those that are not co-located. Again, depending on the context, this does not need to manifest an anti-pattern per se. I was even working with a co-located team that used Slack as their preferred way of having a stand-up. It worked.

A lot of agile practitioners tend to consider stand-ups to be a candidate for waste. However, from a scrum master or agile coach perspective stand-ups offer the highest yield of anti-patterns – given the effort is so small by comparison to other ceremonies.
