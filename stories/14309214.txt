The most challenging aspect of building a product with a front-end framework is focusing on the complexity of the tool rather than the complexity of the actual problem being solved. Itâ€™s perhaps more frustrating when the tool is complex but the problem is a simple one (e.g. complex webpack config for a todo app). The term progressive, is used by Vue.js to describe how this challenge can be mitigated. Building a basic demo or small app? Vue.js is simple enough to handle that. How about a complex enterprise app? Vue.js is capable of produce cutting-edge solutions, as well.|||
