 from the patch me cos you can dept. Errata for OpenBSD 6.1 and 6.0 have been announced. The message to [from T.J. Townsend ( )] reads: Errata patches for dhcpd, vmm, LibreSSL and softraid have been released for OpenBSD 6.1 today. Details can be found on this page: https://www.openbsd.org/errata61.html Binary updates for the amd64 and i386 platforms are also available via the syspatch utility. Note that syspatch uses the mirror configured in /etc/installurl, so all mirrors may not have the files yet. OpenBSD 6.0 is only affected by the softraid issue. A patch for it can be found here: https://www.openbsd.org/errata60.html It's time to get (sys)patching! Due to a mistake in creating the syspatch archives, a multi-processor machine would not default to the MP kernel. New syspatches have been re-rolled and you're advised to revert and re-apply them (even on non-MP machines). Make sure your mirror (/etc/installurl) has the new syspatches first (dated May 3rd). As root: while true; do syspatch -r || break; done syspatch If you're running on a multi-processor machine, you may also remove the extra /bsd.mp kernel. Sorry about that and thank you all for your report and feedback.|||
