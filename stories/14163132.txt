Travel time means the time it takes for your moving team to drive to you and back to the depot again.

It’s a separate cost to the actual working and transportation time. Travel time is calculated based on the distance from our depot closest to you. To keep the costs low, we have many depots throughout Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

For example: A lady would like two awesome MetroMen to move her furniture from Mornington to Brighton in Victoria.

Travel time to start the job in Mornington is 30 minutes (from our Frankston depot) and the actual work (loading, driving to the delivery and unloading) takes about 3 hours.

 Then there’s another 15 minutes of travel time to return the truck back from Brighton to our Caulfield depot:

30 minutes (Frankston depot to Mornington)   +   3 hours (working time)   +   15 minutes (from Brighton to Caulfield depot)

 =

 3.75 hours (3 hours and 45 minutes)

 X

 $139 per hour (two men and a medium truck on a Monday to Saturday)

 =

 $521 total charge
