Read this blog post first: PDD in Action

0pdd.com is a hosted service that finds new "puzzles" in your repository and posts them as GitHub issues. To start using it just create a Webhook in your repository just for events with payload URL and content type.

Then, add @0pdd GitHub user as a collaborator with read-only access to your repository.

Then, add a puzzle to the source code (format it right).

Then, something and see what happens. You should see a new issue created in your repository by @0pdd.

Don't forget to add that cute little badge to your , just like we did here in this repo (see above). The Markdown you need will look like this (replace with GitHub coordinates of your own repository):

The only way to configure 0pdd is to add file to the root directory of your branch (see this one as a live example). It has to be a YAML file with the following optional parameters inside:

Section allows you to specify a list of email addresses which will receive notifications when PDD processing fails for your repo. It's a very useful feature, since very often programmers make mistakes in PDD puzzle formatting. We would recommend you use this feature.

Section allows you to specify users that will be notified when new PDD puzzles show us. By default we will just submit GitHub tickets and that's it. If you add subsection there, you can list GitHub users who will be notified.
