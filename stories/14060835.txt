Ember isn't just about making developers more efficient. It's about empowering a wider audience to become creators and developers. How do we bridge the gap between our vibrant community and the next million people who have things they want to make but have no idea how to even collaborate with us? 

We already have the foundations of great content-creation tools that will allow authors, site builders, themers, and devs to speak the same language and build higher together. What if anyone could ship their own first app with no coding, but with the power of Ember's community under the hood?|||
