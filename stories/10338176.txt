This is what the Indo-Pak border looks like at night from space.

Nasa shared a photo of the international border between India and Pakistan as seen from outer space on their Facebook page on Sunday.

An astronaut aboard the International Space Station took this nighttime panorama while looking north across Pakistan’s Indus River valley. The photo was taken on September 23 with a Nikon D4 digital camera using a 28 millimetre lens.

The photograph shows one of the few places on Earth where an international boundary can be seen at night. The winding border between Pakistan and India is lit by security lights that have a distinct orange tone.

Another photo, which was shared by Nasa in 2011, shows the border zone looking southeast from the Himalaya.|||
