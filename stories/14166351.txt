A city in China has launched a new method to help tackle jaywalking.

The traffic police bureau in Shenzhen City, south-east China has installed a face-recognition system at a crossroad to help catch any jaywalkers.

The technology dubbed as 'robocop at crossroads' will put the offender's image on a loop on the screen and save it in the police department's database.

According to theÂ People's Daily Online, the technology was set up at a crossroad near Peking University Shenzhen Hospital on April 15 as part of a trial run.

A display screen has been installed at the side of the road and at the pedestrian island.

Chief officer Li Qiang at Shenzhen Traffic Police Technology Department told reporters that the technology mainly relies on the camera to detect a pedestrian crossing during the red light.

By using face-recognition technology, the camera captures the offender's face and sends it to the display screen, as well as the police bureau's database to run diagnostics to identify the person.

The monitor display is operating in real-time meaning that head-shots of any offenders will upload instantly and run on a loop.

The system will also record the number of times a person has run a red light.

The new facial recognition technology has brought an effect of public shaming, however, officer Li said it serves as a function of giving out a warning, sourcing evidence and promoting road safety.

Shenzhen traffic police department released a press release on March 16 showing a record of 123,200 cases of jaywalkers throughout 2016.

Officials are hoping to roll out the technology to the whole of Shenzhen city in the near future to help reduce the figures.|||
