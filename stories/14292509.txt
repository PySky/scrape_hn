Thank you to everyone who made it to our latest roundtable meet-up of The Product Group at Digital Ocean, as well as to our other sponsors, Yext, BKLYN and many more.

Over the course of the night a few of the highlights were…

Featured Product: Spacious

exploring the product, its challenges and successes, from the human layer to living in analytics



The Product Group meet-ups are an opportunity for Product People (managers, strategists, marketers, etc.) to come together to meet, interact, and network in a roundtable setting. It’s awesome to meet fellow Product People in a laid-back, conversational gathering. If you are a Product Person and are interested in having your product featured or participating as a featured guest expert at an upcoming meetup of The Product Group, contact me (or email at jhorn (a-t.) tpgblog DoT com). I am looking forward to seeing everyone at our next meetup… Stay tuned for more announcements about June’s Featured Product, Hackerati.
