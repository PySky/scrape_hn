Gamers always love a challenge, and this weekend, it was more than a challenge. It was the largest PC gaming tournament in Kenya, and gamers did not disappoint.

The event was sponsored by ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG), a brand of ASUS, the largest gaming PC manufacturer in the world.

Eyes were glued to the screens as both player and observer watched as the competition unfolded. In the end however, APEX came through and won the tournament.

This is the first gaming tournament of this magnitude and professionalism in Kenya. It is also proof that the video gaming community in Kenya is huge and active.

According to ASUS, this was just the beginning of the gaming revolution in Kenya and we can expect to see more in future. According to the company representatives, the next event will have a total of twenty teams competing for the ultimate prize.

ASUS also took the opportunity to launch their new gaming laptop, ASUS GL753, now available for pre-orders from Text Book Centres.

The company hopes to continue working with the local gaming community to grow the ASUS ROG Kenya eSports gaming brand. ASUS also hopes the new machines unveiled will help grow the enthusiastic local PC gaming community that came out on Saturday to show support to the event.
