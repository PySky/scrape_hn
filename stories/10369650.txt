Today is a very exciting day. We’re pleased to announce that Medium has launched a Publishing API.

We’ve built a great tool for writing. But it’s not our editor that creates the main value — Medium is, first and foremost, a network for connecting people and ideas.

With our Publishing API, you can now share your story on Medium from anywhere. It’s easier than ever to plug into our network and build your audience here. There are so many amazing stories, ideas, and perspectives shared here every day, and we want to make reading on Medium even better, with more avenues for content creators of all shapes and sizes.

For those who’ve already started things of your own, the Medium Publishing API gives you an easy way to share your content here too.

These stories, published on Medium from elsewhere, can now take advantage of our unique interaction layer. Our community of writers and thinkers will highlight, respond to, and recommend your work.

Reading on Medium is unique, because here you’re not alone. You can read, interact, and collaborate with others in our revamped iOS and Android apps. Your consumption experience is shaped by the people you follow, which is really powerful and provides more context when reading.
