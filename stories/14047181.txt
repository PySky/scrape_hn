Comments. This page, written by David Applegate, produces a MIDI file for the sequence using the settings shown.

 Changing the A-number in the first window will play a different sequence (although it will not change the page heading). 

 Pitch modulus + pitch offset should be < 129, duration modulus + duration offset should be < 6.

For other ways to listen to sequences, try Jonathan Middleton's     web site.|||
