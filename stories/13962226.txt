Website for my niece. I decided to make this as a gift to my sister and brother-in-law. Other than the website, which is a standard jekyll website with little content as of now, I was inspired by this Google Ad, where parents send their daughter emails as she is growing up. I wanted to replicate something similar.

I used migadu for email hosting. I wanted a reasonably cheap service, and one I can trust to be around for a while. I really like their stance on privacy and other matters (like how they have a drawbacks page).

Also, if you want to try this, I'd recommend against using GMail for your kid because google doesn't allow kids to create accounts

It automatically let me create the standard admin emails ( ).|||
