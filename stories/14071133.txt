Using and shared sedge configuration files requires trust. A malicious sedge configuration file can be used to construct an SSH configuration file which does harmful things. Only use against trusted URLs under your control, or under the control of someone you trust.

Sedge reads and uses it to generate .

No output is generated if all goes well. Use the flag to get verbose output, including a diff of any changes made to your .

Below is an example sedge configuration file. It has the same syntax as an OpenSSH configuration file, but uses some additional keywords. Sedge keywords begin with an '@'.

Sedge allows you to associate names with your keys. It is helpful to list the keys you have, and their fingerprints, so you can give them names using the :

If any of your keys do not have public keys alongside them (eg. ), sedge will generate the public key file.

Sedge gives you a helpful shortcut to load all of your keys into :

- this keyword defines the names of variables which must be passed if this file is included from another. Each will be made available for substitution.

- this keyword applies to the current Host stanza. It requires that only the key will be offered to log into the host. This is useful if you are using a host such as github which has a common user account, and identifies you based on the key offered.

- include the sedge file at . That file may define one or more arguments with , which should be passed through as arguments to .

- this keyword applies to a Host stanza. All attributes set within the stanza with name will be applied to the current host.

- this keyword applies globally, and the keys you define are made available to files included with . Your directory will be scanned for keys matching . To find the fingerprint for your keyfiles, run .

- this keyword applies globally within the current file. The is made available for subsitution within the file.

- this is a convenience keyword. It expands to a directive which allows the SSH login to bounce through .

- this keyword applies to the next Host stanza. The will be made available for subsitution within the stanza, and the stanza will be repeated for each possible value of . Values of the format or are treated specially, and are expanded to the inclusive range of integers from to with optional step . If multiple keywords are applied to a Host stanza, the product of their values is used for substitution.
