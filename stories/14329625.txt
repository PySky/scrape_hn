I think everyone has thought about what the difference between BRIDGE and HOST modes to run containers, except run applications with the same port. To test network performance we need 2 instances:

I chose http://software.es.net/iperf/ to measure the network bandwidth. Very simple and have enough features to check basic metrics. On the server instance, we require the docker. I tested against Docker 1.12.6 version.

First, we need to get the original stats without docker containers. Running on the server instance:

and on the client machine:

Both server and client would return useful information. For now, we need only the result values:

I use instances and AWS limit the network to 500 Mbit/sec, here we have a bit more: 740Mbit/sec.

To run in the docker is quiet simple. There are a lot of images available in the hub.docker.com.

From client side there are no changes, only I changed the default ports depends on how we run the server

The results are pretty the same: 740 Mbit/sec.

This time I used next port. So you can run in same time all servers and do tests.

From client side there are no changes:

OK. We have only 580 Mbit/sec. It is 80% of the maximum allowed. When we did test few years ago, for older versions of docker we had 50%.

There is no risk of reaching or exceeding the maximum throughput of your network by running an application inside the docker. Result table:|||
