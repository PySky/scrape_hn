The proper way to use fetch(), using resposne.text() to parse text response , and resposne.json() to parse json response from the server:

and import it in the entry of Node.js server

As my experience, fetch() is so easy to use and saves me so much time in building isomorphic website, however it is too quiet when there is error or exception is happening, takes me a lot of time to find out the bug.

The way I experimented fetch(), is creating a simple Express.js server, with 5 different situation : 

1) response text with 200 status code

2) response json with 200 status code

3) response text with 400 status code

4) response json with 400 status code

5) response whatever result in a certain long time (timeout)

To found out what is actually happening inside fetch() when I use the incorrect method to handle those situation.

It goes to exception|||
