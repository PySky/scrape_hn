The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has issued an alert to consumers and merchants about the security risks involved with EMV Cards. An EMV card is a credit or debit card with a microchip that helps protect cardholder data. However, EMV cards may still be vulnerable to exploitation.

US-CERT encourages consumers and merchants to review the IC3 Alert for information on EMV card vulnerabilities and proactive defensive measures.|||
