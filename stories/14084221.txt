If the page uses a production/minified build of Vue.js, devtools inspection is disabled by default so the Vue pane won't show up. To make it work for pages opened via protocol, you need to check "Allow access to file URLs" for this extension in Chrome's extension management panel.

Currently only a Chrome devtools extension is available.

Get it on the Chrome Web Store.

Make sure you are using Node 6+ and NPM 3+|||
