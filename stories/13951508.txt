Cognitive Behavioral Therapy seems like the most effective treatment. App/website based programs for sleep are available (see the bottom of the document).No good evidence for Chinese herbal medicine“The study suggests that a brief course of evening bright-light therapy can be an effective treatment for early-morning awakening insomniacs who have relatively phase advanced circadian rhythms.”“Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia.”Large effect size using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in insomnia for early morning awakening, small for total sleep time“Low to moderate grade evidence suggests, while very low grade evidence suggests benzodiazepines are more effective in the short term.”“However, adequate trials of combined behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy are the best course of management.”“stimulus control therapy and relaxation and cognitive therapies have the best effect sizes”“The evidence for [cognitive therapy] intervention is the strongest”What is relaxation therapy?“Relaxation-based interventions are based on the observation that insomnia patients often display high levels of arousal (physiological and cognitive), both at night and during daytime.[ 33 ] Relaxation methods are used to deactivate the heightened arousal system, and the selection of a specific technique varies depending on whether physiological or cognitive arousal is targeted for treatment.andtechniques seek to reduce somatic arousal, whereas attention focusing procedures such asandare intended to lower presleep cognitive arousal (e.g., intrusive thoughts, racing mind). Additional relaxation therapies (e.g., abdominal breathing, meditation, hypnosis) have also been advocated, but currently there is no evidence to support their use in the clinical management of insomnia with less than modest effect sizes ranging from 0.81 to 0.83 for sleep latency, 0.25 to 0.52 for total sleep time, and 0.06 for wake after sleep onset.[ 31 32 ] As is the premise for most self-management skills, all these relaxation techniques require regular practice over a period of several weeks, and professional guidance is often necessary in the initial stage of training.”What is cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia?“Cognitive therapy seeks to alter faulty beliefs and attitudes about sleep.[ 34 ] For example, insomniacs "often display a great deal of apprehension about bedtime and performance anxiety in their attempt to control the process of sleep onset; some even entertain catastrophic thinking about the potential consequences of insomnia, all of which may heighten their affective response to poor sleep." The objective of cognitive therapy is to cut short the vicious cycle of insomnia, emotional distress, dysfunctional cognitions, and further sleep disturbances. Examples of treatment targets for cognitive therapy include having unrealistic sleep expectations (e.g., "I must get 8 hours of sleep every night"), misconceptions about the causes of insomnia (e.g., "my insomnia is entirely due to chemical imbalances in my body"), amplifications of its consequences (e.g., "I am going to fail after a poor night's sleep"), and performance anxiety resulting from excessive attempts at controlling the sleep process.[ 35 ]”What is stimulus control therapy?“Stimulus control therapy is based on the premise that insomnia is a conditioned response to temporal (bedtime) and environmental (bed/bedroom) cues that are usually associated with sleep.[ 28 ] Accordingly, the main objective of stimulus control therapy is to train the patient to "re-associate the bed and bedroom with rapid sleep onset by curtailing sleep-incompatible activities (overt and covert) that serve as cues for staying awake and by enforcing a consistent sleep-wake schedule." Stimulus control therapy consists of the following instructional procedures[ 29 ] consisting of going to bed only when feeling sleepy, using the bed and bedroom only for sleep and sex and nothing else like watching TV, getting out of bed and going into another room whenever unable to fall asleep or returning to sleep within 15–20 minutes and returning to bed only when sleepy again, maintaining a regular rising time in the morning regardless of sleep duration the previous night, and avoiding daytime napping.”Mean effect sizes (ESM) for each variable calculated from sleep diaries ranged from medium to large with regard to(ESM = 0.67),(ESM = 1.09),(ESM = 0.70),(ESM = 0.74),(ESM = 0.80), and(ESM = 0.89)ACT, actigraphic evaluation; CI, confidence interval;, early morning awakening; ESM, mean effect size; FU, follow-up; k, number of studies; PSG, polysomnogram;, sleep efficiency;, sleep onset latency; TST, total sleep time;, total wake time;, wake after sleep onset., time in bed“Psychological and behavioral interventions are effective and recommended in the treatment of chronic primary and comorbid (secondary) insomnia. (Standard)These treatments are effective for adults of all ages, including older adults, and chronic hypnotic users. (Standard)These treatments should be utilized as an initial intervention when appropriate and when conditions permit. (Consensus)Initial approaches to treatment should include at least one behavioral intervention such as stimulus control therapy or relaxation therapy, or the combination of cognitive therapy, stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy with or without relaxation therapy—otherwise known as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). (Standard)”“These findings suggest that young and middle-age patients with sleep-onset insomnia can derive significantly greater benefit from CBT than pharmacotherapy and that CBT should be considered a first-line intervention for chronic insomnia.”“In most measures, CBT was the most sleep effective intervention; it produced the greatest changes in sleep-onset latency and sleep efficiency, yielded the largest number of normal sleepers after treatment, and maintained therapeutic gains at long-term follow-up.”CBT was better than drugs!For info on how to do relaxation, stimulus control, etc: http://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults Exercise, CBT and relaxation therapy have 'A' strength evidence.“Full CBT was associated with greatest improvements, the improvements associated with BT were faster but not as sustained and the improvements associated with CT were slower and sustained. The proportion of treatment responders was significantly higher in the CBT (67.3%) and BT (67.4%) relative to CT (42.4%) groups at post treatment, while 6 months later CT made significant further gains (62.3%), BT had significant loss (44.4%), and CBT retained its initial response (67.6%).”“There were no statistically significant differences between sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and insomnia severity index for internet-delivered versus in-person therapy with a trained therapist.”“In conclusion, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in improving sleep in adults with insomnia.”“In conclusion, internet-delivered CBT-I appears efficacious and can be considered a viable option in the treatment of insomnia.”“Compared with controls (C), subjects in the exercise training condition (E) showed significant improvement in the PSQI global sleep score at 16 weeks (baseline and posttest values in mean [SD] for C=8.93 [3.1] and 8.8 [2.6]; baseline and posttest values for E=8.7 [3.0] and 5.4 [2.8]; mean posttest difference between conditions=3.4; P|||
