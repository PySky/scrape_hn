...is a set of libraries to compose synchronous and asynchronous collections and Array#extras style composition in JavaScript

The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript (IxJS) is a library for creating and composing asynchronous sequences using both the and classes.

The class a way to create and compose synchronous collections much like Arrays, Maps and Sets in JavaScript using the Array#extras style using the familiar methods you are used to like , , and more.

Alternatively, we can use the statements to iterate our collections.

Instead of bringing in the entire library for , we can pick and choose which operators we want, for bundling concerns.

We can also bring in only the operators that we want to using just the operators themselves. Many of these operators take a simple source such as an , , or generator function such as our and functions.

The object implements the iterator pattern in JavaScript by exposing the method which in turn exposes the class. The iterator yields values by calling the method which returns the class.

The object is based off the ECMAScript Proposal for Asynchronous Iterators. This would allow us to create asynchronous collections of Promises and be able to use such methods as the , , and other Array#extras methods that you are used to using.

Much like with the object where we can iterate through our collections, we can use instead which allows us to iterate over the asynchronous collection.

Instead of bringing in the entire library for , we can pick and choose which operators we want, for bundling concerns.

We can also bring in only the operators that we want to using just the operators themselves. Many of these operators take a simple source from functions such as the and functions.

The class implements the async iterator pattern in JavaScript by exposing the method which in turn exposes the class. The iterator yields values by calling the method which returns a Promise which resolves a class.
