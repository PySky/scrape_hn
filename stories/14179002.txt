This is the English (default) interface for . VisuAlgo is now an almost multi-lingual site. Try visiting the other versions of VisuAlgo, e.g. ; ; ; ; or (see ). If you want to volunteer to help the translation work by translating at least 100 sentences/strings in your local language, contact us at visualgo.info at gmail dot com (currently focusing on 9 languages only: zh, es, pt, ru, de, bn, ja, ko, vi).

In VisuAlgo, you can use your own input for any algorithm instead of the sample inputs. Try graph drawing feature in these 6 graph-related visualizations: , , , , , and . You can also click tag 'graph' in any of these 6 graph-related visualization boxes or type in 'graph' in the search box.

To compare 2 related algorithms, e.g. on the same graph, open 2 VisuAlgo pages in 2 windows and juxtapose them. Click to see the screenshot.

You can visualize the recursion tree (or DAG, if there are overlapping subproblems and Dynamic Programming (DP) is applicable) of ANY valid that can be written in JavaScript. Click to see the screenshot.

VisuAlgo loads fast for first time visitors, but it loads 'almost instantly' for returning visitors as we cache lots of static content of VisuAlgo :) (please do not use incognito or private browsing mode to keep the cache). Moreover, if you have registered a VisuAlgo account, we will load VisuAlgo according to your preferences after you .

Each visualization page has an 'e-Lecture Mode' that is accessible from that page's top right corner that explains the data structure and/or algorithm being visualized. This e-Lecture mode is automatically shown to first time (or non logged-in) visitors to showcase the data structure and/or the algorithm being visualized. The quality of e-Lecture Mode will gradually be made to reach the lecture standard of algorithm classes in National University of Singapore by end of May 2017 :).

As of 27 April 2017, VisuAlgo has reached a new level. Please check four newest features of VisuAlgo: 1). Multi-lingual capability (you don't have to rely on /en language at all times if you are not native English speaker), 2). User accounts (there are interesting perks and customizations available for loyal users, please ), 3). Much more powerful e-Lecture mode to reach "NUS standard", and 4). Visualizations of NP-hard problems (currently MVC and TSP).

VisuAlgo has two main components: The visualization pages (currently 23) and the Online Quiz component (currently 12 and will be 23 too in the near future). We do not script any of the questions in Online Quiz :O and all answers will be graded almost instantly :). You can try the online quiz at or by clicking the 'Training' button on the visualization module.

Search the term in your favorite Search Engine, do you see VisuAlgo in the first page of the search result :)? Next level: Search that term again, but in your native language (if it is not English). Is VisuAlgo still listed in the first page? :). And get ready to be surprised: Search the name of your favorite data structure or algorithm without mentioning the keyword 'animation' or 'visualization'. Is VisuAlgo still listed in the first page? :):).

VisuAlgo currently receives about ~3800 hits/day from various Computer Science students and teachers worldwide. Although this is a good number, we will keep improving VisuAlgo so that it can be even more useful for much more (new) CS students worldwide annually. Please spread the word if you are our returning visitors ( so that we can know who you are) and like this tool :).

VisuAlgo was conceptualised in 2011 by Dr Steven Halim as a tool to help his students better understand data structures and algorithms, by allowing them to learn the basics on their own and at their own pace. VisuAlgo contains many advanced algorithms that are discussed in Dr Steven Halim's book ('Competitive Programming', co-authored with his brother Dr Felix Halim) and beyond. Today, some of these advanced algorithms visualization/animation can only be found in VisuAlgo. Though specifically designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) students taking various data structure and algorithm classes (e.g. CS1010, CS1020, CS2010, CS2020, CS3230, and CS3230), as advocators of online learning, we hope that curious minds around the world will find these visualisations useful too. VisuAlgo is not designed to work well on small touch screens (e.g. smartphones) from the outset due to the need to cater for many complex algorithm visualizations that require lots of pixels and click-and-drag gestures for interaction. The minimum screen resolution for a respectable user experience is 1024x768 and only the landing page is relatively mobile-friendly. VisuAlgo is an ongoing project and more complex visualisations are still being developed. The most exciting development is the automated question generator and verifier (the online quiz system) that allows students to test their knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. The questions are randomly generated via some rules and students' answers are instantly and automatically graded upon submission to our grading server. This online quiz system, when it is adopted by more CS instructors worldwide, should technically eliminate manual basic data structure and algorithm questions from typical Computer Science examinations in many Universities. By setting a small (but non-zero) weightage on passing the online quiz, a CS instructor can (significantly) increase his/her students mastery on these basic questions as the students have virtually infinite number of training questions that can be verified instantly before they take the online quiz. The training mode currently contains questions for 12 visualization modules. We will soon add the remaining 8 visualization modules so that every visualization module in VisuAlgo have online quiz component. Another active branch of development is the internationalization sub-project of VisuAlgo. We want to prepare a database of CS terminologies for all English text that ever appear in VisuAlgo system. This is a big task and requires crowdsourcing. Once the system is ready, we will invite VisuAlgo visitors to contribute, especially if you are not a native English speaker. Currently, we have also written public notes about VisuAlgo in various languages: , , , , .

VisuAlgo is free of charge for Computer Science community on earth. If you like VisuAlgo, the only payment that we ask of you is for you to tell the existence of VisuAlgo to other Computer Science students/instructors that you know =) via Facebook, Twitter, course webpage, blog review, email, etc. If you are a data structure and algorithm student/instructor, you are allowed to use this website directly for your classes. If you take screen shots (videos) from this website, you can use the screen shots (videos) elsewhere as long as you cite the URL of this website (http://visualgo.net) and/or list of publications below as reference. However, you are NOT allowed to download VisuAlgo (client-side) files and host it on your own website as it is plagiarism. As of now, we do NOT allow other people to fork this project and create variants of VisuAlgo. Using the offline copy of (client-side) VisuAlgo for your personal usage is fine. Note that VisuAlgo's online quiz component is by nature has heavy server-side component and there is no easy way to save the server-side scripts and databases locally. Currently, the general public can only use the 'training mode' to access these online quiz system. Currently the 'test mode' is a more controlled environment for using these randomly generated questions and automatic verification for a real examination in NUS. Other interested CS instructor should contact Steven if you want to try such 'test mode'. This work has been presented briefly at the CLI Workshop at the ACM ICPC World Finals 2012 (Poland, Warsaw) and at the IOI Conference at IOI 2012 (Sirmione-Montichiari, Italy). You can click this link to read our 2012 paper about this system (it was not yet called VisuAlgo back in 2012). This work is done mostly by my past students. The most recent final reports are here: Erin, Wang Zi, Rose, Ivan. Bug Reports or Request for New Features VisuAlgo is not a finished project. Dr Steven Halim is still actively improving VisuAlgo. If you are using VisuAlgo and spot a bug in any of our visualization page/online quiz tool or if you want to request for new features, please contact Dr Steven Halim. His contact is the concatenation of his name and add gmail dot com.|||

VisuAlgo was conceptualised in 2011 by Dr Steven Halim as a tool to help his students better understand data structures and algorithms, by allowing them to learn the basics on their own and at their own pace. Together with his students from the National University of Singapore, a series of visualisations were developed and consolidated, from simple sorting algorithms to complex graph data structures. Though specifically designed for the use of NUS students taking various data structure and algorithm classes (CS1010, CS1020, CS2010, CS2020, and CS3233), as advocators of online learning, we hope that curious minds around the world will find these visualisations useful as well.
