Passwords are vanishing from our lives, being replaced by fingerprints, voice and facial recognition.

Soon one of the most common passwords, your bank card’s PIN number, could disappear too.

This morning Mastercard took the wraps off its latest innovation, a fingerprint-scanning bank card that it’s been quietly testing in South Africa.

From the outside the fingerprint card appears no different from your regular bank card.

But, when paying in a shop, rather than entering your PIN, you simply place your finger on a patch of the card in order to pay.|||

Forget your bank card's four digits (for the last time).
