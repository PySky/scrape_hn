A large church in Alabama is one step closer to creating its very own police force, a move that seems to be unprecedented here in the United States. What’s up guys and welcome to Cops Court and Coffee…I’m Darnell Eason. 



Now the Alabama Senate has voted to allow Briarwood Presbyterian church in Birmingham the right to form its own police force. The 4,000 member congregation received a favorable 24-4 vote from the Senate to allow the church to establish a law enforcement department. 



The church says it needs its own police officers to keep its school as well as its more than 4,000 person congregation safe. 

Of course there are some challengers of this bill, who disagree with the measure stating that a police department that reports to church officials could be used to cover up crimes. 

It should be noted that Alabama has given some private universities the authority to have a police force, but never a church or non-school institution. 



Well that’s all I have on this right now. If I hear more…I’ll bring you more. But for now, comment below and tell me if you would have a problem if your local church had its own police department. Don’t forget to hit that like button and if you didn’t already. Don’t forget to subscribe.
