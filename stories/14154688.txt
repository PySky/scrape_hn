In the United States, electric car charging points have been shown in Apple Maps since last year.

For this, Apple teamed up with ChargePoint and with the companyâ€™s data, he put on the map (literally) all the points where one can load his electric car in the United States.

As Bloomberg points out, Apple has begun to show in the UK these charging points as well as bicycle rental stations.

According to Arne Meusel, CEO, and co-founder of Currants:

We believe that the constant and live information of the growing loader infrastructure increases the confidence of electric car drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new groups of users to sustainable mobility offers. In the UK we started with the support of the main loader operators, including God point, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower, and NewMotion. Any interested operator can contact us.

As for bike rentals, Apple is starting to show these points in London, Paris and New York. In this sense, Google Maps already shows it in several other cities.

As always, it remains to be seen when these improvements will arrive in Apple Maps to Europe and Latin American countries, where we do not even have traffic data for now.|||
