20 April update: Thanks everyone for your amazing entries! It’s really cool to see (and hear!) what you all came up with.

This miniLD will be closing soon, as LD 38 is just around the corner.

Welcome to miniLD 73. This is the final miniLD before Ludum Dare 38 starts on 21 April, which is LD’s 15th anniversary. So this miniLD is a great opportunity to get all your gamedev stuff in order for the big event next month.

Now, as you’ve guessed from the image above, the theme for this miniLD is: MUSIC!

Music is an important aspect of any game. It plays a big role in setting the tone of your game and it has a major influence on the emotions the player is feeling. However, during the short, hectic and rushed dev time of a game jam, it’s sadly often an overlooked aspect. Many LD entries don’t have any music at all and I feel that’s a real shame.

So, this miniLD is a chance for you to focus on music specifically, do experiments and learn how it influences your game. If you’ve never made music before, this is a great way to get started. I’ll put a list of (free) tools at the bottom of this post, in case you’re looking for things you can use to start composing. If you know of other useful things not listed, please share them in the comments below!

You may interpret the theme in any way you want, for example:

– make a game with an awesome soundtrack!

 – create music for a game you had already started!

 – make a music game!

 – whatever you can think of!

MiniLD 73 starts right now and will run until LD38 starts. Don’t wait too long though, because all sorts of LD38 stuff will happen as the event comes closer (theme voting, the slaughter, the warm-up weekend).

So don’t hesitate, and get rocking!
