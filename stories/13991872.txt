Communicate is a free tool that allows teams and individuals to practice communication in an environment outside of their normal teams, roles and projects.



Players have to work together to solve a simple puzzle but it requires coordination. You are encouraged to use the same communication tools you use today (phone, chat, texting, etc.) but screen sharing and video chat of your screen is not allowed.

Communicate uses Google for user authentication.

We will never share any of your information with anyone.|||
