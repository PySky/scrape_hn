Collaborating with Ontario’s academic institutions, other institutes across Canada and companies in every sector of the economy, we will conduct research and drive the adoption and commercialization of AI technologies across Canada. Our goals are to: 1) be a world-leading centre for AI research; 2) graduate the most machine-learning PhDs and masters students in deep learning and machine learning globally; and 3) become the engine for an AI super cluster that drives the economy of Toronto, Ontario and Canada.

The Vector Institute is an independent, non-profit research institution dedicated to the transformative field of artificial intelligence, excelling in deep learning and machine learning – an area of scientific, academic, and commercial endeavour that will shape our world over the next generation.

Launched in March 2017 with generous support from the Government of Canada, Government of Ontario, the University of Toronto and private industry, Vector represents an unprecedented answer to an unprecedented opportunity: the transformative potential of AI in fields as diverse as finance, education, environment and clean tech, retail, advanced manufacturing, transportation and health care.

We are building on a well-established and respected foundation of globally recognized talent and learning that exists today in Toronto. For researchers looking to establish academic careers, students seeking educations in deep learning and machine learning or companies building and looking to staff AI labs, invest in new businesses, or adapt and grow their existing businesses, Vector is the place to come, to be and to stay.
