Revenue hit $52.9 billion, which is 4.6 percent greater than the same quarter last year.

That represents modestly accelerating growth — the second quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue growth.

Apple’s Services business, which includes iTunes and Apple Music among others, was its fastest-growing segment, with an increase of $1.05 billion over the same quarter last year.

The iPhone business, Apple’s biggest revenue source, disappointed. Apple shipped 50.8 million iPhones last quarter, lower than expected. They were responsible for a $390 million increase in revenue compared to a year earlier.

Investors aren’t running away. Shares are only down about 2 percent in after-hours trading, and have recently traded at all-time highs.|||

Solid growth for the Services segment.
