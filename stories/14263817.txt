In a recent time we have seen a show of shame in Nigerian politics through the behaviour of political leaders, and governmental officials. they should be seen as a good example rather than just a figure head in the national assembly, due to their self-centered behaviour, they was unable to addressed the plight of common Nigerians.The political leaders always had a tussle between one another over the issue that will bring a relief to the masses, they prefer fight among themselves rather than sit together and iron the matter in favour of the masses. In no time, we had seen where a senator will throw a chair for another senator of his calipher just because of disagreement over an issue.These trends doesn't stop at national assembly, it is everywhere in as much as is a political gathering. when would this show of shame stop, it show that the political leaders are in the office for the size of their pocket. Even the ward project they award, they are beneficiaries or sub-contracted it to their relatives and friends.The political leaders have involve themselves in various fraud activities ranging from budget padding, sub-contracting, fund diverting, siphon and money laundering. these trend continues even when the anti graft war is still warming, some of the politicians still loot away Nigerian treasury.|||
