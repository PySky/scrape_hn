Injectopi is a set of tutorials that I've decided to write down in order to learn about various injection techniques in the Windows' environment. The idea came to my mind when I noticed these awesome sources by Hasherezade.

Here is what I thought:

This tutorial shows how you can create a program that, when run, will inject code into an existing process. We will show multiple techniques of increasing complexity discovered by security researchers and malware coders. It has to be noted that these list is not complete as it only shows the main techniques!

If you want to compile each binary it is suggested to use:

Make sure to have the components enabled with your Visual Studio installation!

You should be ready to go!

I have commented what the shellcode does in the file .

Here below you can find a list of interesting articles / websites / papers which I found useful while writing down Injectopi!

ReactOS is an awesome project which aims at open-sourcing the Windows OS by reverse engineering it. The documentation you find on their website is pure gold.

skape's "Understanding Windows Shellcode" paper is a great resource that will surely help you understand how Windows' internals work and how to use them to write shellcode.

The shellcode I use in these examples uses some techniques shown in the paper!

Any contribution is very welcome! Feel free to open issues and pull requests!

This project idea was born thanks to Hasherezade's demo repository and the constant support of my instructor Federico Maggi.

Special thanks to my friends Francesco and Giancarlo that helped me review everything!|||
