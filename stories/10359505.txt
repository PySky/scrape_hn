When we started LastPass in 2008, we set out on a mission to provide a smart solution to the growing password problem. We aimed to build a product that helped people efficiently manage their passwords, in a way that not only increased their productivity but also improved their security.

Since then, LastPass has grown by leaps and bounds, helping millions of consumers and tens of thousands of businesses worldwide with password management. We are so incredibly proud of our team’s accomplishments and grateful to the users who have supported us on our journey.

Together with LogMeIn, we’ll be able to accomplish more, faster – providing an even better service to millions of people. As we become part of the LogMeIn family over the next several months, we’ll be releasing updates to LastPass, introducing new features, and continuing to grow the service as we work to bring LastPass to millions more who struggle with passwords.

Again, thank you to all of our users and supporters! We’re as committed as ever to providing you with a secure, easy-to-use password manager. Stay tuned as we open the next chapter of our story with LogMeIn and build the future of identity and access management, together.|||
