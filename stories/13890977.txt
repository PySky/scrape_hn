While a few companies, including Memphis Meats, have produced clean - commonly known as lab-grown - beef, it is believed that this is the first time clean poultry has been created.

“It is thrilling to introduce the first chicken and duck that didn’t require raising animals. This is a historic moment for the clean meat movement,” said Uma Valeti, co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats. “Chicken and duck are at the centre of the table in so many cultures around the world, but the way conventional poultry is raised creates huge problems for the environment, animal welfare, and human health. It is also inefficient.

“We aim to produce meat in a better way, so that it is delicious, affordable and sustainable. We really believe this is a significant technological leap for humanity, and an incredible business opportunity — to transform a giant global industry while contributing to solving some of the most urgent sustainability issues of our time.”

Memphis Meats’ poultry breakthrough was made possible by a new procedure that the company is developing to produce new clean meat products and accelerate clean meat innovation.

The multi-animal platform is expected to allow the company to produce many types of meat and to fine-tune the taste, texture and nutrition profile of its products. The platform will also enable the company to scale up production and rapidly reduce costs.

The team expects to continue reducing production costs dramatically, with a target launch of its products to consumers by 2021.|||
