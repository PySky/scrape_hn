Given an array containing only 0â€™s, 1â€™s and 2â€™s, sort the array in linear time and using constant space.

Simple solution would be to perform count sort. We count the number of 0â€™s, 1â€™s and 2â€™s and then put them in the array in their correct order. The time complexity of above solution is but it requires two traversal of the array.

We can rearrange the array in single traversal using an alternative linear-time partition routine can be used that separates the values into three groups:

To solve this particular problem, we consider 1 as a pivot. Below linear-time partition routine is similar to three-way Partitioning for Dutch national flag problem.

The time complexity of above solution isand auxiliary space used by the program is



 Exercise:

 Modify the program to rearrange the elements in opposite order (in descending order).
