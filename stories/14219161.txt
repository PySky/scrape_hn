As I write this, it's just a bit over ten years since I started working at Mosaic Communications Corporation. In memory of that, here's a piece of history I managed to dig up. When we created mozilla.org and released (most of) the source code to Netscape Confusicator 4.x, Netscape's lawyers made us go through a big "sanitization" process on the source code. Largely this consisted of making sure we had the legal rights to all the code we were releasing, and making sure every file had proper and accurate copyright statements; but they also made us take out all the dirty words. Specifically, "any text containing vulgar or offensive words or expressions; any text that might be slanderous or libelous to individuals and/or institutions." At our release party on April 1, 1998 Pierre Saslawsky was handing out guerilla party favors consisting of a CD-ROM archive of the mcom.bad-attitude newsgroup, and a single sheet of paper with some choice source code obscenities on it from the pre-sanitization tree. I found that piece of paper, and typed it in, below. For comparison, a similar set of searches from the Netscape 3.02 source tree follows. (We didn't search for the exact same sets of words, and I suspect he edited his more heavily than I did, so don't assume that because the second list is longer, the number of obscenities in the 4.x series was lower...) Enjoy it. By which I mean to say, fuck you.
