These are a basic instructions on how to protect Source-Journalist communications from being intercepted and read when they transit the internet using a technique called Public Key Encryption (PKE). By following these instructions, you'll allow any potential source in the world to send you a powerfully encrypted message that ONLY YOU can read even if the two of you have never met or exchanged contact information.

We'll be using GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) through the "gpg4win" front-end program and focusing on emails as the transmission medium, but once you've created your ciphertext, you could send it any way you want: email, IM, blog post, Skype, etc.|||
