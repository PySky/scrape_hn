But recently, there’s been a lot of talk about a new terminal emulator called Hyper , and I had to try it out.

After years of using the default MacOS terminal , I switched to iTerm2 last year for both personal and professional development. It provided the keyboard shortcuts and split panes that were desperately needed in the default MacOS terminal. It continues to be a popular choice for developers who develop on MacOS.

Hyper is an open-source and extensible terminal emulator available on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. It’s built using web technologies, specifically Electron (the same platform that powers Atom, Slack, and Brave). After hearing about it from friends, industry thought-leaders, and coworkers, I decided to download Hyper and make it my new default terminal emulator.

Unfortunately, there are a couple downsides that, for me, heavily weigh against the positives.

I used Hyper for a couple months before running into “The Bad.” While I can deal with some slowness from my text editor, I realized that I don’t have the same tolerance when it comes to my terminal emulator. I decided to switch back to iTerm2 and haven’t looked back since.

That said, if you haven’t given Hyper a try, I still suggest that you download it and use it. I have friends who swear by it, and don’t mind the issues that I ran into. It’s all a matter of preference, and it’s great that the technology community works on a wide variety of tools for us to experiment with and enjoy.|||
