With Guidrr, travel micro-entrepreneurs now can serve and earn income directly from their follower audience. (Like Bloggers, Instagrammers, peer to peer hosts, guides & drivers, and more). Guidrr team started email marketing months before the app launch. Here is an example

Let take some notes from Aassia’s email updates. She is the founder & CEO of Guidrr.

Start your email campaign as soon as possible. I know she started sending weekly email way before the product actually launched. What a great way to build anticipation. Right?
