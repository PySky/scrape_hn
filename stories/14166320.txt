Average Cost of Service (ACS) is another important SaaS metric for finance to track and to educate the company about.  When used in isolation, it doesn’t tell us much.  When used in combination with annual recurring revenue (ARR) and customer acquisition costs (CAC) to name a few, it is very powerful.  It can help answer questions about pricing effectiveness, margins, and payback.

With many SaaS metrics, there are no set definitions or standards.  Your company may have a slightly different business model or department structure that will determine how you calculate ACS and make it relevant to your business model.

I calculate ACS using the following components.

Simply put, I sum up these expenses on an annual basis and divide by customer count to derive ACS.

Once you have ACS, you can run scenarios to determine how your variable and unit costs will change when you add more customers to your cost structure.

Will adding 100 customers drive down your unit costs significantly?  Or will it take 1,000 customers?  Calculating economies of scale helps me answer these questions and educate the leadership team about our cost structure and the impact of customer growth on our unit costs.

Maybe, your customer growth is great but your cost structure is so bloated that your unit costs are not improving like you thought they would – i.e. insensitive to customer count changes.  The Excel model I built helps me understand the balance between cost structure and customer counts.
