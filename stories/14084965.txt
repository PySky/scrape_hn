There are some very popular websites out there that offer to host your content for you. Their pitch is that, by writing on their platform, you’ll have access to a network of other writers and readers. These companies make money—or at least they’ve convinced their investors that they will—by monetizing your content. Think about it: they sell what you write.

If the content you write has inherent value, why not host it yourself? And when I say host it yourself, I don’t mean you need to run the server yourself or be a programmer. I mean, host it somewhere where you control the domain, the content, and the experience. Personally, I like Ghost.

Hosting your own content means you have control over it and the reader’s attention. By writing, you are creating value so harness it instead of giving it away for free.|||
