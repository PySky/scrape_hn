We first learned about Bitcoin in 2012. Perhaps where you'd least expect -- on an island off the coast of Spain in the middle of August -- IBIZA. Our first impression was that this was either going to be really big or a complete zero. We were immediately taken in by Bitcoin's elegance and enormous promise, and as we started to learn more, we became convinced that Bitcoin was the future of money. We began buying bitcoin, but quickly realized that there was no safe and easy way to buy and sell bitcoin in the US! So, a year and a half ago, we decided to do something about it. We began assembling a team of top engineers to build Gemini -- a next generation bitcoin exchange. This past Monday, Gemini opened its doors to the world. We are super excited for Gemini's journey ahead and look forward to sharing it with you. Please AMA, or rather AUA!

EDIT: Thank you Reddit for the interest in our story and hearing what we have to say. It's been a lot of fun answering questions. It's certainly and honor and flattered to be here. We appreciate the fact that you're taking time to learn more about us as people and entrepreneurs and about Gemini. We're working hard to build the next thing, which is Gemini, and super passionate about making sure that Bitcoin reaches its full potential.|||
