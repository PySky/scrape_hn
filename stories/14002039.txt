Europe’s public administrations should support the use of open source in all sectors of the economy and in public administration, a study for the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology recommends. The report by German and French ICT researchers, concludes that “open source is important for the future of the European software industry.”

European policy actions should strengthen the open source knowledge base and the exchange of best practices between private and public organisations, the researchers write. The EU should do more to make clear to European companies, public administrations and users what the advantages of open source software are.

The authors from Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC), Le CXP and Fraunhofer ISI, add that, based on interviews, workshops and surveys, European companies want European policies to increase support of open source.

Published on 5 March, the report ranks open source software as one of the nine key drivers of the European software industry, alongside Big Data, Mobility, Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.
