Developers and beta testers have already had a field day with iOS 10.3, and today it’s your turn to try the new software update.

After seven beta releases, iOS 10.3 is finally here. This dot-release brings with it the ability to track your AirPods from the Find My iPhone app and the switch from the outdated HFS+ system to the new Apple File System. In addition, iOS 10.3 lets you leave reviews in-app and will give developers the chance to reply to your reviews in the App Store.

It’s always important to back up your iOS device before attempting to install any new software, but because iOS 10.3 switches to a new file format, you might run into some unexpected compatibility issues. So, it’s extra important to create a backup this time.

You can back up your device to your computer or to iCloud. Back up to iCloud by going to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup and turning on iCloud Backup.

Back up to your computer by connecting your iPhone and launching iTunes. Select your device in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window, then click on the Summary tab. Under Backups, choose Back Up Now. Check the “Encrypt” box if you want the backup to store your passwords and Health data, which we recommend.

Here’s how to install the iOS update on your device through a Wi-Fi or mobile connection:

The device will need to automatically restart to complete the installation.

You can also install iOS 10.3 via iTunes by connecting your device to your computer. If an iTunes popup doesn’t ask you right away to update, click on your device and choose Summary. Then, click on Check for Update. That should kickstart the installation process.|||

After five beta releases, iOS 10.3 is finally ready for the masses.
