Words matter, particularly when it comes to product design. While most designers have (strong) opinions on the subject, we can all agree that the best product experiences require the perfect marriage of design and type. In service of that, we’re launching Framer Type, a new way to add, edit and even animate text directly in your prototypes. Time to give text the treatment it deserves.

Framer Type is simple. It operates on the same logic as any other Layer, the basic building blocks of our tool. Layers come in all different variations, are fully animatable and seldom static. You can already use layers to create simple shapes, images, videos, and more. Now, you’ll be able to insert a TextLayer, customize it using the code editor and animate it within the scope of your larger project. Type, at your service.

To start, click on Text in the Insert menu of your Framer app. This drops a customizable TextLayer into your canvas, with code to match. Use the editor to customize your text, then click the Auto-Code icon to reposition or resize the layer. When you’re ready to style, switch to the properties panel to play with size, positioning or opacity.

Because Framer is an interactive design tool, our text feature allows for dynamic manipulation. Update content, design interactive buttons, create quick layouts or hook up real-data. No matter how you want to work with text, we support your flow. We’ve also made numeric text properties completely animatable. Looking to transition the fontSize? No problem.

To illustrate the possibilities of Framer Type, here are a few simple prototypes:|||
