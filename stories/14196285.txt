We’ve been testing our design direction from the beginning with actual users to validate and stay on track. .com was hugely helpful for early signal and getting quick qualitative feedback from real users. Building on those positive results, we shipped an initial implementation

Since then, we’ve expanded to hundreds of users, integration partners, and Atlassians and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Any UI change, especially one as large as adopting a new navigation paradigm, involves tough calls and tradeoffs. Based on our research and testing, we’re optimistic that people will intuitively understand the new layout and be even more productive with Bitbucket.

This initial roll out is just the beginning. We’ve started with navigation, updated bitbucket.org, and changes are now starting to flow in to product.

Now after all this testing, it is time to get feedback on a larger scale. We are rolling it out to 1% of our active user base so some of you will already have this experience in your current Bitbucket account. Just click the “Give feedback” link in the sidebar – we’re listening.

If you can’t wait to try the new UI, you can still turn it on! Visit the Labs page and enable “Bitbucket UI refresh”. If you’re not already a Bitbucket user, sign up for Bitbucket to give it a try. Give us feedback and we hope you .
