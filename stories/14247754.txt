NewCo was a startup project I worked on between 2012 and 2103.

 The goal was to provide a place where consumers would share informations about the products they used and loved.

While the technical aspects of building a website did materialize, the financial aspects never did. I've since worked on other projects that you can follow on openbloc.fr

The site is still online as a testimony of what was tried to make an impact at that time. It's part of my portfolio and it could maybe be reused (don't do this, the tech is too old ;) ) or serve to inspire other projects.

The development was mostly done by AGASS007 and me (blaze33).

Nothing's nicer than working code you can actually play with. The stack is old, Django 1.4 was all the rage in 2013. This app has been designed to be easily hosted on heroku and as such I followed the Twelve-Factor App guidelines.

Some recent updates have been made to let it run on the cedar-14 stack, the cedar-10 we used back in 2013 being deprecated. You will need a postgresql database with hstore installed, needs to be installed too.

Request for comments on the above run / deploy part: your feedback is welcome in issue 1

The heroku add-ons used in production are the following ones:

The app is mainly configured by environment variables, the main ones being and .

 The full list of the variables (which may or may not need to be configured) is as follow:|||
