Checks how strong your user's password is via questionably ethical means.

Please don't actually use this.

evilpass check_pass errors check_pass( , , ) errors [ Your password must be at least 8 characters long ]

So quit doing it. Use a password manager. I personally recommend pass.

If you're actually checking user's password strength on sign up, I strongly suggest using an entropy-based strength estimation like zxcvbn instead of contrived composition rules like this, which are explicitly discouraged by NIST's current password guidelines. I also suggest not trying to log into your user's account on other sites.|||
