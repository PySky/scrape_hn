Redis Replicator is a redis rdb and command parser written in java.

 It can parse,filter,broadcast the rdb and command events in a real time manner.

 It also can synchronize redis data to your local cache or to database.

 The below I mentioned which means in redis and excludes (e.g. , )

out ( ( )); rawByteListener () { ( ... ) { { out write(rawBytes); } ( ignore) { } } }; replicator ( , , defaultSetting()); replicator addRdbListener( () { ( ) { } ( , ) { } ( , ) { replicator addRawByteListener(rawByteListener); } }); acc ( ); replicator addCommandListener( () { ( , ) { (acc incrementAndGet() ) { { out close(); replicator close(); } ( e) { e printStackTrace(); } } } }); replicator open(); replicator ( ( ), , defaultSetting()); replicator addCommandListener( () { ( , ) { out println(command); } }); replicator open();

WARNNING: this setting may run out of memory of redis server in some cases.

MUST less than 

 default is 30 seconds
