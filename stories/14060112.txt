Iran has made a considerable breakthrough in biotechnology inasmuch as it is able to produce GM foods and Up until 2013 it has produced 18 different kinds of recombinant medicines.

The modern biotechnology has been established nearly nine decades ago in Iran, started with vaccine production in Pasteur and Razi Institutes in 1920 and 1925. National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology institute of Iran was established in 1989. Iranian scientists are active in various spheres of agriculture in this institute and work on medicinal plants with the aim of using their metabolites or increasing their tolerance to non-biological changes such as salinity or drought. One of the uses of biotechnology is in production of genetically modified foods; however, there are many opposing voices claiming that they are harmful for health.

Simply said, biotechnology harnesses cellular and bi molecular processes and puts them to work for us. It is used for production of GM foods and treating diseases with genetic technologies and many other fields. Biotechnology is an efficient, up-to-date and effective tool in agricultural field. Biotechnology helps you to improve plants' resistance to a considerable amount. Iran is among pioneering countries in this field. Up until 2013, 18 different kinds of recombinant drugs have been produced in Iran. This number is against 50 recombinant drugs produced globally. With the help of biotechnology and recombinant drugs, Iran has seen a 30% drop in its drug export and 50% inflation growth has been controlled.|||
