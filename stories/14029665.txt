Goal-Oriented Action Planning (aka GOAP, rhymes with soap) refers to a simplfied STRIPS-like planning architecture specifically designed for real-time control of autonomous character behavior in games. I originally implemented GOAP for F.E.A.R. while working at Monolith Productions. This A.I. architecture simultaneously powered Monolith's Condemned: Criminal Origins. (Brian Legge was responsible for the A.I. in Condemned). My GOAP implementation was inspired by conversations within the A.I. Interface Standards Committee's (AIISC) GOAP Working Group, as well as ideas from the Synthetic Characters Group's C4 agent architecture at the MIT Media Lab, and Nils Nilsson's description of STRIPS planning in his AI book.|||
