Cat Tracker is also interested in what your cat is eating beside the cat food you give it at home. Cats are natural predators and researchers are interested in seeing what prey they are eating (such as birds and rodents) that could affect the environment. To participate in the diet study, send Cat Tracker a sample of your cat's hair, and a sample of your pet's food and they will analyze it for carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Then, they will compare the isotope signature of your pet's food, with the isotopes in their hair and see if there are differences that would indicate your cat is consuming prey in the wild. Read more about the diet study here . Â Postage should cost you about $4, making this an inexpensive way to participate in citizen science.|||
