For the first question, I've found the answer myself by digging into commit history and trying the new Marshmallow image. The answer is simple:

They removed the (foreground) ripple on touch for bounded , but not for unbounded, leaving this inconsistency deliberately.

I just tested on the Marshmallow image from Android SDK. It is removed, and even worse, they left the exiting ripple in the place user first touched the screen instead of where their finger lifted from the screen.

I cannot understand this design decision since it seems like a regression much more than an improvement to me, but as in the commit log, they believe they did implement bounded ripple animation, instead of removing it.

But for the second question, I still haven't got an answer yet.|||
