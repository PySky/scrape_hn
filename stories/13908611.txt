This is an implementation of word embedding (also referred to as word representation) models in Golang.

Word embedding makes words' meaning, structure, and concept mapping into vector space (and low dimension). For representative instance:

Like this example, it could calculate word meaning by arithmetic operations between vectors.

Listed models for word embedding, and checked it already implemented.|||
