[solo] Disable unbound using IPv6; we don't need it A [bug in Docker 17.04][docker-bug] disabled IPv6 causing helios-solo to crash when trying to run unbound. Unbound tries to open a control/admin port on localhost 8953 and defaults to listening on both IPv4 and IPv6. This change forces unbound to listen **only on IPv4 for all ports**. Strange things: * unbound docs say remote-control->control-enable defaults to no * for some reason unbound can listen to port 53 with IPv6 fixes #1116 [docker-bug]: moby/moby#32433|||
