Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it technically possible to automate many tasks that previously could only be done by a human.

But the complex nature of modern work also means that people don’t just do one thing in their jobs. Workers, and especially white-collar workers, complete a wide variety of tasks at work every day.

This interactive calculator, based on data from the McKinsey Global Institute, gives an indication of how the future of work will change: instead of destroying entire jobs and creating completely new occupations, for the most part AI and automation will simply change what activities people focus on in their work.

Nearly every occupation has some tasks that can be automated, but fewer than 5 per cent of occupations can technically be fully automated using technology that is currently available, according to McKinsey data.

Even for activities that can be technically automated, whether or not it would actually happen is dependent on a number of other factors: the cost of deploying robotic solutions, the economic benefits of doing so, the supply and demand of human labour, and regulatory and social acceptance.

These factors will differ across industries and geographies, and the changes, McKinsey estimates, will take place over decades.

“It takes real effort to integrate technologies and develop solutions that will solve particular business problems,” says Michael Chui, a partner at McKinsey and one of the authors of the report.

“For the many technologies we studied from history, they usually took somewhere between 8 to 28 years between the time of their commercial availability to their eventual plateau in adoption.”|||
