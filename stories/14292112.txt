Industry 4.0 is the same that the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a branch of the Internet of Things, which is dedicated to improve the industry using sensors, actuators, and Smart Objects. As Rakesh_K has said previously, the term has been created by the German Ministry of Education and Research. However, it needs a clarification, because the origin of the Internet of Things was to improve the Industry as the creator of this term, Kevin Ashton, explains in this article, exactly to improve the supply chains. I made at Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Linking the new idea of RFID in P&G's supply chain to the then-red-hot topic of the Internet was more than just a good way to get executive attention The fact that I was probably the first person to say "Internet of Things" doesn't give me any right to control how others use the phrase. You can read more about the IIoT in this survey, Using IoT in the healthcare service industry, for safer mining production, in transportation and logistics, or in firefighting. or here if you want to read about the logistic with RFID and the use of RFID in supply chains.. IOT can affect the whole supply chain. Firstly it can optimize the supply chain management; secondly it can make sources to be used effectively; thirdly it can make the whole supply chain to be visible so that it can improve the information of supply chain transparency; fourthly the supply chain can be managed in real time; the lastly it can make the supply chain high agility and complete integration. IOT affects the supply chain management in manufacturing link, warehousing link, transportation link and selling link. It makes enterprises even all the whole supply change response to the varied market quickly so that the adaptability of the supply chain to market verification changes is improved.|||
