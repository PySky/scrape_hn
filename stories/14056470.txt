Give your photos and video clips a comic book look or drop in animated speech bubbles, arrows, banners, and emojis. The emoji page in the overlays browser displays your recently used emojis, but you can add any emoji to your Clips videos. Simply add an existing emoji, tap to select it, then use the standard emoji keyboard to choose a new one. After that, the new emoji will appear in the overlays browser. You can also add customizable full-screen posters to help tell your story.|||
