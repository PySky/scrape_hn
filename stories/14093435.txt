We wrote about our experiences of being featured on the HN front page here:Essentially US daytime and US weekdays are very high traffic. Therefore your submission would be competing against a lot of competitor posts. Weekends are a little more normal and you may have a better chance of staying on the frontpage for longer.However, saying all of the above, the process is quite random. The key is to pick up karma points quickly otherwise you risk drifting off the frontpage. Avoid any title too misleading otherwise you may be downvoted which guarantees disappearing from the front.|||
