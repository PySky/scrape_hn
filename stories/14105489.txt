Vitaly, thank you so much for your enormous and extremely valuable contribution to PhantomJS! It will be forever remembered as an incredible chapter in history of PhantomJS (and perhaps even FOSS project in general). All the best to whatever you're planning for your next adventure!

 I want to make an announcement. I think people will switch to it, eventually. Chrome is faster and more stable than PhantomJS. And it doesn't eat memory like crazy. I don't see any future in developing PhantomJS. Developing PhantomJS 2 and 2.5 as a single developer is aÂ bloody hell. Even with recently released 2.5 Beta version with new and shiny QtWebKit, I can't physically support all 3 platforms at once (I even bought the Mac for that!). We have no support. From now, I am stepping down as maintainer. If someone wants to continue - feel free to reach me. I want to give credits to Ariya, James and Ivan! It was the pleasure to work with you. Cheers! I also want to say thanks to all people who supported and tried to help us. Thank you! On Thu, Apr 13, 2017 at 2:14 AM, Vitaly Slobodinwrote:
