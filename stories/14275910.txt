Spotify is getting in on QR codes with a new way to share music.

The streaming service recently added "Spotify Codes" into its app. The feature (thanks Moshe Isaacian for sharing with us) is described as "a unique code for everything on Spotify" in a pop-up about the experience.

Spotify users can find codes for each song and then someone else can choose to scan the code on their friend's phone and instantly open the song, artist page or playlist on their own phone.

It's quite similar to Snapchat's Snapcodes, where users can create and share their own QR codes that will then open a page exclusively within Snapchat.

Spotify officially announced the update Monday, championed it as a way to empower artists.

"Spotify Codes are not just great for sharing new music with friends and loved ones, they also present an innovative and exciting new way for artists, labels and brands to instantly engage with fans through Spotify," a blog post on the update reads.

You can find the new QR reader on Spotify clicking on search in the app. Then, you'll see a camera in the top right.

This update is just another way for people to share music on Spotify, as the app looks for more ways to integrate social elements into the experience. Facebook announced an integration with Spotify and Facebook Messenger last month during F8, the network's annual developer conference.
