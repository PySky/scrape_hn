IBM’s messaging capabilities in Bluemix are being brought together under a single service, the Message Hub service. We’re pleased to announce that the next step towards this goal is now complete, with the addition of the MQ Light API.

The MQ Light API is a simple but powerful AMQP-based messaging API for Java, Node.js, Python and Ruby. It allows apps to be written quickly and portably in a unified messaging model that supports both queue and publish/subscribe messaging patterns, enabling scenarios such as worker offload, event notification, and batch processing to be simply written.

By being part of Message Hub, these apps can now not only enjoy the the cloud scale and throughput capabilities of Message Hub, but also tight integration with other Message Hub apps and easy access to further capabilities as these are added, such as on-premises hybrid integration and bridging to other Bluemix services such as analytics.

Apps written using this API can not only be run against the Message Hub service, but also against IBM MQ as part of an on-premise enterprise messaging solution. For further information, see How to migrate from the MQ Light Service to Message Hub and the official Message Hub documentation.|||
