An alien-obsessed student from Brazil has mysteriously disappeared while working on his own secret X-File.

Bruno Borges, 24, vanished from his home in Rio Branco on March 27, leaving behind his bedroom decked out floor to ceiling in “Da Vinci Code”-style alien language and satanic signs, the Mirror reported.

Some of the elaborate writings in the room are passages from the Bible and phrases from Leonardo da Vinci.

A video posted by Globo.com shows a giant statue of 16th-century philosopher Giordano Bruno — who was one of the first to believe that aliens could exist on other planets — which he bought for $2,900 in one corner and a painted portrait of Borges with a green-eyed alien in another.

Borges’ family believes he was working on publishing 14 books written in code and marked with red Roman numerals that he left behind in the locked bedroom.

One of the passages was decoded by a Brazilian computer expert.

“It is easy to accept what you have been taught since childhood and what is wrong. It is difficult, as an adult to understand that you were wrongly taught what you suspected was correct since you were a child,” the passage allegedly says, according to the Mirror.

Borges had asked his family for money to fund his secret project, according to relatives, but wouldn’t provide any details about it. He only told them he was working on books that would “change humanity in a good way.”

Borges’ sister, Gabriela, told Diario Gaucho that he’d locked himself in his room for nearly a month while his parents were away traveling.

“He was clever. In school, he was always different — a born leader with high powers of persuasion,” said his mom, Denise Borges. “He is such a kindhearted boy.”

The Criminal Investigation Department is investigating the disappearance.|||
