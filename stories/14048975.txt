This is an attempt to summarize my observations of a good UX. Mostly I deal with UI. This covers screen audits that have been recently extended to UX design. From time to time I will publish essays regarding the topic of experience within app design. In this short writing Sign In & Sign Up will be covered.

Give an optional login, sign up via existing account from social app (as facebook or gmail) or use phone verification. The last one mentioned is the  most expensive one  in comparison to reusing social app account or even using a password

The more important text fields are better to place on the first page. That way, pages will look more clear and easier to perceive.

Use the login title in a different way. For example, by using more inviting sounds such as “Welcome”

Don't forget about keyboard in designing process. Avoid flexible structure as in general it causes to extend development time.

Introduce sign in/sign up process as an additional option. Don’t set it as a blocker to use an app. For example, to keep data saved or to get full access to all features in the app.
