Swedish open source database management software provider Severalnines has integrated open source database load balancing technology, ProxySQL, with its database management system, ClusterControl, as the company aims at killing load balancing downtime.

Part of a database, load balancers are used as reverse proxies to distribute networks or applications across servers.

According to Gartner analysts, load balancing downtime costs companies an average of $5,600 per minute, or $300K per hour.

By integrating ProxySQL with ClusterControl, Severalnines expects to improve business-critical productivity, bringing downtime disruption to an end and consequently avoiding related costs to downtime.

The provided explained that ProxySQL has an advanced multi-core architecture to handle a large number of connections, multiplexed to potentially hundreds of backend servers.

Vinay Joosery, Severalnines CEO, said: “With the growing importance of load balancers in today’s distributed database environments, ProxySQL has the potential to become an indispensable part of the high-availability stack.

“ProxySQL offers an alternative load balancing technology for MySQL users who need to handle massive amounts of connections.”

René Cannaò, Creator of ProxySQL, said: “The ability of ClusterControl to deploy, configure and monitor the majority of the open-source databases makes it an ideal tool for their complete management.”|||
