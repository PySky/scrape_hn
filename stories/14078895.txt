The Discovery Update is nearly here, bringing with it a wealth of mystery for you to uncover! Hunt secret stashes of loot with cartographer’s maps! Venture into the menacing woodland mansions! Journey beyond the veil of life and return once more with the Totem of Undying!

But there are greater treasures still - made by the amazing Minecraft community and made easily available to you through the all new Marketplace. For the first time, Pocket and Windows 10 players can browse, download and play cool community creations from within the game itself.

We’ve partnered with heroic ‘crafters well-known to the community to build up a launch catalogue of amazing adventure maps, texture packs, minigames and more. Noxcrew, BlockWorks, Qwertyuiop The Pie, Blockception, Sphax, Eneija, Imagiverse, Polymaps and Razzleberry Fox are the folk on board at launch, but we’re opening up submissions to anyone with a registered business.
