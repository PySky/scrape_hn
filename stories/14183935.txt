The log data collected can be from a network made up of 10 nodes or a several hundred of them. The more the machines connected to a network the wider scale of the log. Furthermore, the relevant data out of the logs has to be filtered out for events, applications, network flow, SIEM, and other several security management tools. Unless these metrics are all collected at a unified source, there has to be some mechanism to distinguish the useful information from the petabytes of data that may be collected each day.

Context is important to determine the usefulness of the log data. Contextual information helps define the “who, what and where” for the data and helps determine the relationship of the cause and effect to come to a decision sooner. Not all the log data collected is important or relevant for an event. Correlation of log data has to be established to make it useful in anomaly detection.|||

With business, IT data is growing enormously. Biggest concern for any organization is IT data security. Efficient log management is key to data security.
