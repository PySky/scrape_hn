This Lotus Evora is in the process of being converted into an all electric car, and its dyno tests paint a similar, yet cool-sounding picture.

Equipped with the electric motor from a Tesla Model S and the battery from a Chevy Volt, this Evora is currently being built by Sasha Anis, the founder of Canadian dynamometer building firm OnPoint Dyno. The project has been going on for months, and Anis is finally far enough along to get the car—motor and all—onto a dyno to test it out.

Unlike most dynos, this one is meant to be mounted at the hub at each driven wheel for safer usage and more accuracy. Despite the more direct data consumption method, the computers read 440 horsepower and an absurd 4057 lb.-ft. of torque. We don’t doubt the horsepower number, but we have a hard time believing a Chevy Volt battery could max out a dyno like that.

Whether it measures the data accurately or not, the car sounds awesome on power. The whirr of the motor spinning the axles is more than enough to forgive the mutilation of a perfectly good Evora. We can’t wait to see it on the road.|||
