On certain vehicles, the rivet connections for the constant velocity (CV) joint of the rear driveshaft may have insufficient durability. Over time, this could cause the CV joint to break, resulting in a loss of propulsion which could increase the risk of a crash causing injury and/or property damage. Correction: Dealers will replace the CV joint. Note: This recall supersedes recall 2017-049|||
