[Chorus]

I am part of the master plan

Every woman, every man

I have seen them come and go

Go with the flow



I have seen that we all are one

I know all and every one

I was here when the sun was born

Ages ago



[Verse]

In my mind

I have tried

Catching light

Catching light



In my mind

I have left the world behind



Every time I close my eyes

All of nature's open wide

I can hear her

Talk to me at night



In my mind I have been trying

Catching light outside of time

I collect it in a box

Collect it in a box



Every time I close my eyes

All of nature's open wide

I can hear her

Talk to me at night



[Repeat Chorus]



[Interlude, Einstein recording]

The scientific method itself

would not have led anywhere,

it would not even have been formed

Without a passionate striving for a clear understanding.

Perfection of means

and confusion of goals

seem in my opinion

to characterize our age.
