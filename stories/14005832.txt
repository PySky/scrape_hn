Music written and created entirely using the FOSS apps Lilypond and Linux Multimedia Studio. Nothing else could be so beautiful, we think.

Open source music software never seems to get the attention it deserves, so I was delighted to see this YouTube video created using GNU Lilypond.

Lilypond is under active development and participated in the Google Summer of Code in 2016.

This video led me to the Linux MultiMedia Studio. Suppose Linux were around in the days of Bach, Beethoven and Vivaldi. Do you think they’d be using open source, or would they prefer being stuck in some proprietary program that charged an upgrade fee for every new musical age? Think about how musicians build upon each others’ work so freely and generously. Reminds you of FOSS, doesn’t it?

Better methods yield better results. Think that over and see if you don’t agree.|||
