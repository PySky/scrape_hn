From Nvidia's latest GPUs to Intel's Lake Crest and Google's TPUs, there is a plethora of options for training deepnets.  Should you build your own GPU rig or is it better to use the cloud?  Where should you train models?  What about inference at scale?

This conference will focus on some best practices for deploying deep learning models into production on a variety of hardware and cloud platforms.|||

One day conference co-organized by Startup.ML and Bloomberg for industry
