You only need to pay when it's time to generate your eBook files.

No. You only pay once per title/manuscript. So you can download in ALL formats (mobi/Kindle, generic epub, iBooks, Kobo, Nook) without affecting the price.

No. You only pay once and then you can make as many changes as you want and download as many times as you want.

Nope. Just create a document where the chapter titles are bold or a heading or just labeled Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc. Bookbinder will figure out the rest. (Although, it wouldn't hurt to generate a table of contents...just to be safe.)|||
