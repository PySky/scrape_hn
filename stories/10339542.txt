Since September 21, I record every day when I'm (and when I'm not) seated at my desk. I'm going to conduct this, somewhat weird, experiment during seven or eight weeks. I would like to known how many times a day do I sit down at my desk, and also to see if there is some recurring patterns. I record those data with an arduino linked to a Force Sensing Resistor. The code for the arduino (along with some photos) is available on Github.

This blog post is a debriefing of the first week of data recording.

The pressure is recorded with a scale varying from 0 to 1023. Zero being the absence of pressure and 1023 being the maximum pressure that the device can measure up. I take a measure every 30 seconds.

On the preceding plot, we can see the raw data for the week. They represent the whole scale of values. Depending how I'm sitting the device record different values. The blue points at bottom clearly indicate when I am not seated. After a few trials and errors, I found that 20 is a good threshold to separate raw data in two categories: seated and not seated.

Here is the result for the first week:

One can visualize the processed data in an interesting way, for example the Monday ; maroon areas represent when I am seated at my desk (the duration):

One can leverage this type of visualization to look at the whole week. It could be a mean to identify patterns. But this week was special for me (I worked also during the weekend, I normally never do this) so I'm going to wait for more data before to conclude anything.

I will surely write a following, more technical, post to show the R code to process the data and for the plots.

If you have a similar project (in your head or in the real world) I would like to hear about it, so leave your comment.|||
