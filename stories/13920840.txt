This add-on is for users who want to install Chrome extensions into Firefox. As Mozilla completes the WebExtensions API more and more Chrome extensions will work in Firefox.No Google account is needed for this to work. If you do want to install the addon permanently, you will need an account on this website ( addons.mozilla.org ) - this will allow the addon to be "signed".By default "Chrome Store Foxified" addon will try to sign addons and install them. This is because the only way to install an addon permanently into Firefox, is by *signing it*.Unsigned addons can however be installed current session only. This is known as "Temporary Addon Install". Temporary addons are automatically uninstalled when Firefox closes. An addon that is *not signed* can only be installed as a temporary addon.for Methodfor CRX/ZIP Conversionfor Developmentfor Testing, Idea and MotivationContinue localization, please help by joining at BabelZilla - http://beta.babelzilla.org/projects/p/chrome-store-foxified/|||
