In this talk we'll dive into Ruby and Python internals and take a close look at an ugly topic: garbage collection. How do these languages allocate memory for new objects? How do they identify unused objects? How do they reclaim memory from garbage objects, allowing it to be used again?



You can learn a lot about someone from their garbage. Using a series of diagrams, we'll visually compare and contrast the complex algorithms these languages use. What computer science research is behind each garbage collector? We'll learn a lot about Python and Ruby from their garbage collectors. We'll also look at the GC changes planned for the upcoming Ruby 2.1 release.|||
