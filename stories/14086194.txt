Pedis is the NoSQL data store using the SEASTAR framework, compatible with REDIS. The name of Pedis is an acronym of Parallel redis, which with high throughput and low latency.

Redis is very popular data structures server. For more infomation, see here: http://redis.io/ Seastar is an advanced, open-source C++ framework for high-performance server applications on modern hardware. For more infomation, see here: http://www.seastar-project.org/

Now, the redis commands were supported by Pedis as follow:

In addition to required packages by Seastar, the following packages are required by Pedis.

Installing GCC 4.9 for gnu++1y. Unlike the Fedora case above, this will not harm the existing installation of GCC 4.8, and will install an additional set of compilers, and additional commands named gcc-4.9, g++-4.9, etc., that need to be used explicitly, while the "gcc", "g++", etc., commands continue to point to the 4.8 versions.

To compile Seastar explicitly using gcc 4.9, use:

The following describe the details of the Pedis benchmark making it reproducible. The result data was generated by memtier_benchmark(https://github.com/RedisLabs/memtier_benchmark).

Pedis's latency was less then 0.5ms for 99% of all requests.|||
