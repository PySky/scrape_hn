This has helped enormously. I would like it to help more, but the whole "I paid my rent every month" thing isI am literally making ends meet – I mean, insofar as they do, which isn't always – by the grace of all you patrons who are funding me.My landlord has been super understanding about it; he apparently has reconciled himself to the fact that Patreon pays out on the fifth of the month, and I'm always going to be a week late. But it's going to be there.You may recall that part of my impetus in doing this was to avoid having to increase my clinic caseload, because then I wouldn't be able to grow my practice. My practice is growing! I still have tons that I need to do to promote it, but slowly (very slowly) but surely it is growing.Youse-all's support has saved my bacon repeatedly over the past year:• When the clinic I worked for at the time was firing people left and right, and I didn't dare increase my caseload because I didn't know if I'd be there much longer.• When Boston got socked by two months of blizzards, which kept the patients away in droves, and gored a hole in my income.• When the clinic I worked for did something breathtaking that caused about half my patients to have to leave the clinic – taking half my income with them.• When I was in this lean transition time with bringing on a second clinic.• And now, while this second clinic does something to gut my caseload.Also, I think youse-all were, if I understand correctly, instrumental in my qualifying for Fuel Assistance last winter, and will be again: apparently if you can't show you have sufficient income to pay your rent, they won't help you heat your apartment.I'm still living hand-to-mouth, and I'm getting additional financial help to make ends meet. I'd love to be able to breathe a bit easier, and for my margins to be less razor sharp. If any big emergency expenses come up, I'll be in big trouble.ETA: Also, insofar as one of my goals was to find out what I would and could write if only writing weren't pitted against my survival, this has also been a raging success that way.|||
