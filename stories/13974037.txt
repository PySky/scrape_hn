Google is working on Android Studio support atop Chrome OS. With this official Android integrated development environment on Chrome OS, could it make Chromebooks/Chromeboxes a great platform for Android development? This bug report from two days ago makes it public that Google is working on Android Studio support for Chrome OS. Having this Android IDE on Chrome OS makes it possible to both test and run Android apps, something not available for native testing when developing Android apps on Linux, macOS, or Windows. The Android Studio support is delivered using XWayland.It will be interesting to see in the weeks/months ahead what comes of this Android Studio support on Chrome OS and if Google ends up using it as a selling point for Chrome devices. Perhaps we'll learn more at the upcoming Google I/O conference.|||
