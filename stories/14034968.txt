In accordance with our security release policy, the Django team is issuing Django 1.10.7, Django 1.9.13 and 1.8.18. These release addresses two security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master and stable/1.11.x branches are also updated. The Django 1.11 release is forthcoming shortly in a separate blog post.

CVE-2017-7233: Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied numeric redirect URLs Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. and i18n) to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security check for these redirects (namely ) considered some numeric URLs (e.g. ) "safe" when they shouldn't be. Also, if a developer relies on to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.

A maliciously crafted URL to a Django site using the view could redirect to any other domain. The view no longer does any redirects as they don't provide any known, useful functionality. Note, however, that this view has always carried a warning that it is not hardened for production use and should be used only as a development aid. Thanks Phithon from Chaitin Tech (@ChaitinTech) for reporting this issue.

Per our supported versions policy, Django 1.7 and older are no longer receiving security updates. Also, Django 1.9.x has reached end-of-life -- this is the final release of that series.

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via private email to , and not via Django's Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see our security policies for further information.|||
