I am very concerned by the draft Investigatory Powers Technical Capability Regulation.

This proposal would compromise my personal security, and the safety of all residents of the United Kingdom.

I ask that you drop the demand that tech companies remove electronic protections, otherwise known as encryption.

The recent ransomware attack on the NHS shows exactly why companies need to be able to develop secure software without any backdoors that can be exploited by malicious actors.

We all deserve to be kept safe by strong encryption. Do not weaken everyoneâ€™s security by creating backdoors that hackers and malicious actors can exploit. Encryption is necessary for our personal privacy, for the security of our banking and online communications, and to protect journalists, lawyers, and the integrity of our national infrastructure. Strong encryption means unbreakable encryption.

I ask instead that the UK takes steps to set strong international standards on privacy. This legislation deserves a full and open public debate, embracing accountability for our security agencies.
