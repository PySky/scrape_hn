I’m pleased to announce the initial release of my Firebird drivers projects for Node.js.

The work is split in three projects, as described below.

This is the more interesting project for now. It allows to use Firebird (via Firebird v3+ client library) with a good high-level API.

More examples can be found here.

This project currently has only TypeScript interfaces for a Firebird client. In the future it may have common code for any Firebird client, like connection pools and utility functions.

implements the interfaces from this project. In the future, we may have another socket-based project also implementing these interfaces, so all drivers will be type-compatible.

This project converts Firebird cloop interfaces to TypeScript and NAN bindings to access the native fbclient code. It’s a dependency project for .

It’s currently not complete and you should use it directly only if you know what are you doing.

All the projects are currently in ALPHA version, so changes are expected without caring about semver breaks.|||
