Here's the kind of math astronaut Mark Watney would do to make it work: The landing will burn up around five to seven tons of propellant. When it comes time to take off from the Martian surface, the MAV will need 33 tons of propellant to break free of the red planet’s gravity, push through its atmosphere, and safely ferry the astronauts and their scientific cargo into orbit, where they can rendezvous and dock with their Earth Return Vehicle.

Drilling for water, however, would add an unwelcome element of uncertainty to an already difficult mission. Excavating and processing is a lot more complex than simply taking atmosphere from Mars. “The other problem with underground water propellant production is that it drives you to land where you're pretty sure there's water,” says Rucker. If you need to dig and “you land somewhere where it turns out you're on top of bedrock, then all bets are off,” she says.

Add it all up, and that means the MAV must remain operational and ready for takeoff for as many as four years after its initial landing on Mars. “It's been sitting in the Mars environment,” says Rucker. “It's sitting in dust. There's intense UV radiation. How does your patio furniture look after it's been sitting outside for that long? That's on Earth, where it gets considerably more protection than there.”|||

We know how to get to Mars. We know how to land on Mars. Now comes the hard part: figuring out how to leave.
