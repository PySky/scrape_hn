Network analyzers are instruments that assist generation and analysis on multiple channels. These are usually costlier than spectrum analyzers and vector instruments and are typically used to measure scattering parameters (also known as S-parameters) and other characteristics of RF waves and high-frequency radiation. The primary use of network analyzers is to determine the S-parameters of many sets of passive components like cables, filters, switches, and much more. Also, network analyzers can be enabled on active devices like transistors and amplifiers using S-parameters, until they operate in their linear mode of operation.
