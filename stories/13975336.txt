DNS-OARC is pleased to announce beta availability of a new tool for the

real-time replay of captured DNS traffic into a test environment,

“drool”. This work has been generously funded by the Comcast Innovation

Fund’s grant programme, for public open-source release.

drool can replay DNS traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send

it to a specified server, with the option to manipulate the timing

between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set number

of iterations. This tool is planned to produce a minimum of 200,000 UDP

packets per second and 10,000 TCP sessions per second on common hardware.|||
