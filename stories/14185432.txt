Russian army is given a special task of protecting the religious object “Ark of Gabriel” while it is being transported to Antarctica.

The “Ark of Gabriel” is said to have such “military-religious” importance, that President Putin ordered a large number of naval warships to guide its journey from Saudi Arabia to Antartica.

To what spurred this astonishing mission, this report explains, was the contacting on 25 September of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow by representatives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, regarding a mysterious ancient “device/weapon” discovered under the Masjid al-Haram Mosque (Grand Mosque) during what has turned into a very controversial construction project begun in 2014.

Gravely raising the concerns of the Grand Mosque emissaries, this report continues, was when this mysterious “device/weapon” was discovered on 12 September by a 15-man tunnel digging crew—and who in their attempting to remove it were instantly killed by a massive “plasma emission” so powerful it ejected from the ground toppling a construction crane killing, at least, another 107 people.

Catastrophically worse, this report notes, was that barely a fortnight after the first attempt to remove this mysterious “device/weapon” was made on 12 September, another attempt was made on 24 September which killed over 4,000 due to another massive “plasma emission” which put tens-of-thousands in panic—but which Saudi officials then blamed on a stampede.

After the catastrophic death toll involved with the Saudi’s second attempt to remove this mysterious “device/weapon”, this report says, His Holiness Patriarch Kirill was then contacted by the Grand Mosque emissaries in regards to one of the oldest Islamic manuscripts possessed by the Russian Orthodox Church that was saved from the Roman Catholic Crusaders in 1204 when they sacked the Church of Holy Wisdom (now known as Hagia Sophia) in Constantinople (present day Istanbul, Turkey) titled “Gabriel’s Instructions To Muhammad”.

Important to note, this report explains, and virtually unknown in the West, were that the Roman Catholic Crusades (and like they mirror today) were not only against the peoples of Islamic faith, but also against those having Russian Orthodox faith too—and why, during these crusades, the Russian Orthodox Church not only protected their own religious libraries from being destroyed, but also those belonging to Muslims.

As to the contents of this ancient Islamic manuscript, “Gabriel’s Instructions To Muhammad”, this report briefly notes, it centers around a group of instructions given to Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel in a cave called Hira, located on the mountain called Jabal an-Nour, near Mecca, wherein this heavenly being entrusted into Muhammad’s care a “box/ark” of “immense power” he was forbidden to use as it belonged to God only and was, instead, to be buried in a shrine at the “place of worship the Angels used before the creation of man” until its future uncovering in the days of Yawm al-Qīyāmah, or Qiyâmah, which means literally “Day of the Resurrection”.

As to what this mysterious “weapon/device” actually is we are not allowed to report on due to the strictures we have to abide by in being allowed to publish even the merest glimpses of what happens behind Kremlin walls we are currently permitted to do .
