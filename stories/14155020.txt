I have only one need and didn't want to maintain too much code, and didn't want to

 depend on another Twitter bot I can't customize. So I did my own in 1 hour and I was

 pretty happy with so I release it for free :)

Only 1: configure a webhook in GitHub for your repository. Everytime you'll publish a new release a Tweet

 will be sent by the account of your choice: amazing, right?

More you can customize the tweet to be sent thanks to the MicroEngine embed with this app'

In fact you don't have to write code, you only need to create an app on Twitter to get

 credentials needed by TweetHub (https://apps.twitter.com/).

Then you create a file from the distributed one and you complete it.

Well, you can access every getter from Release entity in your tweet :) This will help you to provide the url of changelog for instance!

No thanks, I don't have too much time to spend on my "baby" projects. If you like and use it, you can "star" the project,

 this is free and can make me smile, so what are you waiting for?|||

tweethub - A damn simple github bot to tweet about new releases :octocat:
