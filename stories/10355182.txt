Stingray is an IDAPython plugin for finding function strings. The search is from the current position onwards in the current function. It can do it recursively also with configurable search depth. The results order is the natural order of strings in the BFS search graph.

For each found string it displays the xref address, the string address, the string type and the of course the string itself.

My Stingray was configured to recursive search we depth of 3. I put the cursor on main function and hit Shift+S. We get the following Stingray output:

load your favourite binary with IDA. To find strings in the current function from your position onwards hit Shift+s.

Stingray can also be found in Edit/Plguins/Stingray menu.

Stingray finds strings recursively ! you can configure the search depth in the Stingray Config menu.

You can configure Stingray anytime from Options\Stingray Config menu.

You can configure the search depth. For non-recursive search mode choose 0 depth.

By default, Stingray is in non-recursive mode.|||
