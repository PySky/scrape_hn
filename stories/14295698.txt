I have 6 years experience in Digital Marketing and a passion for the App Store. I worked as a Community Manager at Geckoboard, followed by a great stint at Hopster TV as a Marketing Exec. and currently focussing on Web Content & Marketing at a large toy distributor in the UK.

I love to work on a plethora of side projects in my free time such as the apps below and a recently launched SaaS app with my brother, Teleprompter Cloud..

I've always wanted to write more, I've set myself a target of one post a week. Here are some of my recent articles. Clicking any of the posts below will take you to Medium.|||
