A bill focused on electric skateboards was signed by Governor Jerry Brown on Sunday that will make it legal beginning in January to ride a skateboard in places where it is legal to ride bicycles, according to the Wall Street Journal. The legislation reverses an outdated 1977 ban that restricted more primitive gas-powered boards, pioneered by Motoboard. The bill extends to other motorized contraptions that contribute zero emissions.

California is the birthplace of skate culture depicted in the 2001 documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys, which led to the growth of the multimillion-dollar skateboard industry. The legislation is a landmark decision that opens doors to electric skateboard manufacturers like Boosted and ZBoard, which are both California-based companies. Prices for a ZBoard start at $600, but as the electric skateboard goes mainstream, it's possible that the costs will drop — riding electric skateboards on the state's public streets is technically illegal. The bill still allows local community official to ban electric skateboards at their discretion.
