People often want to learn a language but can't find time. WaitChatter is based on the idea of wait-learning. It makes use of time you spend waiting for your IM buddy to respond to teach you a foreign language. 





WaitChatter currently teaches basic vocabulary in Spanish and French, and assumes your native language is English, but we hope to support other languages in the future.

For your privacy, this public version of WaitChatter does not pull any vocabulary words from your chat conversations, and does not log any content from your chats. It does track how many times you answer the learning exercises and what vocabulary words you have answered correctly so that it can select the best word to quiz you on next.

Because your vocabulary is stored only in your browser, clearing "Hosted app data" in Chrome will also clear your vocabulary progress.
