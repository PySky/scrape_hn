The US Marshals Service is selling another chunk of Silk Road bitcoins. The 44,341 BTC, to be sold in blocks of 2,000 bitcoin, will go on sale from 12:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC on November 5, 2015.

These are the final bitcoins taken from Ross Ulbricht, alleged mastermind of the Silk Road.

The coins are worth about $10.6 million in total. The US Marshals wrote:

￼”The registration period starts 19th October and runs until noon 2nd November, at which time potential bidders must have completed all registration requirements. Registration documents that were submitted for the Marshals’ previous bitcoin auctions are not valid for this auction; interested bidders must submit new registration documents to be considered for this auction.”
