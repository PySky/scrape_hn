It’s easy to dismiss emojis – consisting of silly faces and undefined symbols – as a language only for teenagers.

But remember, more than one thousand written symbols date back to 3,000 BCE hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt, and some of them are still used today. They’re not just a fad – here today, gone tomorrow. And as they say, a picture’s worth a thousand words.

Emojis transcend borders, languages and technology. And the emoji language is integrated into your mobile phone, listed between Dutch and Estonian.

Plus, with less emojis than three-character domain names (2,389 emojis versus 17,576 LLL.com) there’s definitely a supply issue.

Will emojis be the next domain name breakout trend that nobody expected?

An emoji is a small image used in digital communications – primarily text messages and social media posts.

The word emoji comes from the Japanese words: e (絵, “picture” – pronounced “eh”) and moji (文字, “character”). You might hear people refer to emojis as pictograms or pictographs, which is what they used to be called and is technically a better translation for emoji in Japanese.

Japanese mobile phones were the first to allow emojis – each using their own proprietary characters and standards. The first set of 176 emojis was released in 1999 and drawn on a 12 x 12 pixel grid for the then-simple, text-only phone displays by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo’s i-mode mobile internet platform.

Pictographs (aka pictograms or pictures of things) like a white sun with black rays ☼, were some of the earliest written elements found thousands of years ago. We then evolved to logograms, which are symbols for words like $ for money. And then ideograms, which include ideas like a red cross for hospital.

Worldwide adoption of emojis continued to grow over the years, but popularity grew exponentially starting in 2007 when Apple included the emoji keyboard in their iPhone, which was quickly followed by Android- and Microsoft-powered phones.

When emojis grew in popularity, some internet pioneer asked the question:

Can I make this emoji character into a domain name? 🍿

He then registered the first emoji domain and renewed it for years – even though nobody else saw value in it (hello, Rick Schwartz buying domains like TopSecret.com and Property.com in the mid-1990s when everyone else thought .com domain names were worthless).

And so the first emoji domain name was registered.

Actually, three were registered on the first day:

All three were registered April 19, 2001. (I’ll tell you how I figured this out below.)

But you’re probably wondering why there’s both an image AND some crazy domain name starting with “xn--” listed above.

Each emoji character is represented by some universal sequence of characters called Unicode, which is an international programming standard that allows one operating system to recognize text from another operating system.

Prior to 2010, only ASCII characters could be used when registering a domain name. Because of this, two algorithms called ToASCII and ToUnicode were developed to translate Unicode into ASCII, and vice versa. Then an encoding process called Punycode creates the domain name. 😴 Yes, this is technically confusing, and yes, that’s a strange name.

In Punycode, only letters, digits and hyphens are allowed, and then the four characters “xn--” are prepended.

Second-level domains starting with “xn--” are also referred to as Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) because they allow non-ASCII based languages that require diacritics (e.g., Spanish, French) and or use non-Latin scripts (e.g., Kanji and Arabic) to render properly in ASCII.

When you type 🦄.ws into your web browser, the browser translates the emoji portion of the domain name into its IDN (in this case xn--3s9h.ws), looks up the domain name system information, and then loads the associated website.

When doing a WHOIS lookup on 🦄.ws, you will need to determine the IDN first (using punycoder.com), and then perform your search: https://whois.domaintools.com/xn--3s9h.ws

The Unicode Consortium, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, is entrusted to define emoji characters and to encode symbols into Unicode. Founded in 1991, the Unicode Consortium consists of a loose network of contributing members – much like what ICANN is for domain names.

In the 2000s, Google realized the importance of emojis and worked to translate emoji characters to Unicode. In 2007, Google and Apple filed a joint proposal for emoji standards with the Unicode Consortium, which was accepted, and cross-platform standards for emojis were born.

In 2010, ICANN (the governing body for domain names) put in place rules called “IDN2008” disallowing about eight thousand characters – including emojis – in general top-level domains (think .com, .net and .org) due to “homograph” (visually confusable characters) attacks. 😈

If you had the vision to register an emoji domain name prior to this date, then you’re golden. Today, you can only register emojis in country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) that allow them, like .ws (Western Samoa) and a few others.

The current set of Unicode Consortium-approved emoji characters (version 4.0 as of this publishing) includes more than 2,389 characters.

But as with anything good, more is better. Right?

People asked for a face vomiting . And an avocado 🥑. And people of color 👩🏿‍🎨. (You too can submit a proposal for an emoji, and here are the current emoji prospects for the next release.)

So the Unicode Consortium went to work. They had to invent the emojis, design them, gather input, approve them, encode them and publish them.

New emojis should then appear on mobile phones and web browsers as soon as companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft add them to their operating systems.

In the summer of 2016, the Unicode Consortium launched more than 250 new emojis, ranging from rolling on the floor with laughter 🤣 to the long awaited Mrs. Claus 🤶.

And in fall of the same year, the Unicode Consortium added diversity to emojis, providing an option to choose the skin tone of emojis with faces and hands based on the FitzPatrick scale, a recognized standard for dermatology.

New emoji standards (or versions) are launched periodically to align with worldwide use and trends. For example, why would anyone in 2001 have wanted a smiling pile of poop emoji? Today, it’s a critical way to communicate a feeling or outcome. 💩

The Emoji 5.0 standard is being planned and no launch date has been announced yet. Even though the emoji characters have been defined, they may not be supported by browsers or mobile phones yet.

Here is the full list of currently approved emojis.

Here is the full list including pending emojis. New characters are shown as a group with “…” before and after.

And here’s a description of what all the table headers mean.

As mentioned earlier, pictographs are simplified symbols, such as WHITE SUN WITH RAYS ☼ U+263C, and even though they can be translated into a domain name such as xn--94h.net, it is not an emoji domain name because is it not part of the latest emoji standard.

There is overlap between the Unicode Emoji Standard and the Unicode Standard, which includes more than emojis.

On Wikipedia, there is a web page that describes the oldest existing domain names:

To some, owning one of these domain names is like owning a piece of history, a rare painting, or the numbers-matching collectible car. There is prestige and credibility associated with it.

So I thought it would be interesting to determine when the first emoji domain name was registered, what it was and who registered it. 🕵

My process to determine the oldest emoji was to:

The key to this exercise will be in seeing which pictographs registered in the early 2000s (because, remember, there weren’t any emojis back then) in the .com TLD are emojis today.

Oh, I already told you above. 😜

Three pictograph domain names were registered on April 19, 2001, that later became full-fledged emoji domain names: the hot springs ♨️ in both .com and .net and the peace symbol ☮ in .com.

According to DomainIQ, xn--j6h.com and xn--j6h.net are the oldest with a surprisingly identical 2001-04-19T04:00:00Z registration date, while xn--v4h.com is a close runner-up with its 2001-04-19T18:13:06.0Z registration date. (Evidently, peace comes 12 hours, 13 minutes and 6 seconds after getting into a hot spring.)

Even though all emoji are created equal, not all emoji have the same popularity.

Emojitracker.com shows the realtime emoji use on Twitter. The top two emojis include laughing so hard I’m crying 😂 and red heart ❤️.

See, laughter and love conquer all!

In September 2010 an emoji aficionado named Fred Benenson self-published the first entirely emoji translated classic novel Moby Dick, entitling it – of course – Emoji Dick.

In early 2015, a fun billboard campaign from Coca-Cola Puerto Rico targeted younger consumers who readily use emojis on mobile phones by promoting the smiling face emoji as a domain name.

The .ws? Although Western Samoa would beg to differ, Coke said it was meant to convey “we smile.”

Plenty of other well-known companies own and are using emoji domains because they give your voice a snappy attitude:

Oxford Dictionaries named 😂 (Face With Tears of Joy aka Laughing So Hard I’m Crying) its 2015 Word of the Year.

The first international emoji conference, Emojicon, was held in San Francisco, California on November 4, 2016. Dubbed as a three-day “celebration of all things emoji” it was sponsored by heavyweights GE, Adobe and Baidu among others.

If conferences aren’t your thing but you prefer to wear your emojis — it’s been said that “emojis are the new black.”

Even an emoji movie is planned! “The Emoji Movie,” an animated adventure comedy, is due out in the summer of 2017 starring Sir Patrick Stewart of “Star Trek” and “X-Men” fame. Yes, he plays the voice of poop. 💩

While all single character emoji domain names have already been registered (although, sometimes, people let their domains expire), you can still register multiple-character emoji domain names.

Although many top-level domain names used to allow emoji domain names, today .ws is one of the few country code registries that support emoji. (Freenom.com offers .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, and .gq top-level domains.) And .ws is considered the “.com” of the ccTLDs that support emoji domain names.

If you want to buy 10 thumbs up in the .ws top-level domain, let’s say, here’s what you do:

Or, you could simply visit ❤❤❤.ws to look up availability of .ws domains and immediately register it through their association with GoDaddy.

At the time of publication, I found 10 thumbs up .ws available for $4.99 at GoDaddy, but you can use any registrar that sells .ws domain names.

I also found the front-facing car 🚘 available in .ga, .cf and .gq for free at Freenom:



Of course, just like with any other domain name, if it’s already registered you can do a WHOIS lookup, contact the registrant, and offer to buy their domain name.

And, for the TLDs that do accept emojis, you can mix letters and emoji characters. i❤.ws, for example, is xn--i-7iq.ws, and it resolves.

Just like with other domain names, it depends on the length, popularity, age and other valuation metrics. And, of course, how badly you want it. 🤑

I recently contacted a few single character emoji domains in the .ws top-level domain – really popular emojis – and I either didn’t get any response back to my purchase inquiry, or in one case I was told that it would need to be around $18,000 (but even then he wasn’t sure he wanted to sell it).

Will emoji continue in their meteoric rise as a language, back from the dead?

Is everything old, new again?

Time will tell. Until then, ☮.

Thanks to Matan Israeli for igniting my interest in emoji domain names at NamesCon 2017 and agreeing to sell me a few like 🦄.ws, 🤙.ws, .ws and .ws. Thanks to Luc Lezon at Intelium for support gathering data so I could perform my historical analysis. Thanks to Matan and Jon Roig for sharing their insights on DomainSherpa.com/emoji-domain-names. And thanks to Shane Cultra for peer reviewing this paper. Finally, I couldn’t have done this without the love and support (and copyediting expertise) of my beautiful wife, Erin.|||
