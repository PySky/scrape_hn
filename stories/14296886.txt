Quantum Computing and Devices (QCD) Labs led by Mikko Möttönen has demonstrated a novel type of a refrigerator which directly cools down the functional degrees of freedom of quantum electric devices. This cooler is referred to as the quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR). In their work just published in Nature Communications, the team experimentally demonstrates cooling of a linear superconducting resonator. Theoretically, the refrigeration principle works also for superconducting qubits which are typically slightly non-linear resonators. These kind of qubits are currently the most promising building blocks of the future large-scale quantum computer. Thus the QCR may be useful in the initialization of the quantum memory and other emerging quantum technological devices.
