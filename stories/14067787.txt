Don't miss the Houston Art Car Parade 1 Hour Special, April 22 on ABC13 at 4PM.

The Art Car Parade is the highlight of a three-day celebration of the drive to create: Art Car Weekend. But it all began with a donated 1967 Ford station wagon and $800 worth of paint and plastic fruit. And now, 30 years later, it attracts 250+ vehicles (and other entries) from 23 states, Canada, and Mexico!|||
