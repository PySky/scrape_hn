Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity. Consequently, functions provided by Stéganô only hide messages, without encryption. Steganography is often used with cryptography.

You will be able to use Stéganô in your Python programs or as a command line tool.

If you want to use Stéganô in your Python program you just have to import the appropriate steganography technique. For example:

The message will be scattered in the picture, following a set described by the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Other sets are available. You can also use your own generators.

This will make a steganalysis more complicated.|||

Stegano - Stéganô is a pure Python steganography module. Different methods of steganography and steganalysis are provided.
