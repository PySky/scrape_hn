Rhodes pocketed at least $22.7 million from the sale of his stock and options in the leveraged buyout of Rackspace by New York private equity firm Apollo Global Management, according to a Nov. 3 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  “We’re going to keep driving to expand Rackspace’s leadership of the fast-growing market for managed cloud services,” Cotten wrote in a blog post Wednesday.  In his blog post, Rhodes said Rackspace — which no longer publicly discloses its financial results — recently reported strong fourth-quarter results to its bond and debt holders.  [...] Rackspace was facing intense and increasing competition from the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Inc. But after a four-month review that included hiring investment banking firm Morgan Stanley to assist the company to size up its “strategic” options, Rackspace chose to remain as independent.  When we were a private company, we could make decisions with a longer time horizon than potentially we can as a public company.  “And we knew the right things to do for the long-term viability of the company, and that’s what we feel excited about doing as a private company,” he added.
