Telkom South Africa's subsidiary, BCX, has said that it will be investing $4,4 million (R60 million) into WeThinkCode_ to increase the number of entry-level coders in South Africa and help the organization expand.

WeThinkCode_ is a South African coding school that teaches students software programming for no tuition and places them on projects to gain work experience. They also say that they work closely with ICT industry leaders in South Africa to ensure students learn what is relevant and current before placing them on projects to gain 8-months work-experience.

“As part of this agreement, BCX and other Telkom Group companies will host 40 interns from WeThinkCode’s innovative educational programme every year for the next three years,” said BCX in a statement.

“Coding skills are a vital component of the new digital economy, and WeThinkCode’s innovative programme is a great way to invest in the future digital minds of South Africa.” said Sipho Maseko, Telkom South Africa Group CEO.|||
