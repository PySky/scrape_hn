Some webpages are Cool and some are Uncool due to biasness, factuality, correctness, importance, timeliness, or based on one's emotion.

Step 1. Start by typing a link or text in the search box (at top middle or below on a phone) to tag a page or an image, as Cool or Uncool.

Step 2. Click on the Cool (or up) or UnCool (or down) button & comment about the particular link in the following page to backup your vote.

Step 3. Help even more: Share, comment, discuss about the page, or the media.|||
