Last September, we launched the Early Access Program of GitHub Integrations, a new option for extending GitHub. We've recently added some new features and moved Integrations into pre-release so you can begin using it within your production workflows. Here's a summary of the latest features. You can learn more about what's changed from our Developer Blog.

Users can now log in with your Integration using the OAuth protocol, allowing you to identify users and display data to them from the relevant installations. Additionally, an Integration can now make authorized API requests on behalf of a user; for example, to deploy code or create an issue. Learn more about authenticating as a user via an Integration.

When you create an Integration, you have to specify which permissions it needs; for example, the ability to read issues or create deployments. Now you can update the requested permissions via Settings > Developer settings > Integrations, whenever the needs of your Integration change. Users will be prompted to accept these changes and enable the new permissions on their installation.

Finally, you now have the option to configure a Setup URL to which you can redirect users after they install your integration if any additional setup is required on your end.

More information on getting started can be found on our Developer Blog and in our documentation. We'd also love to hear what you think. Talk to us in the new Platform forum.|||
