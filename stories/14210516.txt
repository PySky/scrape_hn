For all those who used docker-compose and similar tools, sometimes having environment files is crucial to keep file organized and to make it easier to use and understand. When you move from docker-compose to Kubernetes you will probably search for this kind of feature. Prior to Kubernetes version 1.6, it was not possible to add environment file as a and just use it for container specs when needed. It is really useful when you have a lot of properties for your app and especially when you want to use it for multiple apps. So, instead of specifying each environment variable individually we can reference the whole .

As an example I will use Hadoop properties from a project I worked on recently. I had a lot containers and they all shared the same properties. Here is ConfigMap:

Then we need to create it like any other Kubernetes resource from yaml file:

When environment file is defined we could just reference it for any container in the same namespace. Here as an example I will use namenode deployment:

Also, if you have some special environment variables you want to use just for this particular container, you could add them together with ConfigMap:
