In a Nutshell: I visited North Korea in late 2014 for 16 days, just prior to the absolute lockdown caused by Ebola.

It was an eye-opening experience, to say the least. Upon exiting the country, my cameras were searched for over 2 hours in Sinuiju. Many photos were deleted. However, I had backups.Â Here are 100 photos (part 1) taken during my time in North Korea, enjoy.|||
