My name is Mladen Bošnjak, I’m an indie game developer and multimedia grad student. This is the story of how my fellow developer Ron “Maxwolf” McDowell stole my Steam game SickBrick from me and is now earning money from it even though I made the majority of the game.

I conceived of SickBrick in 2008 while playing around with the NeoAxis engine. Here is the first video of SickBrick I posted (June 2009):

And here is the release trailer, also posted by me:

At the start of 2011 I presented a few screenshots of the game on the NeoAxis forums.

Another developer working in NeoAxis that goes by the name of „Maxwolf“ (real name Ron McDowell) took notice of it and asked me to help him with his game Incognito. Note that Maxwolf is a mod on those forums and will probably delete my topics there. He said he had already sold more than 1000 copies and would pay me from further sales. I made all the RTS buildings, tanks, some enemies, terrain textures and so on. Maxwolf never paid me anything.

Since I never got paid I asked Maxwolf to help me finish my game SickBrick. I had most of the game done: all the levels, weapons, enemies, text, music… Maxwolf worked on the enemy navigation system, got the HUD, the boss fights and some other things working. He also had a licensed version of the NeoAxis engine which helped offset the cost for me, I didn’t have to buy one. Later on I got a license for the engine myself. We released the game on Desura with his then company Magrathean Technologies taking 10% off of all sales. Here’s the signed agreement between me and his company:

It’s signed by his friend Kyle Polulak who goes by the name of „Fox Diller“ online.|||
