About the book:  This unique edition of This Side of Paradise from Dead Dodo Vintage includes the full original text as well as exclusive features not available in other editions. This Side of Paradise is the debut novel of F. Scott Fitzgerald. This Side of Paradise, F. Scott Fitzgerald's romantic and witty first novel, was written when the author was only twenty-three years old. Published in 1920, and taking its title from a line of the Rupert Brooke poem Tiare Tahiti, the book examines the lives and morality of post-World War I youth. Its protagonist, Amory Blaine, is an attractive Princeton University student who dabbles in literature. The novel explores the theme of love warped by greed and status-seeking. This book is written in three parts. • "Book One: The Romantic Egotist"- the novel centres on Amory Blaine, a young Midwesterner who, convinced that he has an exceptionally promising future, attends boarding school and later Princeton University. While at Princeton he re-encounters Isabelle Borgé, and starts a romantic relationship with her, but after a few days they breakup. • "Interlude"- Following their break-up, Amory is shipped overseas, to serve in the army in World War I. • "Book Two: The Education of a Personage"- The book ends with Amory's iconic lament, "I know myself, but that is all." Its success, however, helped the now-famous Fitzgerald earn much higher rates for his short stories.|||
