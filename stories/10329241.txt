Elm is a functional programming language for the web.

Elm lets you write programs in a simple functional language and it compiles to , and . This sounded like a cool way to learn about FRP (Functional Reactive Programming), so I decided to give it a try.

Because it’s a young language (the thesis which gave it birth was in 2012) it’s evolving fast, so dependencies and syntax are still changing.

We want to install the Elm-Platform which comes with all the tools to get started:

To install you will need Haskell and Cabal (the Haskell package manager). Currently you need and at least .

However installing them with on Ubuntu will install an older version which won’t work ( and ).

So the first thing is to get a more recent version of Cabal and ghc

The packages install into so in order to use them, the easiest way is to bring a particular GHC version into scope by placing the respective folder early into the environment variable. See also https://github.com/hvr/multi-ghc-travis for more information

and add it to your variable (or add it to your .bashrc):

You should now see:

or you can add it to .bashrc or .bash_profile as described here.

You can test if your installed version is right with:

you can compile it with which should create 3 files:
