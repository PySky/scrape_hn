A viewer that uses 24-Bit color capabilities and unicode character blocks to display images in the terminal.

Displays regular images, plays animated gifs or allows to scroll static images.

Very useful for if you want to have a quick visual check without starting a bulky image viewer ... and don't care about resolution.

timg some-image.jpg timg -g50x50 some-image.jpg timg .jpg timg some-animated.gif timg -t5 some-animated.gif timg -s some-image.jpg timg -s100 some-image.jpg timg -s -d1:0 some-image.jpg scroll with dx=1 and dy=0, so horizontally. timg -s -d-1:0 some-image.jpg timg -s -d0:2 some-image.jpg timg -s -d1:1 some-image.jpg Also, you could store the output and cat later to your terminal... timg -g80x40 some-image.jpg /tmp/imageout.txt cat /tmp/imageout.txt Of course, you can go really crazy by storing a cycle of an animation. Use xz for compression as it seems to deal with this kind of stuff really well: timg -g60x30 -C -c1 nyan.gif xz /tmp/nyan.term.xz ..now, replay that cycle in a loop. Latch on the frame marker with awk to delay xzcat /tmp/nyan.term.xz gawk

Note, this requires that your terminal can display 24 bit true color and is able to display the unicode character â–€ (U+2580, 'Upper Half Block'). If not, it doesn't show anything or it is garbage.

Tested terminals: >= 2.14.1, > 3.6.2 look good, recent xterms also seem to work (albeit with less color richness). Like gnome-terminal, libvte based terminals in general should work, such as Xfte or termite. Also QTerminal is confirmed working.

Linux console seems to be limited in colors and does not show the block character - if you know how to enable the unicode character or full color there, please let me know.

For Mac users, the iTerm2 >= 3.x should work, please confirm if you have this setup.|||
