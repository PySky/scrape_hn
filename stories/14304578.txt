A digital entrepreneur is one of the few that can make it a reality. Because of this – freedom – many people start the journey, few finish it. It’s not because it’s difficult – although it can be that too – it’s because they don’t understand everything involved.

It’s easy to tell someone to hustle.

It’s another thing entirely to do it.

A digital entrepreneur is able to make the sacrifices before, during, and after the journey in order to come out on top.

The infographic below will pull back the curtains a bit and make you ask a few of the harder questions. You’ll have a better idea of whether or not you’re ready to take the plunge.

It’ll also show you how low the barrier to entry truly is.

It’s a playful infographic, but the insights about being a digital entrepreneur are dead serious.

Don’t worry if you didn’t get the results you were looking for. Not everyone is ready. Not everyone takes teh same path. Your journey may be different and the things mentioned here don’t apply to you.

Instead, focus on how you can change your outcome and become the entrepreneur your business needs. That’s the only thing that matters to a true digital entrepreneur. Where you start isn’t as important as where you hope to be. What you’re willing to sacrifice and the energy you’re willing to put in count so much more than your starting poing.
