Re: EuroBSDCon 2015 OpenBSD Presentations Online (mod -5/25) 

 by Just Another OpenBSD User (95.42.51.185) on Sun Oct 18 12:03:51 2015 (GMT) Less OpenBSD representation in EuroBSDcon 2015 compared to last year's, there must be much more happening in the tree. Hope next year brings OpenBSD talks on all interesting new developments. I was watching live all the time.

 

 Poor (as in penniless) fellows would appreciate uninterrupted live streams (during talk setup, questions and hallways as well) with better video quality (readability) and lower bandwidth requirements (resolution). Obviously this is a University set up and not a conference centre, but a little more test preparation would not have hurt.

 

 A note of criticism, Youtube was glitchy to watch on good broadband (codec choice) compared to self managed streaming last year and some viewers reported blocked countries (waat?). Audio was missing and cut at the beginning of some talks, and all talks audio was badly clipping with distortion. Streams were not announced in advance as links and there was no test signal to prepare for reception, where the browsers failed to deliver anything. People who want pseudo-stereo have options in multiple ways to manage audio channels, so this is not a concern. Everything looked and worked out great from a online viewers distance though.

 

 Other conferences could simply try to stream live too, shame to organize an event and miss this opportunity to attract spectators and interest. EuroBSDcon was great to watch online as always no matter what technical issues there might have been, it was worth every second and the talks are priceless.
