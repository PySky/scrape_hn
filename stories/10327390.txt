I use Vim as my text editor and ctags for source code navigation.

I’ve found ctag’s default javascript tagging to be lacking so I’ve added the following to my ctags config file to handle some of the newer ES2015 syntax such as classes .

Note that the listing below contains comments which ctags config files don’t support. You can find the actual file on Github.

Some of these matchers are too eager but a lack of negative look behinds in the regex engine ctags uses makes that a pain to avoid. Instead I have a script which executes ctags and then filters obviously useless tags from the tag file afterwards.

I trigger the script from within Vim automatically using a plugin I wrote called tagman.vim.|||
