Excuse me if the title seemed a little spam-y to you. But it does describe exactly what happened.

At home, as well as in the office, I use two computers on a daily basis and both are running under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. They’re not the best of their breed, to say the least, but that can’t explain the state of horrible sluggishness they’re in.

I blamed Ubuntu, Unity, Chrome, the rise of Electron apps, Slack’s Electron app. Modern software is no home for my two little babies.

It all changed last week when I opened the System Monitor app on my desktop machine (dual-core Intel CPU, 4 Go of RAM). And as soon as I killed the Evolution processes, the computer became significantly faster, a lot more responsive and way less sluggish.

To be clear: these are the default Evolution clique, as I didn’t install the famous mail client.

Instead of being rebooted at least twice a day to (partly) get rid of the slowness it frequently contracted, my computer is now entering its second week of continuous labor. Fast and furious.

I also did the same trick on my netbook (Atom CPU, 2 Go of RAM) and it also greatly gained in smoothness. I never knew it would feel this awesome to just open the lid and start working right away. No cringy waiting is necessary.

So, if you don’t use Evolution or a piece of software that depend on it, just kill those damn processes.

But why not just uninstall Evolution once and for all? Because apparently that may cause some significant damage to Ubuntu. Go figure.|||
