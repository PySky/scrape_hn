Been there. Try going freelance for a while, if that's feasible. Helped me a lot, good for the ego. I quit a job where I was just boosting an agency's reputation when I could have been building my own. So I went freelance. Otherwise, what about teaching? Another way to get an ego boost: teaching the next generation to things the right way. Answering people's questions on StackOverflow also buffed my ego, and I got headhunted after I answered a lot of questions on JS.|||
