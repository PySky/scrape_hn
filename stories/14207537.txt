Seems that community is too stupid and irresponsible to decide even for the simplest things like a stupid logo, as there are many votes coming from random usernames like "dsfsdfsdf sdsdgdsfg".

So the logo will be just an empty circle, to remind all of you how stupid and irresponsible the community is.

PS: 1) please don't reply to my post because I will not read and respond as I have more important things to do 2) To all those who submitted a logo: I'm sorry for your precious time you lost, but seems that community is not ready yet.|||
