Superset is a data exploration platform designed to be visual, intuitive and interactive.

[this project used to be named Caravel, and Panoramix in the past]

Superset's main goal is to make it easy to slice, dice and visualize data. It empowers users to perform analytics at the speed of thought.

Superset was originally designed on top of Druid.io, but quickly broadened its scope to support other databases through the use of SQLAlchemy, a Python ORM that is compatible with most common databases.

From their website at http://druid.io

Druid is an open-source analytics data store designed for business intelligence (OLAP) queries on event data. Druid provides low latency (real-time) data ingestion, flexible data exploration, and fast data aggregation. Existing Druid deployments have scaled to trillions of events and petabytes of data. Druid is best used to power analytic dashboards and applications.
