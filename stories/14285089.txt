Maybe it’s just my filter bubble but I see signs of organisations realising they need to be better at experimenting & learning just about everywhere.

While this is a good step forward don’t forget to change everything in your company that prevents learning. Things like:

— Stop making huge investments in uncertain projects (no, uncertainty about if you manage to deliver on time is not what I’m talking about, it’s uncertainty about stakeholder value — huge investments should be in a portfolio of experiments if anything).

— Stop incentivising execution at the expense of exploring (you have a career path for managers but not for intrapreneurs).

— Stop letting the Highest Paid Persons Opinion (HIPPO) rule supreme (central command & control is the opposite of learning).

— Stop hiring people that believe they have all the answers (knowing is the opposite of learning).

— Stop shouting at your customers (talking & listening is how you learn).

I could go on like this for quite some time.

My point is: go on, take that “lean startup workshop”, start doing A/B test experiments, build that MVP.

But be humble about the journey you have in front of you. It’s a long one.|||
