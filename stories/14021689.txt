Heterozygous Tg2576 mice21 and WT littermates were used at ages ranging from 2 to 11 months old, as described in the text. Only male subjects were used. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU). Experimental approval was obtained from the Italian Health Ministry (protocol #1191/2015PR).

Animals used for L-DOPA experiments were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 mg kg−1 L-DOPA plus 12 mg kg−1 benserazide (both from Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in saline, or with 0.9% saline only (sham) once a day for three consecutive evenings and 1 h before experimental session (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Animals used for selegiline experiments were subcutaneously injected with 3 mg kg−1 selegiline (R-(−)-deprenyl hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in 0.9% saline (sel) or with 0.9% saline only (sham). For a detailed description of the timeline of selegiline treatment for different experiments see Supplementary Figs 4c and 5a,d,g. For all treatments, injection volume was 5 μl per animal weight in grams.

Mice were anaesthetized with Rompun (20 mg ml−1, 0.5 ml kg−1, i.p., Bayer) and Zoletil (100 mg ml−1, 0.5 ml kg−1, Virbac) and perfused transcardially with 50 ml saline followed by 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1 M, pH 7.4). The brains were postfixed in paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and then immersed in a 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C. The brains were cut into 30 μm-thick coronal sections using a freezing microtome.

The sections selected for immunohistochemistry (every second slice was processed for a total of 9 sections) were processed with a rabbit anti-TH antibody. The endogenous peroxidise was neutralized with a 0.3% H O solution in PB. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After three washes in PB, sections were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) followed by the avidin–biotin-peroxidase method (Vectastain, ABC kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) and using the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Finally, sections were counterstained with Nissl staining, dehydrated and coverslipped with Entellan (Sigma).

For TH/GFAP, TH/Iba1, TH/NeuroTrace staining and for TH/APPswe, NeuroTrace/APPswe deposition, slices were incubated overnight with primary antibodies in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies.

For DAT quantification, acute coronal brain slices (see below) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB and transferred to 30% sucrose in PB at 4 °C. Slices were incubated for 2 days with primary antibodies in PB containing 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies. DAT levels (F/A) and TH levels (F/A) were quantified with ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) as mean signal fluorescence intensity (F) on a defined area (A). Quantification was done on eight samples per mouse.

For the analysis of GFAP, Iba1 and DAT markers, images were taken as Z-stacks and these Z-stack images were then processed by maximum intensity projection. All samples were acquired with the same Z-stack thickness and the same laser settings. Data collection for densitometry was done by a researcher blind to the genotype of each animal.

The sections were counterstained with NeuroTrace 640/660 deep-red Fluorescent Nissl Stain (1:200, Invitrogen), mounted using an anti-fade medium (Fluoromount, Sigma-Aldrich) and examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM700, Zeiss). The specificity of the immunohistochemical labelling was confirmed by the omission of primary antibodies and the use of normal serum instead (negative controls).

All images were exported in tagged image file format (TIFF), contrast and brightness were adjusted and final plates were composed with Adobe Illustrator CS3.

Sections processed for immunohistochemistry were used for obtaining unbiased estimates of total number of TH+ and TH− neurons in the SNpc and VTA and TH+ neurons in the LC. The boundaries of these areas in the mouse brain were defined by TH staining, and area distinction was performed according to published guidelines70. We applied an optical fractionator stereological design (bilateral count) using the Stereo Investigator System (MicroBrightField Europe e.K.). A stack of MAC 5000 controller modules (Ludl Electronic Products, Ltd) was interfaced with an Olympus BX50 microscope with a motorized stage and a HV-C20 Hitachi digital camera with a Pentium II PC workstation. A three-dimensional optical fractionator counting probe (x, y, z dimension of 50 × 50 × 25 μm) was applied. The brain areas of VTA and SNpc were outlined using the 5 × objective and neuronal cells were marked with a × 100 oil-immersion objective. The brain area of LC was outlined using the × 5 objective and cells were marked with a × 40 oil-immersion objective. Data collection for cell counting was done by a researcher blind to the genotype of each animal.

Neurons were considered TH+ if they showed cytoplasmatic TH immunoreactivity, while they were considered TH− if the nucleus was clearly visualized but cytoplasmic TH staining was absent.

The total neuronal number (TH+ and TH− for VTA and SNpc; TH+ for LC) was estimated according to the formula:

where SQ represents the number of neurons counted in all optically sampled fields of the area of interest (VTA, SNpc or LC), ssf is the section sampling fraction, asf is the area sampling fraction and tsf is the thickness sampling fraction.

For TUNEL staining, brains were removed as before and cut in coronal slices (10 μm thickness). Every tenth slice was processed for TUNEL. After removal of paraffin with xylene and rehydration in ethanol solutions of decreasing concentration, sections were digested with proteinase K (20 μg ml−1, 15 min), washed in distilled water and exposed briefly to 3% H O . The TUNEL reaction was performed using the Apoptag Plus Peroxidase In-Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore). TUNEL-positive cells were revealed with diaminobenzidine and H O according to the supplier’s instructions. Stained slices were lightly Nissl-counterstained with cresyl violet. Cells were defined as apoptotic if they were TUNEL-positive or if they showed typical nuclei with condensed chromatin or nuclear fragmentation or both. TUNEL-positive cells within the anatomical boundaries of VTA and SNpc (ref. 70) were counted at × 100 magnification with a Leitz DMRB microscope.

Mice, anaesthetized with Zoletil and Rompun, were mounted on a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) and implanted unilaterally with microdialysis probes 24–36 h before experiments. The concentric dialysis probes (AN69 fibres, Hospal Dasco) were implanted vertically at the level of the hippocampus (AP −3.0, ML±2.7 from bregma)70, NAc shell (AP +1.6, ML±0.2) and striatum (AP +1.0, ML±1.8). The probe lengths were 5 mm for hippocampus (3 mm membrane), 5.5 mm for NAc shell (1 mm) and 4.5 mm for striatum (2 mm). Each probe was fixed and the skin was sutured. Mice were returned to their home cages and the outlet and inlet probe tubing were protected by locally applied parafilm. Membranes were tested for in vitro recovery before surgery. On the day of the experiment each animal was placed in a circular cage containing microdialysis equipment: the microdialysis probe was connected to a CMA/100 pump (Carnegie Medicine) through PE-20 tubing and an ultra low torque multichannel power-assisted swivel (Model MCS5, Instech Laboratories) to allow free movement. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; in mM: NaCl 140; KCl 4; CaCl 1.2; MgCl 1) was pumped through the dialysis probe (2.1 μl min−1). Following the start of the dialysis perfusion, mice were left undisturbed for ∼1 h before the collection of three baseline samples to calculate the average basal concentration. Dialysate samples were collected every 20 min for 60 min. Brains were then postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cut in coronal slices (100 μm) and processed for methylene blue staining. The correct positioning of the probes was confirmed under a microscope. Data from animals not showing proper placement were discarded.

Each dialysate sample (20 μl) was analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations (pg 20 μl−1) were not corrected for probe recovery. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography apparatus (ACQUITY, Waters Corporation) was coupled to an amperometric detector (Decade II, Antec Leyden) containing an in situ Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an electrochemical flow-cell (VT-03, Antec Leyden) with a 0.7 mm glassy carbon electrode, mounted with a 25 mm spacer. The electrochemical flow-cell, set at a potential of 400 mV, was positioned immediately after a BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm particle size; Waters Corporation). The column was kept at 37 °C (0.07 ml min−1 flow rate). The composition of the mobile phase was (in mM): 50 phosphoric acid, 8 KCl, 0.1 EDTA, 2.5 1-octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 12% MeOH and pH 6.0 adjusted with NaOH. Peak height obtained by oxidation of DA and noradrenaline was compared with that produced by a standard. The detection limit was 0.1 pg.

Acute brain slices (250–300 μm) were obtained following halothane anaesthesia and decapitation. The brain was rapidly removed and coronal slices containing the striatum and NAc core/shell or parasagittal slices containing the dorsal hippocampus were cut with a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) in chilled bubbled (95% O , 5% CO ) aCSF containing (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 3, NaH PO 1.25, NaHCO 26, MgCl 1, CaCl 2, glucose 10 (∼290 mOsm, pH 7.4). Slices were incubated for 1 h in aCSF at 32 °C and then transferred at room temperature for at least 30 min before recordings. A single brain slice was transferred to a recording chamber and completely submerged in aCSF (3–4 ml min−1; 32 °C).

Amperometric detection of DA in acute brain slices containing the striatum and the NAc was performed using carbon fibre electrodes (diameter 30 μm, length 100 μm, World Precision Instruments) positioned near a bipolar Ni/Cr stimulating electrode, to a depth of 50–150 μm into the coronal slice. The imposed voltage (MicroC potentiostat, World Precision Instruments) between the carbon fibre electrode and the Ag/AgCl pellet was 0.55 V. For stimulation, a single rectangular electrical pulse was applied using a DS3 Stimulator (Digitimer) every 5 min along a range of stimulation intensities (20–1,000 μA, 20–40 μs duration). In response to a protocol of increasing stimulation, a plateau of DA release was reached at the maximal stimulation intensity (1,000 μA, 40 μs). Signals were digitized with Digidata 1440A coupled to a computer running pClamp 10 (both from Molecular Devices). Electrode calibration was performed at the end of each experiment by bath-perfused DA (0.3–10 μM).

A parasagittal acute slice containing the dorsal hippocampus was placed over an 8 × 8 array of planar electrodes, each 50 × 50 μm in size, with an interpolar distance of 150 μm (MED-P5155, Alpha MED Sciences), adjusted so that the entire CA1 pyramidal layer and stratum radiatum were covered with underlying electrodes. The slice was kept submerged using a platinum ring covered with nylon mesh. Voltage signals were recorded with the MED64 System (Alpha MED Sciences) and digitized at 20 kHz followed by filtering at 0.1–1 Hz with a 6071E Data Acquisition Card (National Instruments), using Mobius software (Alpha MED Sciences). Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation (100 μs duration) through one of the 64 planar electrodes placed in the stratum radiatum. The recording channel with the highest fEPSP amplitude, at a distance of at least 300 μm from the stimulation site, was chosen as recording site. Input–output curves were obtained by measuring the fEPSP initial slope at increasing 5 μA steps of afferent stimulation, delivered every 30 s. PPR was evaluated with pairs of stimuli, at half-maximal amplitude, separated by 20–500 ms. For LTP experiments, after at least 20 min of test stimulation (half-maximal shock, every 30 s) to assess fEPSP slope stability, the slice was challenged with a conditioning train at 100 Hz for 1 s, followed by test stimulation for at least 1 h. The degree of LTP was evaluated by the fEPSP mean slope at 55–60 min from the conditioning train, normalized to the mean slope during baseline. To study the acute effect of L-DOPA (Tocris) and of the selective DA receptor agonists SKF38393 (D1 receptor; Tocris) and quinpirole (D2 receptor; Tocris) on LTP, slices were continuously perfused throughout the experiment with aCSF containing the drugs at their final concentrations, prepared from concentrated stocks.

The striatum was dissected from acute coronal brain slices; the hippocampus was isolated from the entire brain. Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing (in mM) 320 sucrose, 50 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 5 β-glycerophosphate, 5 NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail, incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min. The total protein content of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method.

To evaluate APPswe levels, the hippocampus was dissected from parasagittal brain slices; NAc and striatum were dissected from coronal brain slices; VTA was dissected from horizontal brain slices. Tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing (in mM) 50 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 5 MgCl , 1 EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 5 β-glycerophosphate, 5 NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail, sonicated and incubated on ice for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000g for 20 min and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method.

To evaluate palatable food-induced CPP, we used a two-chamber apparatus made of two Plexiglas chambers (15 × 15 × 20 cm) that differ in the pattern and the colour of the grid, connected by a central compartment (15 × 5 × 20 cm) with two sliding doors (4 × 20 cm). In each chamber two triangular parallelepipeds (5 × 5 × 20 cm), made of black Plexiglas and arranged in various patterns, were used as conditioned stimuli. The lighting conditions (visual and tactile cues) were adjusted to prevent preference for a certain chamber. On the pre-conditioning day, each mouse was left in the central alley and allowed free access and exploration of the adjacent chambers of the apparatus, in the absence of food for 15 min. During the following 6 days (conditioning session), each mouse was confined daily for 30 min alternately in one of the two chambers. One of the patterns was consistently paired with palatable food (0.5 g milk chocolate, Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate providing 5.31 kcal g−1 of energy; paired chamber) and the other with regular chow (RC, Mucedola 4RF21 diet; unpaired chamber). The RC pellet and the chocolate portion provided each day were designed to be isocaloric. Animals were randomly assigned to consume either chocolate or control diet. For each genotype group pairings were counterbalanced so that in half of the group chocolate was paired with one of the patterns and in the other half with the other. Testing was conducted on post-conditioning day using the pre-conditioning procedure during which the total time spent in each chamber was recorded. Animal behaviour was recorded with a CCD video camera, the signal was digitized and transferred to a computer. Data were analysed with the EthoVision XT software (Noldus) to obtain the time spent during pre- and post-conditioning sessions for each subject, used as raw data for preference scores in each sector of the apparatus. Chocolate consumption was assessed by averaging, after weighting, the residual amount of food at the end of chocolate-receiving days.

The apparatus consisted of a 21 × 21 × 49 cm chamber (Ugo Basile) with grey Plexiglas walls and transparent ceiling to allow video recordings. The grid floor (steel pieces spaced by 1.5 cm) was connected to a shock generator scrambler. The CFC test encompassed two sessions: training and context test. During training each mouse was placed in the chamber for 2 min of free exploration, followed by three non-signalled foot shocks (1 mA, 2 s duration, 60 s intervals) delivered through the grid floor. After 24 h, the subject was placed again for 5 min in the training chamber receiving no foot shock (context test). During training and context test the mouse behaviour was recorded. To evaluate aversive learning and memory, the total duration of freezing (behavioural immobility, except for respiration movements) exhibited during training and context test was manually scored by an observer blind to the experimental group of the specimen, through EthoVision XT software (Noldus).

For sub-synaptic fractionation of PSD, hippocampi were homogenized with a Dounce tissue grinder in homogenization buffer containing (in mM) 320 sucrose, 10 Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 EDTA, 1 NaHCO , 1 PMSF, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 5 NaF, 20 β-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor cocktail. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g (10 min) and the supernatant was again centrifuged at 10,000g (15 min). The pellet was homogenized in homogenization buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 with a Dounce tissue grinder, incubated 40 min on ice and centrifuged at 32,000g (20 min). The resulting pellet containing PSDs was processed for protein extraction. Briefly, the pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer containing (in mM) 50 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 5 MgCl , 1 EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 5 β-glycerophosphate, 5 NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail, was sonicated and incubated on ice for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged at 11,500g for 10 min and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method.

Proteins were applied to SDS–PAGE and electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting analysis was performed using a chemiluminescence detection kit. The relative levels of immunoreactivity were determined by densitometry using the ImageJ software. Primary antibodies: GluA1 (1:1,000; Millipore, 04-855), GluA1p-Ser845 (1:1,000; Millipore, AB5849; RRID: AB_92079), PSD-95 (1:1,000; Millipore, MAB1598; RRID: AB_94278), GluN2A (1:250; Santa Cruz, sc-1468; RRID: AB_670223), Actin (1:25,000; Sigma-Aldrich, A5060; RRID: AB_476738), D1 (1:1,000, Abcam, ab20066; RRID: AB_445306), D2 (1:1,000, Millipore, AB5084P; RRID: AB_2094980), αCaMKII (1:1,000, ThermoFisher, #13-7300; RRID: AB_2533032), TH (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab112; RRID: AB_297840), hAPP695 (APPswe, 1:500, Biolegend, #803001; RRID: AB_2564653). Secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000; Bio-Rad; RRID: AB_11125936), goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3,000; Bio-Rad; RRID: AB_11125142) and rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:3,000; Bio-Rad; RRID: AB_11125144).

Membranes were stripped using Re-Blot Plus Strong Solution (Millipore) for 15 min at room temperature. Full blots are shown in Supplementary Information.

To study the morphology of dendritic spines in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, brains were removed from the skull and impregnated with a Golgi-Cox solution. Brains were first immersed in a 5% Cr K O , 5%Cl Hg and 5% CrK O solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 days, then moved to a 30% sucrose solution for 3–5 days and finally sliced in 100 μm coronal sections at the CA1 level (−2.3 to −5.8 mm from bregma). Slices were sequentially washed with the following solutions: distilled water (1 min), H NO (Sigma-Aldrich; 30 min in the dark), distilled water (1 min), Kodak Fix-film (Sigma-Aldrich; 30 min in the dark), distilled water (1 min), sequentially in 50, 70 and 95% alcohol (1 min each), twice in 100% alcohol (5 min), in a solution of one-third xylene, one-third chloroform and one-third 100% alcohol (15 min), xylene (15 min). Slices were then coverslipped with Canada Balsam. The stained slices were analysed under a × 100 oil-immersion objective (Axioskop, Zeiss). During morphological analysis (Neurolucida v11, MicroBrightField) the specimen identity was unknown. A hippocampal pyramidal neuron was processed for morphological analysis if labelling was uniform, reaction precipitates were absent, if it did not overlap with neighbouring cells, if spines were clearly visible, dendritic arbours were relatively parallel to the section plane and arbours in distal dendritic branches were intact and visible. With these criteria, 30 CA1 pyramidal neurons were selected per group (WT sham, Tg2576 sham, WT sel and Tg2576 sel). The basal and apical dendritic arbours of each cell were examined separately using the software’s Sholl Analysis tool. Terminal spine density was calculated as number of spines (defined as protrusions of the dendritic membrane regardless of shape) along a 25 μm dendritic terminal segment.

Mice were placed in a circular white pool (diameter 145 cm) filled with 23±2 °C water made opaque by the addition of non-toxic acrylic white colour (Giotto). The protocol consisted of an 8-trial Cue phase (1 day) and a 20-trial Place phase followed by a 1-trial Probe phase (4 days). During Cue phase, a visible platform (5 cm diameter) emerged 0.5 cm over the water level and surmounted by small red plastic caps (to make it more evident) was placed in the middle of the pool. During Place phase, the escape platform (5 cm diameter) submerged 0.5 cm under the water level was placed in the middle of the north–west quadrant 20 cm from the side walls. The pool was positioned in a uniformly lighted room with various external cues and surmounted by a camera that relayed signals to a monitor and to the image analyzer (EthoVision XT, Noldus). The Cue phase was composed of two consecutive sessions (four 60 s-trials each; inter-trial interval: 20 min; and inter-session interval: 2 h). The Place phase was composed of four daily sessions (five 60 s-trials per day; inter-trial interval: 20 min). During the inter-trial and inter-session intervals, mice were placed in their home cages. At the start of each trial, mice were put into the pool at different quadrants for each subject and then retrieved after finding the visible or hidden platform. The mice that failed to find the platform within 60 s, were helped by the experimenter. When mice climbed the platform, they were allowed to remain on it for 20 s. To evaluate spatial memory, 1 h after the last trial of Place phase mice were subjected to the Probe phase, in which the platform was removed and the mice (released from the opposite side of the pool) were allowed to search for it for 30 s. Data analysis were performed using the following parameters: time spent to reach the platform during Cue and Place phases; percentage of distance swum in the target quadrant (previously containing the platform) during Probe phase.

CPP: data were analysed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs) with the genotype (Tg2576 versus WT) and chambers (paired versus unpaired) as independent factors. CPP data for selegiline treatment were analysed by two-way ANOVAs for treatment (sham versus sel) and chambers (paired versus unpaired). Chocolate consumption after selegiline was analysed with one-way ANOVA. Post hoc comparisons were performed with STATISTICA software (v8.0, StatSoft, Inc., 2007) using Tukey’s HSD test.

Microdialysis: data were analysed with one-way repeated measures ANOVAs with genotype (Tg2576 versus WT) as between-subject factor and time (20 min blocks, 3 levels) as within-subject factor. Microdialysis data in Tg2576 mice following selegiline treatment were analysed with one-way repeated measures ANOVAs for treatment (Tg sham versus Tg sel) and time (20 min blocks, 3 levels).

LTP: data for sub-chronic L-DOPA and selegiline treatment were analysed by two-way ANOVAs for genotype (Tg2576 versus WT) and treatment (sham versus drug). LTP data for the effect of bath administration of L-DOPA and DA receptor agonists on Tg2576 mice were analysed with one-way ANOVA. In both cases post hoc comparisons were assessed with Bonferroni’s test.

All other data were analysed with a two-tailed paired or unpaired Student’s t-test, as described in Figure legends. Data are presented as mean±s.e.m. Except for CPP, all statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v5.00). Values of P≤0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (shown in figures as *P≤0.05, **P≤0.01 and ***P≤0.001).

The number of samples in each group for immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent, stereological, microdialysis, electrophysiological, biochemical, behavioural and morphological evaluations were determined based on published studies. The experimenter performing surgeries was known to hit the targets used (NAc shell, striatum or hippocampus).

All randomization was performed by an experimenter. Animals used in all experiments were selected randomly. For CPP, animals were also counterbalanced across groups.

Dopaminergic dysfunction occurs in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The authors show that in a mouse model of AD, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, but not the substantia nigra, occurs at early pre-plaque stages, and may contribute to impaired cognition and reward processing.
