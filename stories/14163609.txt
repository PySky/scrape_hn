Behind every business, there’s always an individual. Someone with a problem that needs a solution.

This means that any marketer with a goal to bring in more leads, shouldn’t be targeting random companies. Instead, they should be targeting individuals with tasks to solve these problems.

But it might not be that easy!

Any person can at the same time be a parent, a spouse, a homeowner, a shopper, a traveller and an employee/employer. Always having various problems that differ based on the role they’re currently in.

Our job as the messengers is to understand who’s in what role and when do they change those hats.

Other times, helping with home or leisure related matters.

Nevertheless, transmitting our ideas towards the same people.

All in all, marketing always works the same way. You need to understand the pain of your target customer, while knowing when and where are they looking for potential solutions. Moreover, you need to be telling your story at those places for the maximum result!

If your product’s solving the right pain, while targeting them in the right channel you’ll get yourself a new customer. If not, then change your strategy and try again. Always measuring and learning!|||
