JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in his annual letter to investors, said he has high hopes for the U.S. but believes there is "something wrong" with the country as well.

"Our problems are significant, and they are not the singular purview of either political party. We need coherent, consistent, comprehensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problems," the head of the largest bank by assets in the U.S. wrote. "The solutions are not binary â€” they are not either/or, and they are not about Democrats or Republicans. They are about facts, analysis, ideas and best practices (including what we can learn from others around the world)."

Dimon noted that the U.S. is "an exceptional country," but he delineated numerous areas where the country needs to improve. Among them are low wage growth, high health-care and overcrowded prisons.|||

Dimon, in his annual letter to investors, expressed hope for the bank's future in large part because attitudes toward banking and business have changed.
