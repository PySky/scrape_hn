The Formula One season 2017 is marked by a massive change of technical regulations with wider tires, bigger wings and much more down force. During this webinar, we will put you in the seat of an aerodynamics engineer and investigate the impact of the new car design towards its aerodynamics, using fluid flow simulations (CFD) to understand the behavior of the flow around the car.

There is no prior knowledge or software required to join this workshop series. All participants will get free access to SimScale with all the required simulation features.

Who should register for Formula One Aerodynamics Webinar?

SimScale is the cloud-based platform for engineering simulation — CFD, FEA, Thermal analysis —where all engineers and designers, independent of their budget, IT infrastructure and simulation specific know-how can leverage simulation technology for their technical design work. No hardware or licenses are required to use SimScale. Only a normal laptop or PC and Internet connection.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the branch of CAE that allows you to simulate fluid motion using numerical approaches. The cloud-based CFD software component of SimScale allows the analysis of a wide range of problems related to laminar and turbulent flows, incompressible and compressible fluids, multiphase flows and more — everything 100% in your browser, eliminating the barrier of limited computing power, accessibility and cost.|||
