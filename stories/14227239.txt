Tatra was a Czech luxury car manufacturer founded in the 1840s, and which manufactured passenger cars up until 1999, and continue to this day to build trucks and lorries.

It was a luxury executive saloon car which entered production in 1956, and stayed with us until 1975 when it was replaced by the much more sedate-seeming 613.|||
