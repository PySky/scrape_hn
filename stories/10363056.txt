UPDATE: All services have returned and a Google spokesperson provided us with the following statement:

Google Drive, Docs editors and Classroom have been restored for 99.5% of affected users as of 1:01 PM Pacific, and for the remaining 0.5% of users by 2:10 PM Pacific. During the event, our top priority was to restore service. We are now turning our attention to understanding what caused the outage; our preliminary diagnosis is that this was caused by a code push which behaved differently in widespread use than it had during testing. If you were affected, we apologize for the disruption this caused. We are calculating the impact to our business customers and will issue SLA credits as appropriate. Full details will follow in our incident report.

If you’ve noticed that Google Drive and all of the apps that save to it are acting a bit shaky today, you’re not alone. Google updated their Apps status page to show that the company is looking into reported issues.

It’s showing up as a “service disruption” so nothing is down completely. But nothing is loading either.

My personal experience is that the products mentioned above are running ridiculously slow, with files not loading at all. Both for my personal account and business account.

So you know. Here’s your daily reminder: Always be local.

We’ve reached out to Google for further comment and will update once we hear back.
