Namecheap is my favorite domain registrar. Not only because they are cheap but because they have not given me any issues in the last 9 years.

Not only that, they just saved my ass.

So if you sign-up for everything like I do, your Gmail inbox would be pretty full. I have 24,988 unread emails across two inboxes. (One for personal & work)

My namecheap emails goes into my personal one. This one has the bulk of the emails, 22,804 unreads. I know, I have bad email habits.

Gmail thinks it’s doing me a favor by splitting up my email into “Important” and “Everything Else”. Unfortunately these renewal emails got slipped into “Everything Else”.

Also the last couple months, I’ve been good and haven’t bought any new domain names. Little did I know, the combination of bad email habits, and not buying new domain names, caused two of my domain names to expire!

Gladly I was still able to renew one of the domain names with the dreaded Expired mark.

I added the domain to the cart and went to checkout. This is when I got: “Domain has expired. Please reactivate your domain.”

So maybe I can’t renew the domain name after all. I wondered if they withdraw the funds already, I better hope on their Live help chat to find out.

Their Live help chat was amazing. They gave me the good news that, it went through and that I successfully renewed it.

Apparently there’s a 27 day grace period (non-guaranteed). So I could still renew my domain. This was the 27th day, so I got lucky.

Unfortunately my other non-plural domain name expired a day previous, and I didn’t have the option to put that renewal in my shopping cart.

But before I left the call, I took a stab and asked: “Is there anything you can do about my other domain, I am only a day late.”

And two my amazement I was able to get both domain names back. 🙂

p.s. I’m not sure how I managed to get them both back. Perhaps it was a timezone thing, but it’s good to be lucky. Stay on top of your domain renewals!|||
