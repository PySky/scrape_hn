The world is becoming a global village. With people travelling far and wide and to unknown places the taxi business is fast booming. In general concept, we need taxi where we do not know the route or when we don’t have our own vehicle to commute but in the modern and urban world, we need taxi as we don’t have enough parking places at our destinations or we have parking lots very far from the destination, thus a taxi offers a door step solution by dropping us to the nearest point to the destination and without bothering for the parking we get down to work. Large taxi business has already started creating Uber clone App For their  business

 People are more and more dependent on the vehicle for transport and with competition becoming strong and roads getting congested we require on-demand taxi app services. As per the statistics mentioned in Profitable Venture , the US alone has around 7000 firms doing such business and generating revenues of around $6billion. Where as in developing countries like India the revenue generated from taxi services is around $9 billion as per the statistics of Redseer.

When we talk about Taxi, we just mean a car taken on rent with professional driver from source to destination. However, with changing economy and varied requirements the meaning of taxi is changing. Taxi services are no longer limited to just car rentals it is much more than that. It can be any of the following:

The list is exhaustive with new and new services coming on day to day basis. With new concepts people can be in taxi business even without owning their own taxi. Uber, Ola, Meru, TaxiforSure are examples of the same. Thus the taxi services which was capital based business is shifting paradigm to service based business.

With technology penetrating in all businesses, there are tremendous growth and diversification opportunities in business. The reason for quick growth in taxi industry is the use of technology like gps based mobile application or on demand mobile taxi application which has revolutionized the way taxi business is being run. The mobile taxi application allows you to book a cab with your smart phone. The application accesses your location and gives you the location of the nearest taxi to your location and when you book it, you are texted the drivers mobile number and cab registration number and your request is shared with the driver. This is very simple with the use of on demand taxi application like careem or easytaxi.
