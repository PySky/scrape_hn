Moving old ReactJS codebase to Clojurescript? Tired of manually typing ReactJS examples as Clojurescript?

This is command utility and library to convert JSX snippets to Om/Reagent/Rum Clojurescript-style format. Note, this is by no means to be perfect JS->Cljs compiler, output will often still need touch of your loving hand, but, hey, most of dirty work will be done

This library uses acorn-jsx to parse JSX into nice AST. So big kudos there. Since it's Node.js library, you can use this library only in Clojurescript targeted to Node.js

I also made workflow, you can download it here Following things are needed:

Use it with keyword and paste JSX. To change command line arguments for all following queries use and type arguments. Don't put arguments into , only JSX string.

Okay let's start with something simple

Now something more nested...

Conditions and anonymous functions are okay too!

Mapping? No problem! Notice how doesn't require any more editing

Still not impressed? We can do spread attributes too!

Reagent can do neat trick with ids and classes

Alright folks, that's enough of examples, I guess you get the picture . If you saw error like ERROR: Don't know how to handle node type <something> it means I haven't implmented some JS syntax yet. Open issue or PR :)

If interested, library is extendable, you can easily add other targets other than Om/Reagent (with a single function!)|||
