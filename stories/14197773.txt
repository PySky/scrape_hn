Canopy Labs has now worked with over 400 companies that are interested in optimizing their customer journeys. During our five years working in this space, we have seen numerous varieties of skill sets, data sets, and capabilities. In an effort to help bridge the gap between what exists today and marketers’ aspirations, we are unveiling the first version of our Customer Experience Maturity Model (CXMM).

The CXMM is a five-step maturity model that tracks an organization’s or department’s data-centric and marketing-centric capabilities. For managers and department heads, it helps provide an overview of where they are today, and what are the steps they need to take to move to the next level of customer experience capability development — and ultimately, revenue growth.

In an effort to help all B2C marketers, we are releasing this without a signup wall. Please feel free to share, promote among your colleagues, and let us know you have any questions.|||
