doesn’t complain about pushing to or pulling from even if that’s an insecure registry. Ooooh.

So: should push to a registry named and inside minikube, should pull from a registry named .

The idea here is for the docker daemon on minikube to be able to pull from a registry called localhost:5000. This is achieved by actually running a registry on minikube and then setting up a proxy so that the minikube VM port 5000 maps to the registry’s 5000.

Now, we need to make sure that the docker daemon on thinks that is legit. So, we map 5000 of the ⇢ 5000 of the host (via a reverse SSH tunnel) and 5000 of the host ⇢ 5000 of the registry running on minikube (via ). Ofcourse, if you’re one of the enlightened, you’re already running a linux host and of your 99 problems this ain’t one.

So here are all the steps finally:

Create a registry (a replication-controller and a service) and create a proxy to make sure the minikube VM’s 5000 is proxied to the registry service’s 5000.

At this point, should work and give you a response from the docker registry.

After this, from the host should return a valid response from the docker registry running on minikube

After this, running should return a valid response from the docker registry running on minikube.

All of this put toghether, and finally:|||

If you’re developing with minikube you need to use containers. Containers need images, and during development you may want to frequently modify images. To complete your development workflow you need…
