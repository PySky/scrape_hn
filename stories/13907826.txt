Recently I’ve been testing clusters of VMs running on my local host.

I thought that there must be a standard way to test multi-node VM setups, but asking around at work, and on github yielded no answers.

So I came up with my own solution, which I outline here.

A ShutItFile is a superset of a Dockerfile that allows straighforward automation of automation tasks.

Here’s an example of a ShutItFile that manipulates two VMs, and tests network connectivity between them.

It creates two machines (machine1 and machine2) and logs into them in turn using the ‘VAGRANT_LOGIN’ directive. On each machine it installs python, sets up a simple python http server which serves the text: ‘Hi from machine1’ (from machine1) or ‘Hi from machine2’ from machine2.

It then tests that the output matches expectation from both machines using the ‘ASSERT_OUTPUT’ directive.

To demonstrate the ‘testing’ nature of the ShutItFile, a ‘PAUSE_POINT’ directive is included, which drops you into the run with a terminal, and a deliberately wrong ‘ASSERT_OUTPUT’ directive is included to show what happens when a test fails (and the terminal is interactive). This makes debugging a _lot_ easier.

To run this ShutItFile (which we call here ‘ShutItFile.sf’), you run like this:

This code for this example is available here.

There’s a video of the above run here:

If you want to create your own multinode test:

Follow the instructions, choosing ‘shutitfile’ as the pattern, and ‘vagrant’ as the delivery method, eg:

and follow the commands given (at the place in bold above) to run.

Initially you are given empty ShutItFiles. You could start by adding the commands from the example here.

A cheatsheet for the various ShutItFile commands is available here.

Watch me do this here.

As an example of real-world usage, this technique is being used to regression test Chef recipes used to provision OpenShift.

The Chef scripts are here, and the regression tests are here.|||
