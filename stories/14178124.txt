I was persuaded by buddy Mr H to make a YouTube channel out of my Source Code in TV and Film Tumblr. The Tumblr shows the source code that flashes by on computer screens in films and TV programmes and look at its heritage.This is sometimes surprising, funny, or relevant, and often ridiculous. For the first experimental episode I looked at what I believe is an Easter Egg in the original Iron Man film:I would be interested to hear people's thoughts on this format.The second episode is a forensic examination of the opening sequence of the Doctor Who episode The Bells of Saint John|||
