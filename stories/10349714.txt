A jury has found former Tribune Media employee and social media news maven Matthew Keys guilty of three computer fraud felonies related to a 2010 defacement of the Los Angeles Times website by a member of the Anonymous hacking group.

On its second day of deliberation, a jury in U.S. District Court in Sacramento this afternoon found Keys guilty of all three counts levied by prosecutors, who first indicted Keys in 2013. He was fired from his position as deputy social media editor at Reuters shortly after his indictment.

Keys shared logon credentials of the Tribune company’s content management system, then also used by the L.A. Times, with an Anonymous hacker, along with the instruction to “go f--- some s--- up!”

That led to an obscene version of an article about congressional Democratic reaction to a tax bill that was quickly reverted to its original state.

Keys faces up to 25 years in jail and $750,000 in fines. However, he's likely to receive a lighter sentence in accordance with federal sentencing guidelines judges usually follow.

Defense attorneys immediately vowed to appeal, charging prosecutors with stretching the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act beyond its intent by accusing Keys of “computer damage,” since the vandalism was short-lived. They contended any financial damage was less than the $5,000 needed to invoke the federal laws at issue and that it was unfair to consider vague damages such as harm to the reputation of companies involved.|||
