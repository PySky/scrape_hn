If this video is real, it’s got to be one of the best ones we’ve seen this year.

One lucky witness was able to capture footage of a slow moving dark disc over a busy highway in Morelia, Mexico. And since he was driving at the same time, we have to commend him for multitasking.

The mysterious craft exhibits almost graceful movements and is completely silent, which is a strong indication that the object is of extraterrestrial origins.

According to the witness, the event took place on March 27 on a highway north of the city of Morelia in the state of Michoacán.

After analyzing the video, I can offer two conclusions: the object seems real and it looks like there’s a booger on the steering wheel.|||
