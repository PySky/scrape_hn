While the 3DS software library is primarily comprised of games, there are a handful of useful apps that are also available for those who might be interested. More often than not, these are more educational in nature; revolving more around teaching the user a particular skill than solely existing for entertainment value. One such app that emerged originally on the DSi was Petit Computer, software that aimed to teach the user the basics of game development through a programming language known as BASIC.

The successor â€“ known as SmileBASIC - to this somewhat popular DSi app has just been given a release date in North America. According to Nintendo's main page for the game, we'll be receiving this on the eShop on 15th October. SmileBASIC will aim to do much of what its predecessor did, but now there will be expanded functionality, such as support for numerous new control schemes and cloud storage for sharing games and levels with other users. If you'd like to know a bit more about what this software will be offering, check out this interview we conducted with the developer a few years back. Though the interview was about Petit Computer, much of the same functionality will be present in this upcoming release
