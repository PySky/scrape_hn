Departing SFO last week, I peered out my window at a rare site: a gigantic Russian Antonov An-124 cargo jet parked across the runways from airport terminals. I thought it was a one-time event, but I began hearing more about it from TravelSkills readers who have seen one or two of the behemoths over the last two weeks at SFO. [FULL STORY]

I reached out to airport officials at SFO to inquire about the planes, but only received vague replies: “Yes, we’ve had theseat times having two here simultaneously. None are here now, but the next one comes in.”

When I asked why they are here, what they are transporting and where they are going, the airport said, “They’re coming from various locations, all for the same Bay Area company. I don’t have details on who…” [more]

So I did a little digging around and found out that a lot of aviation geeks are equally interested in what’s up with these big birds making regular appearances at SFO. Last night, I saw one of them fly over the city enroute to SFO at about 8 pm.

TravelSkills blog readers have speculated that the planes are here to pick up a big shipment of Teslas…or bringing in parts for a huge crane for a construction project.

On Tuesday, the excellent flight tracking site/app FlightRadar24 shows one of the planes (VI4819) departing Leipzig, Germany. Today, one left for Columbus, Ohio … more….

A planespotter near SFO was surprised at his luck seeing the Antonov and shot this video of it on April 24:

Compared to an Airbus A380, the Antonov An-124 is slightly smaller: It is 226 feet long vs the A380 at 238 feet. And its wingspan is a bit narrower: 241 feet for the An124 vs 261 for the Airbus A380.

Have you seen this plane at SFO? Know anything about it? Please leave your comments, tips or speculation below.
