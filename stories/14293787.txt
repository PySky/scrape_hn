This video details the development of a prototype skateboarding game titled Sonic The Hedgehog Extreme. Sonic Extreme was developed by Vision Scape Interactive, and was originally developed without SEGA's consent. The project reused technology developed by Vision Scape for their Tech Deck Playset software, as well as a cancelled game based on Nickelodeon's Rocket Power cartoon. Vision Scape presented the pitch to Sonic Team's Yuji Naka, and Naka seemed to be impressed. Communication from SEGA broke down after this meeting however, and the project progressed no further. Around two years later, SEGA demonstrated their new title, Sonic Riders, which resembled Vision Scape's pitch. Vision Scape hoped that the project would find its way to Xbox, Gamecube, and PlayStation 2 (PS2) once it was finished.
