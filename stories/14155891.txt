Two reasons: 1. private repositories have the tendency to become public due to account owners efforts to save money on their GitHub expenses. It’s very easy to turn a private reposiory into a public one. The thing is that you never know what’s inside when you do it, so you better keep secrets off private repositories as well. 2. Code in private repositories still have wider inter-org access and exposure than other means of storing keys. Exposed keys can therefore be maliciously used by -- let’s say -- frustrated employees (or ex-employees). You shouldn’t keep the keys exposed in the code.|||
