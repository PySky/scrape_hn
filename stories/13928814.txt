A few months ago, Samsung announced that they were working on a new virtual assistant, supposed to be their take at Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana. Going by the name of Bixby, the assistant was expected to make its debut on March 29, on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, as the two handsets are rumored to have a special button for launching it.

However, the South Korean manufacturer announced Bixby a bit earlier, confirming that the S8 will be the first phone to use it!

Unlike other existing virtual assistants, Bixby will be deeply integrated within the apps supporting it, so it will be able to perform all functions through voice commands or by simply tapping on the display.

For example, if you want to sort the photos in your gallery, everything you need to do is ask the assistant, as it can see the context of your actions, the understand the app’s current state, making it blend in with the overall user experience.

Samsung also announced that Bixby won’t be that rigid in terms of voice commands, so users don’t need to use just specific phrases in order to use it properly. The assistant can process commands that have incomplete information, then perform the task in the best way possible. Basically, the more time you spend using it, the better it gets.

The manufacturer will offer an SDK, so developers can integrate the assistant into their apps, while the Galaxy S8 itself will feature several apps supporting it, out of the box.|||

Samsung officially introduced the Bixby Virtual assistant today, and it will be first to use on upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ Smartphones.
