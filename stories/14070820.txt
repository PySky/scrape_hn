Forget getting kicked out of Austin — Uber just got banned from an entire country.

The ride-hailing service is now blocked in Italy after a judge ruled Friday that it created unfair competition.

Unlike rulings in other European countries, where the use of UberX or the European version (UberPop) has been limited, Italy's ruling blocks all of Uber's services: UberBLACK, UberLUX, UberX, UberXL and UberSelect among them.

Italy's taxi associations succeeded in winning the ruling after they brought a lawsuit against Uber to court. In addition to its ban against Uber operating, the ruling also prevents Uber from advertising in Italy at all.

Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Mashable, but the company told Reuters that they were "shocked" by the decision and planned to appeal.

Good news for Uber: another judge ruled that Uber can keep operating until the company finishes appealing their total ban. So you can order an Uber in Italy again, for now.

"We are happy for the thousands of Italian drivers and riders who can now continue using the Uber app until the court's appeal ruling," Uber said in a statement. "We will continue fighting this judgement in the hope that Italians will be able to enjoy the benefits of modern technology that provides reliable transportation at the push of a button."|||
