Previously Yaakuro worked to make Unreal Engine 4 work with SteamVR using OpenGL on Linux, but now he's moved onto making it work with Vulkan!Amazing to see such progress and I really hope his patches get accepted into the Unreal Engine 4 base.Unreal Engine 4 does have a lot of Linux issues, since multiple games are blaming engine issues for not coming to Linux yet. Maybe Yaakuro can look into these issues once he's done with his VR work.|||
