A letter in my own handwriting.

I learned Python in 1998, and I used it pretty much daily through my working life. Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the AxiDraw pen plotter has a Python binding, I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.

It has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.

I've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.

Edit: In the comments a couple of people asked for a video. I will make a proper video with the AxiDraw as soon as I can. We just did a quick test on my wife's Cricut craft cutter. It works there too, though you can't tilt the pen or change the pressure. So apologies it's not the proper plotter, but you can see how the paths are traced on this video.|||
