Online communities built on Slack are skyrocketing. See the full list of those

We’re excited to see how communities on Slack are steadily growing day by day. People from different countries and backgrounds discuss a various range of topics in these communities. It is a source of valuable information and contacts we use every day at Standuply. We decided to compose a list of Slack communities for your own good. It took Dmitrij Yanin several weeks and after he finished it on 22nd of Aug, the list contained 300 communities.

Update from 06-Sept: We’re glad that many of you liked the list and have been sending us links with other communities. We decided to look for more, especially for non-IT Slack communities. And now the list contains 425 communities. Can we make it to 500? :)

And by the way we created a Github repo and now it’s a lot easier to add new Slack teams.
