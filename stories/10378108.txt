Everyone pretty much cuts the cake in the same way - but you’ve been doing it wrong for your entire life.

That’s right - there is actually a scientific way to cut up your cake goodness, and it will keep the sponge moist and the cream soft for days.

The standard way to cut up a cake is to roughly estimate where the centre is and cut from there to the edge, before cutting a rough-sized angle to create a triangle slice.

However, this leaves it exposed to dry out quickly, meaning day number two’s slice is a massive disappointment.

But the scientific method, unearthed by baking fans at IFLScience, states that slices are cut into rectangles - and your cake will keep its goodness for a lot longer than you are used to.

Are you ready to have your mind blown? Here’s how you do it:

Firstly, cut the cake into quarters so you have four, equal-sized triangular portions.

If you can resist eating one of those chunks, then the next step is to cut next to the same line made when slicing it in half.

What you should be left with are two rectangular slices ready to be enjoyed.

Then, simply push the remainder of the cake together - this will keep everything fresh as you are essentially stopping any air from drying out the inside.

This ingenious method was devised in 1906 by a mathematician who wanted his cake soft and creamy.

Eating cake has, unbelievably, just got even better.|||
