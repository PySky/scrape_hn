For this third edition of “Distributed Systems,” the material has been thoroughly revised and extended, integrating principles and paradigms into nine chapters:

A separation has been made between basic material and more specific subjects. The latter have been organized into boxed sections, which may be skipped on first reading.

To assist in understanding the more algorithmic parts, example programs in Python have been included. The examples in the book leave out many details for readability, but the complete code will be made available soon.

You can order a printed version of the book through Amazon.com.|||
