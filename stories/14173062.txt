“If children are taken away, judges will always try to return them if that is safe.

“Another thing is that children are not taken away from their parents simply because the parents have lied about something.  Even if they do tell lies they can still be good enough parents.

“People can tell lies about some things and still tell the truth about other things.

“Also, children are not taken away because parents are rude or difficult or because they have strange views, even if those views offend people.

“The only reason to take children away is because they need protecting from harm.”

It then details a history of erratic behaviour by Mr A, a former soldier who spent time in prison for robbery before becoming a born-again Christian, a faith he maintained for less than a year before converting to Islam.

During his Christian phase he went to see the headmistress of the children’s school accusing her of teaching “witchcraft” and left her so frightened she had a panic alarm installed in her office.

He also objected to his children having injections and even a story they were reading at school.

After his conversion he rapidly began to espouse increasingly extreme views – so much so that local Muslims alerted counter-terrorism police.

Last summer, having already previously tried to go to Syria, he suddenly got the family passports and started planning a £4,000 trip to France, Morocco and Turkey, promising to take the children to Disneyland in Paris. In the event they stayed only two nights in the French capital, without seeing the promised sights.

“He never had any intention of going to Euro Disney and it was unkind to [the children] to have promised it to them,” the judge noted.

“They did not even see the Eiffel Tower, which Mr A told me is ‘a lump of scrap metal’.”|||

It is the kind of document in which one might expect to find daunting legal terminology, interspersed with Latin phrases or even a smattering of Norman French.
