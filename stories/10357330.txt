As part of their time at CERN, the band visited The Synchrocyclotron, peeked in on the action in the ATLAS Experiment Control Room, and were interviewed by ATLAS physicists Tova Holmes and Larry Lee for their In Particular podcast. For the upcoming episode, the band members spoke about their experience -- what they learned about physics and how this sparked their day-long musical experimentation, next to the equipment that makes the science at CERN possible every day.|||
