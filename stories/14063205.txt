We’re on the verge of a quantum computing revolution. Entirely new devices will replace tiny transistors on silicon chips with atomic-scale processors capable of executing exponentially more calculations per second than today’s biggest and fastest supercomputers. The first likely application of such machines would be to accurately model nature at the atomic level. This could lead to life-saving drug design and entirely new ways of harnessing the power of chemistry.

After that, the possibilities seem endless.

While teams around the world are racing to build the first large-scale prototypes of a quantum computer, including the top minds at Google and Microsoft, engineers at the University of New South Wales in Australia are tackling a related challenge: quantum memory. In late March, the researchers published the first-ever demonstration of storing and retrieving quantum data from the nucleus of a solitary atom embedded in silicon.

Quantum physicist Andrea Morello leads the team at UNSW, which has taken a novel approach to building a quantum computer using a single atom of phosphorus. Quantum computers are powered by atomic-scale nodes called quantum bits, or “qubits.” Morello’s team built a proof-of-concept quantum computer where the system’s two qubits are the nucleus and a single orbiting electron of the phosphorus atom.|||
