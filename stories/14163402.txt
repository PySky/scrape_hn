Schools have always been implementing all essential measures to ensure the safety of the students. However, in a hurry to implement the measures, they happen to miss out something at the end, thus leading to fatalities. The best way to tackle this issue is by creating a road safety checklist for school buses.

Here is what you must include in your checklist:

Here are the steps to check the efficiency of braking systems:

Step 1: Check whether the air pressure is at maximum while starting the school bus     and also make sure that air pressure remains constant when you switch off the     vehicle engine

Step 2: Press and hold the brake pedal in such a way that it drops a little and then it     remains constant

Step 3: If the pressure goes on decreasing, it indicates that the braking system is      having an air leak

Step 4: Start the school bus and pump the brake till the pressure becomes half of the     braking system. The low pressure indicator must produce a buzzing sound as well as     a flashing light

Step 5: Make sure that air pressure adjusts and recharge to the maximum

Step 6: Braking system should be checked on a weekly basis

If school bus safety is your priority, ensure that all the above mentioned things are checked before the school bus starts its journey.|||
