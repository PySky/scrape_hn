How many emails should I expect to see? 

 It really depends on how many companies or which industries you subscribe to. We recommend subscribing to 'ALL' initially and then adjusting once you settle in on particular industries. For reference, 77 companies offered an IPO in 2015.

Am I likely to make a lot of money? 

 Sure, you can make a ton of money by investing in IPOs, but at the same time you can lose a lot of money. In 2015, the most successful IPO raised 267%, while the worst IPO lost 29%. Initial public offerings are volatile and can be risky investments. Please, do thorough research and evaluate your financial situation before making any kind of investment.

How soon before the IPO will I hear about it? 

 There's no set filing time before a company can hit market, but as a general rule of thumb we typically see the filing go through 1 to 2 weeks before the offering. Although, on the extreme ends we have seen up to a month before and as short notice as the day of.|||
