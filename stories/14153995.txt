Many studies confirm something we’ve all felt ourselves, sleep is better in nature. Closer to the ground, the body is in direct, uninterrupted contact with the Earth’s magnetic field, and it syncs its bio-rhythm to the planet’s.

In 1952, a German physicist named W.O. Schumann that there is a resonant magnetic field between the planet’s surface and the Ionosphere. This planetary magnetic resonance, known as Schumann Resonance, is in the spectrum between 1 Hz to more than 100 Hz.

The reason we don’t sleep well is obvious. Sleep quality and health is negatively affected due to radio frequencies being broadcast at a large scale into our ionosphere. These findings by EarthPulse about EMF Pollution suggest rate of emissions standing at billions of Watts per hour, 24 by 7!

We know that mitochondria (power houses of the cells) are not able to perform at optimum levels due to this magnetic interference. Studies show, exposure to nutritious magnetic field that are close to the frequency of the Brainwaves for deep-sleep state, lead to enhanced cellular functioning, resulting in longevity and cellular detox.

So using pulsating magnetic fields for Brainwave Entrainment results in both - sleep quality that you haven’t experienced in decades as well as performance enhancement.|||
