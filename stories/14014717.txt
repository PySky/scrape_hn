In this video, I am going to test the database part of the login and sign up activity. 



When user signs up, it will store the details of that user in the database. We've created a contact class and table to store all the information about each user that signs up using this app. Now, we are going to make the remaining small changes and test this app using an AVD (Android virtual device).

Then in the login activity, when a user types the username and password, it'll will search for that username and find respective password. If the typed password matches with this one then user will successfully sign up else it will show a toast error message.



Thank you for watching.
