It Just Works. Easier than ever before!

We have started a big work on the PIO Unified Debugger, a tool which supports multiple debugging interfaces, IDEs, development platforms, architectures and works with ZERO-Configuration. Yes, the simple click on "Debug" button in your favorite IDE and you are ready to debug PlatformIO Project.

The project can contain multiple environments with different boards/architectures. Also, you can debug simultaneously the same project with multiple debug environments.

!!! No need to install extra software, prepare firmware for debugging or spend time on debug tool configuration. All should work without extra steps, PIO resolves this complicated work automatically "on-the-fly" !!!

Please reply to this thread with all details:|||
