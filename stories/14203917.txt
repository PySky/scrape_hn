Is Growth Hacking a myth, buzz word or something else? Isn’t Growth Hacking the same thing as Digital Marketing? How do you differentiate Growth Hackers from other marketers? Do you know how I can make X number of users for free?

These are the questions people ask me when I say that I run a Growth Hacking agency. Unfortunately (or luckily for someone), there are a lot of groups on the Internet (Facebook groups, Twitter, LinkedIn groups, Reddit, other forums…) that focus on hacks and some quick, white hat and black hat tactics that promise some extra results.

Everyone in the startup world is familiar with stories of AirBnB, Uber, PayPal, DropBox and their ultra successful tactics. And all of us said: “Wow, these are brilliant ideas. Why shouldn’t I try to find some growth hacks for my product?” It’s great that these successful tactics helped us spread our ‘marketing views’ and understand that we can be innovative with tactics. Also, that we can use our start-up learnings to come up with growth hacking/marketing ideas and implement them.

So, if you’re searching for the answer: ‘What is the main difference between Growth Hacking and Digital Marketing? I will answer it right now so that you don’t have to read the post till the end 🙂

Let’s dive right into this next level, shall we?

I will describe the types of personas I met in my Growth Hacking/Digital Marketing career. There are 3 different marketer personas Bad, Ugly and Good marketer.

Bad Marketer is a persona who knows how to get you reddit and StumbleUpon up votes. You pay that persona around $100-$300 for this service. This persona also hears about some proven Facebook hack and he/she tells you that you will get a lot of likes and shares if you pay for that too ($100 more, because a persona can’t guarantee that Facebook will not ban his/her fake profile). In addition, he/she knows tried and tested growth hacks for every product and is also a member of black hat SEO forums, where he/she found 80% of his/her ideas (other 10% are from Facebook groups, 10% are from growth case studies from growthhackers.com).

Bad Marketers are good if you have copied someone’s product or you are trying to build the next social network for the masses and you don’t have a budget (you borrowed it from your dad because you didn’t pass mom’s test). That said, you can hire them to try to hit the masses with hacks and bring them to your Weebly/Unbounce landing page so that you can put in your pitch deck that you had 1300 visitors last week and 17 people left you their email address, and your product can be great if you bring 13,000,000 visitors with $30k.

Having this person as a part of the marketing team is good because they will always have some crazy ideas that’ll refresh the team. However, their presence can be detrimental if they overdo it because other marketers in the team can become crazy too, not the mention the fact that this isn’t documented as a valid experiment.

Ugly Marketer is a persona who knows a lot about Marketing channels and has considerable experience in Google Adwords, Facebook Ads, Ad networks, Social Media, email marketing and other classic marketing channels (They are expensive because they can earn a lot of money by working as freelancers and probably have experience as freelancers, so they can handle good and bad moments very well).

This type of  marketer already knows what works the best and how to quickly optimize all the campaigns. This persona can manage 10 or more campaigns without any pressure. Ugly Marketer is focused on doing “the acquisition job” and leaving the office at 5pm.

Moreover, this persona has got great ad texts and headlines up his/her sleeves that might make you think he/she has mastered sales. He/she knows how “big players” play the game and what their content is. Ugly marketers know how to educate interns who have just finished their master studies by analyzing the changes Google has made in the last two years. This persona is great if you have a huge budget and a clear strategy on how you want to spend it. Furthermore, Ugly Marketer is good if you want to hire people who have a degree in Marketing and want to have a good mentor.

However, these types of personas are bad if you want to know what really happened at a particular moment and why.

Good Marketer is a persona driven by a good structure of data and metrics. This kind of persona first thinks about how the data can be structured and how to cover every part of the funnel (‘Funnel’ is the word they use every morning, afternoon and evening). When they learn about the funnel, they mix their development knowledge with analytical thinking and use it to think about  consumer psychology on every step of the funnel. Good Marketer needs some time to research the product and analyze data from the metrics they have so that they can create a to-do list for the marketing team.

This kind of persona documents everything, and you will find a lot of reports and experiments in his/her Google Drive. They are in love with data and live in metrics. They satisfy their need for creativity by creating A/B experiments and exploring the data in order to find new growth opportunities.

Good Marketers are focused on quality in the marketing strategy through product improvements and iterations. This persona is great for your product if the CEO/founder already knows who the persona is and if the product has a social proof (yes, this means that you did the careful work of Customer Development and already built your MVP). Good Marketer is good if you want to have structured data and you feel that you are ready for massive success. This persona is dangerous if you don’t have a collaborative development team who can set up advanced analytics and implement product changes quickly, and if you don’t plan on having a great data structure behind your product.

These types of marketers helped us understand the mindset of people who call themselves Growth Hackers and Digital Marketing Specialists.

As Gagan Biyani said: “A growth hacker really is just a marketer, but one with a different set of challenges to tackle and tools to work with.” (via TheNextWeb) For him, the main difference is that Growth Hacking is a start-up thing because startups are looking for “hockey-stick” growth. They simply don’t have budgets like huge companies. On the other hand, Digital Marketing is for big companies, because they have to make sure their brands remain at high levels and because they need to acquire new generations of consumers.

It is evident that Digital Marketing Specialists are becoming Growth Hackers because Growth Hacking became a term for all startup marketing activities (standard and non-standard tactics). By startup marketing activities, we refer not only to acquisition marketing channels but also to processes and growth machines startups are implementing in order to improve their tactics and metrics.
