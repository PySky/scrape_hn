Designed to provide twice the full body coverage as our standard v5 system. This PEMF device is strong enough to split each channel into total of 4 magnets ( v5Equine for horses & camels ). The most powerful, full featured EarthPulse™ yet (30% more Gauss per magnet than our v4.7).

Earthpulse™ v5Pro PEMF device is the most powerful PEMF machine under $10,000. Earthpulse™ v5Pro Controller with 2 output jacks & 2 electromagnets (650+ Gauss across the square wave per magnet / 1100 Gauss nano-second peak per magnet); 100 – 240 volt AC to 12 volt DC power supply, local pin adapter; padded clear side v5Pro travel case.

v5Pro; our two magnet PEMF therapy device. The most powerful PEMF device under $10,000 is the pinnacle of 14 years of R&D. It is the most powerful and full featured system we've ever designed. 1/3rd the price of most Mat PEMF systems yet FAR more powerful. More in tune with natural terrestrial frequency range than any other system on Earth. Our patented sleep programs in this full power, full body PEMF device can travel with you in your briefcase or hand bag!

RECOVER-MODE – Up to 12 hours 9.6 Hz with wake up phase and 1 extra hour Alert 14.1 Hz buffer whether set for 8 hour or 12 hours. Perfect for power naps.

SLEEPEZ – 9.6 Hz for 10 Minutes (when set for 8 hours) then stepping down to 3 Hz in 60 seconds then stepping down further to  to 1 Hz over course of during following 15 Hz – back up to 3 Hz for total of 4 cycles then wake up phase and 1 hour 14.1 Hz buffer

SLEEP-MODE 1 –  9.6 Hz stepping down to 1 Hz over 45 minutes (when set for 8 hours) then back to 5 Hz stepping down to 1 Hz – back to 5 Hz for total of 4 cycles then wake up phase and 1 hour 14.1 Hz buffer to help user to wake.

SLEEP-MODE 2 –  9.6 Hz stepping down to 1 Hz over course of 45 minutes (when set for 8 hours) then stepping back up to 3 Hz / down to 1 Hz / back to 3 Hz for total of 4 cycles then wake up phase and 1 hour 14.1 Hz buffer.

SLEEP-MODE 3 – 3 Hz stepping down to 1 Hz back to 3 Hz for total of 4 cycles then wake up phase and 1 hour 14.1 Hz buffer.

SLEEP-MODE 4 – 1 HZ start to finish plus 1 hour 14.1 Hz buffer to help you wake without feeling groggy.

ALERT-MODE – 12 Hz to 14.1 Hz back down to 12 Hz for up to 12 hours (hour choice as a cancelling field for EMF protection during waking hours) MANUAL-FREQUENCY-MODE – Set for 1/2 hz – 14.1 Hz for up to 12 hours with an additional 1 hour 14.1 Hz buffer to help you awaken when used for sleep ENTRAINMENT-UP – 9.6 Hz to 1/2 Hz back up to 14.1 Hz in 30 – 60 minutes setting then shuts off. ENTRAINMENT-DOWN – 9.6 hz to 1/2 Hz and shuts down. 1 hour setting only.
