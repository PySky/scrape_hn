A lot of people just starting out on their fitness journey ask the same question, how often should I work out to get the best results? The answer to this is different depending on what you want to achieve. If you are only going to the gym 1 - 2 times per week, then you really aren't doing anything, except for maintaining your current physique. If you aren't happy with your current physique, you need to bump up those numbers.

To achieve the best results, you should be going to the gym 3-5 times per week. Especially if you are just starting out. There are a few common goals such as cutting, bulking, and strength training. Each one having it's own

When it comes to cutting / burning fat the optimal amount of time that should be spent working out is 3 - 4 times per week. When you are cutting you need to perform total body workouts along with compound movements. This uses a lot of energy which leads to burning fat. It's wise to leave a day in between training sessions for rest, if you want to workout you can perform LISS.

When it comes to bulking up the optimal amount of time spent in the gym should be right at 4 - 5 times per week. Most people will perform one body area per day. For example:

As you can see the schedule for bulking requires more days per week, but each day you are training you are focusing on one group of muscles for maximum muscle growth.

When you are training for strength you should be focusing on three major movements, bench press, dead lifts, and squats. These are knows as the BIG 3. For building strength it is recommended to workout 4 times per week, this allows one day for isolation exercises. Remember that recovery time is crucial for strength training.
