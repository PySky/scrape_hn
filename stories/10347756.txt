Compared to the other porn blockers available, this one does a better job of blocking only bad sites! (The others have been blocking a lot of 100% clean sites that I use daily such as google, etc)



One request: Please add an override feature (a "whitelist?"), as the online portal for my university is blocked by this app, so I have to turn the porn blocker off many times a day to access my school's website. I prefer to have porn blocking on as often as possible, so that I don't run into something unsavory. Allowing us to whitelist sites would let me keep porn blocker on all the time.



(For those using it to keep their kids safe, the whitelist could perhaps be kept behind a password, so whitelisting isn't accessible to kids when a brief moment of temptation comes... although anyone can go into settings and turn the content blocker off anyways... For that reason I think right now content blockers are mainly a way for those who WANT to stay safe, to keep themselves safe.)|||
