Trade site CRN reports Apple has decided not to renew an enterprise licensing agreement (ELA) that covers VMware's (VMW ) vSphere server virtualization platform, and is opting for the rival/open-source KVM platform.

Apple is also reportedly evaluating the open-source OpenStack cloud infrastructure platform, which (though supported by VMware) competes with VMware's vCloud.

With an Apple ELA extension reportedly worth ~$20M to VMware, the deal's direct financial impact is limited for a company with a 2015 revenue consensus of $6.65B. However, Apple would amount to a high-profile client loss for VMware, and a major reference win for KVM, which is backed by IBM and Red Hat (among others).

CRN reports hearing from several VMware partners their customers "are looking at KVM and OpenStack as a way to lower their VMware licensing costs," while qualifying its remarks by noting the platforms can be tough to deploy. A source: "While most companies don't have the technical chops to ditch VMware and go with KVM, ones with mature IT departments may look at this and reconsider their VMware strategies." In addition to KVM, Xen (backed by Citrix) is an open-source server virtualization solution that has seen healthy uptake.

After following markets higher much of the day, VMware gave back its gains in response to the report, and closed down slightly. ELAs accounted for 39% of the company's Q2 bookings.|||
