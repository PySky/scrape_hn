Denton-based Kubos Corporation announced today that it has closed $1.65M in new funding led by Silicon Valley icon Tim Draper of Draper Associates.

The round brings strong validation to the Kubos team and its platform with the round including new investors Draper Dragon, GGV Capital, Autochrome Ventures, and previous investor, Entrenext Ventures.

Kubos is bringing open source innovation to the satellite industry with its KubOS Linux distribution, flight middleware and a modern SDK for developers. The company is gearing up for a 1.0 release of the KubOS developer SDK in mid-April, which includes command and control (C2), telemetry, in-flight software updates, and more. In the last year, Kubos has signed distribution deals with three nanosatellite manufacturers: Innovative Solutions in Space (ISIS), NanaAvionics, and Pumpkin, Inc.

“Companies like Microsoft and Google have shaped industries with their software, and I’m excited to be backing a company with the same approach,” said Tim Draper, founder and managing partner of Draper Associates.

The round brings the total funding for Kubos to just over $2.4M.

“[Kubos] will use this capital to hire engineers, sign more manufacturer distribution deals, break into more traditional satellite missions, and expand our platform with two new cloud products that will be announced this year,” said Marshall Culpepper, CEO and cofounder of Kubos.
