Why should you f***ing care about this book?

Take company A and B. Both have identical value propositions only that company A has more features than company B. They cost practically the same.

Which one would you pick?

The most obvious straight answer would be to pick Company A. Another thing you must know is that both companies are in the same geographic location, they started roughly at the same time but for some reason Company B outgrew company A by 200% in a year.

So why is this?

Company A chose to focus on 1 target segment while company B chose 5 segments What this resulted was a simplification of the feature set which better addressed the customer segment. Less $s spent on Product Development.

And it focused the marketing strategy. Better conversion Rates.|||
