NOA-libre is an object-oriented lightweight Java wrapper around LibreOffice UNO API, providing higher-level abstraction of many UNO interfaces. It is a fork of Ubion's NOA (Nice Office Access) built around API of OpenOffice.org.

To build NOA-libre, maven-ant-tasks is needed to pull LibreOffice Java artifacts from Maven central repository. Install it into your ant's lib/ directory or adjust ${ant.lib} property in build.xml accordingly to point to maven-ant-tasks location.
