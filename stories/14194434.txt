Today we’re excited to announce our partnership with Dwolla, the bank transfer API platform, to launch a fully tokenized ACH payments integration. This marks a huge step forward in our goal to improve one of the biggest payment networks in the U.S.

Many behaviors and preferences around banking have changed over the past few years, but many security processes have been slower to change with them. Bank-to-bank transactions have only grown in popularity since they first came on the scene in the 1970s — and the need for strong security has only increased, too. While tokenization has become standard in some areas of financial services, like the credit card industry, it’s been slower to become standard practice for ACH.

With this partnership, Dwolla customers won’t need sensitive user information like credentials to ever hit their servers, and we’ll also be able to onboard and authenticate accounts to payments pretty much instantly with our Auth product.

We think collaboration is critical to making payment processes better and more inclusive, which is why we’re so excited about partnering with other leading technology companies in the financial services space like Dwolla. Interested in learning more? Check out our docs and start building here.|||
