The most important milestone of my health journey was getting high blood pressure when I was 26. My doctor showed me a number and said “this is bad, this is good — so get yourself here.” Amazingly direct. It wasn’t like “lose a few pounds or exercise a bit more, yada yada yada, see you in 6 months.” I created Corevity to make health easy to understand, a simple score from 1–100.

With all of that, I totally missed the point — data alone can’t solve health! FACE TO PALM. Health isn’t just about facts. I don’t eat a fast food burger because it’s healthy for me, I eat it in spite of that. In order to change your health you need the facts and your community for support — your family, friends and those random internet people who like every thing you do.

YOU TALKED, WE LISTENED. We are changing Corevity, so get ready! More images, more sharing, more, more, more. Corevity is a health community of beautiful people, images and experiences. It is the place for you to articulate and share your health journey. We know you want to be healthy. #getready

In the meantime, we launched our advocate program, so you can share what you already know, Corevity is LIKE AMAZING. Wait, wait, wait, I am busy over here, take it easy there you silly hippie. DUH! I don’t expect you to do this for peanuts. Sign up, share your unique referral code and earn free stuff like bean to bar dark chocolate and foam rollers to keep those muscles sexy, smooth and relaxed. OH YEAH.
