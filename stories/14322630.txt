Kenya's leading telecommunications services provider, Safaricom, has launched two new alternative methods by which customers can make M-Pesa payments, namely, using the new Lipa Na M-Pesa card or the NFC enabled wristband. Both the card, which is also NFC enabled, and the wristband form part of the company's M-Pesa One Tap offering.

The announcement comes after Safaricom has been running a pilot in Nakuru for 6 months testing both the card and the wristband.

“As the M-PESA ecosystem continues to expand, we continue to test the boundaries of the service to identify how we can continue to extend the gains of the platform to an increasing number of customers and businesses,” said Bob Collymore, CEO, Safaricom.

Both the card and the wristband are linked to a customer's existing M-Pesa account with Safaricom saying they are also targeting to roll-out the NFC enabled POS (Point Of Sale) devices to 500,000 merchants accross Kenya.

Safaricom continues to dominate in Kenya as far as mobile money is concerned, with Equitel a distant second place handling only about 20% of mobile money transactions in Kenya according to a report by the Communications Authority of Kenya.|||
