It is intentionally simple and leaves a lot of stuff out. It is a single C file of roughly 500 lines including comments showing the core features of the Linux used to build containers. It includes also the creation of a container from an image to clarify how images and containers are related.

This is a educational piece of software and has not been tested on many systems, here are the prerequisites:

Apart from overlayfs most of the distros are prepared and ready, if not please consult your distro package manager. Overlayfs is in the mainline kernel so it should be straightforward.

Note: Kernel needs to be configured to support following namespaces PID, mount, network and UTS, cgroups are needed as well. Most of the GNU/Linux distros have this support enabled by default.

It creates the necessary directory structure as well as prepares the networking part like iptables rules, bridge (diyc0) and so on. To remove the networking bits like bridge and iptables rules run which removes them all.

It also builds a which executes a local command in namespaces. See to see what namespaces are available. Usage is very simple will start a new bash in new pid, network and UTS namespace.|||
