Google Glass is a type of technology (developed by Google) with an optical head-mounted display which resembles a pair of spectacles with a camera on one side. Glass displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format. Wearers communicate with the Internet and the device via natural language voice commands.

Wearers can tell Glass to do lots of things like search Google, take a photo, record a video, get travel directions, send a message, make a phone all and start a video call over a Google+ Hangout. All wearers have to do is say the words "OK glass" and then say a voice action .

* The table below is ballpark, approximate data just to give an indication of the ways people appear to be using Google Glass and what the voice actions are. The list of phrases at the bottom of the page is not an exhaustive list of searches using Google Glass, as ( similar to Google Now) it's possible to switch on OK Glass, pause and then do a search / voice action.

The below data is from Google Keyword Planner. Based on the numbers we can see below, Glass would appear to be a worldwide failure at time of writing (at least commercially & financially) -  Google stopped selling Glass to individual customers through its Explorer program in early 2015 . To put the data below into context, there are 880 searches monthly globally for the phrase “web design brighton” according to Keyword Planner.|||
