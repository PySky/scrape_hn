Greetings world; we are Anonymous. In response to the UK Government's Digital Economy Bill, which enables imprisonment of content-sharers for up to ten years, we have today taken action against the Intellectual Property Office. Laws such as the one passed today only continue to destroy the idea of a free and open web. It serves as a huge injustice that home-users can be imprisoned alongside rapists and murderers, for the simple act of file sharing. We will continue to fight for net neutrality and a free and open web where ideas and content are freely available to all. As of present, the domain www.ipo.gov.uk has been taken off the internet, and will remain offline until further notice. We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.|||
