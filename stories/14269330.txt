A Geometric Program (GP) is a type of non-linear optimization problem whose objective and constraints have a particular form.

The decision variables must be strictly positive (non-zero, non-negative) quantities. This is a good fit for engineering design equations (which are often constructed to have only positive quantities), but any model with variables of unknown sign (such as forces and velocities without a predefined direction) may be difficult to express in a GP. Such models might be better expressed as Signomials.

More precisely, GP objectives and inequalities are formed out of monomials and posynomials. In the context of GP, a monomial is defined as:

where \(c\) is a positive constant, \(x_{1..n}\) are decision variables, and \(a_{1..n}\) are real exponents. For example, taking \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) to be positive variables, the expressions

are all monomials. Building on this, a posynomial is defined as a sum of monomials:

For example, the expressions

are all posynomials. Alternatively, monomials can be defined as the subset of posynomials having only one term. Using \(f_i\) to represent a monomial and \(g_i\) to represent a posynomial, a GP in standard form is written as:

Boyd et. al. give the following example of a GP in standard form:|||
