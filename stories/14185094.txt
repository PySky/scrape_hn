Back in October 2016, we had high expectations for the redesign of our Gateway infrastructure (originally discussed here).

The lab tests were looking good, and the updated design was solid, but the true test for any software service is how it performs over an extended period of time in production.

Here’s a breakdown of the before & after for design, stats, and interesting info over the last 6 months.

At the end of the day, this change has resulted in a faster, more reliable Gateway services with 100% uptime for our customers. It’s performed as well or better than our expectations and we’re incredibly happy with the outcome.|||
