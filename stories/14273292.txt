Google doesn't need to compete on price to beat rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud computing business, a top executive told CNBC, amid concerns that there could be a pricing war as technology firms get aggressive to acquire customers.

In a phone interview earlier this week, Tariq Shaukat, president of customers at Google Cloud, said that the company's pricing structure, which allows businesses to pay per minute of usage, is unique.

"We don't need to compete on price to be honest. We definitely compete on value more than price â€¦ but if you look at the products, (they) are hard to compare side by side," Shaukat told CNBC.

"We believe that our pricing models are much more friendly. So just simply by adopting the more flexible pricing models we have, things like billing by the minute rather than the hour, we think we can save a typical company 20 to 30 percent without having a unit price different to the competition."|||

Google Cloud executive Tariq Shaukat said the company's expertise in machine learning and AI is a big advantage.
