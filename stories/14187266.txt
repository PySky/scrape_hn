A small envelope of Thylacine hairs found in a cabinet of microscope slides and other samples could lead to proof that Tasmanian tigers are still living- at least that's the hope held by the owner of the hairs, Chris Rehberg.

Chris is a photographer and amateur naturalist with a keen interest in the Tasmanian tiger, he spoke to the ABC Radio Hobart, Your Afternoon Presenter Helen Shield.

The last Tasmanian tigers died in captivity in 1936 and Chris acknowledges that the chances of a tiger being found in the wild is slim.

Chris is fundraising in order to collate accurate and high quality photographs online so that people who come across habitats in caves can compare the thylacine hairs with new specimens.|||

Sydney photographer and amateur naturalist, Chris Rehberg believes that Tasmanian tigers could still be hiding in remote pockets of Tasmania's wilderness and he has the hairs to prove it.
