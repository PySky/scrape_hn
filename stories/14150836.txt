The Latin American Free Software Installation Festival (FLISoL, in Spanish “Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre”) is the biggest event for the dissemination of Free Software in Latin America.

It has been carried out since 2005 and it has 2 primarily objectives:

To that end, various communities of free software (in each country in each city / locality), simultaneously organized events where is installed, free of charge and completely legal, free software in computers that carry the audience. Furthermore, in parallel, will offer lectures, presentations and workshops on topics of local, national and Latin American Free Software works, across their range of expression: artistic, academic, business and social.

In its first edition, it was carried at 106 cities, within 13 countries. In 2014, almost 300 cities across 20 countries confirmed that FLISoL was carried out. This year there are 18 countries confirmed and 300 cities, you can check the countries in the wiki for this year, and that’s why is called the greatest event in Latin Amreica. The date of the event is set to the 4th Saturday of April every year, so this year it will be on April 22nd.

This event has been a great impulse in Latin America to attract, not only users but contributors to all kind of projects, including Fedora Project of course. This year we have confirmed presence in 7 countries within 12 cities, making installations, talks, demonstrations and a lot of fun activities:
