Taking pictures of landmarks and sites can be difficult, the more popular the location the more likely it is that people, vehicles, and other objects will get in the way obstructing your view. “Monument Mode” uses a new algorithm to distinguish moving objects from fixed ones, one-click and those obstructions are gone for good. This early technology preview presented by Ashutosh Jagdish Sharma isn't available in the Creative Cloud yet but share your thougts about it on social using #MonumentMode and let the developers know what you think. Also, the hose of our Sneaks program this year was Nick Offerman (!), who was hilarious but some of his humor isn't for the faint of heart. For Mature audiences only.
