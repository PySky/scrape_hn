A malicious breast augmentation comparison email scam has been caught by MailShark spam filters. The email targets women interested in breast surgery and prompts you to click through to a website to view options however, be warned you will be at risk of a malware infection if doing so. It doesn’t appear to be branded to fit a specific company. Delete this email if it ends up in your inbox.

Figure A shows the email in question. It is quite well branded to attract the reader’s attention. The big yellow button (and the image as a whole) is an attempt to get you to click through to the dangerous website. Even the unsubscribe links are malicious, so we suggest deleting the email straight away. The subject line on this one reads “Comparison Options for Breast Augmentation” while the sender is shown as “Breast Augmentations”, however the sender email address is in no way related to the advert and is clearly spam. Do not click anywhere within this email!

Figure B is a safely captured screenshot of the malicious website these links lead to. It is again quite well branded and matches the email’s contents. It has relevant content and could easily convince a reader that it is legitimate – don’t be fooled. Entering your zip code or clicking anywhere on this webpage can lead to your personal information being stolen or possible malware infection on your PC or device.

The best way to stay safe when receiving emails of this nature is to delete any trace of them from your inbox. If you don’t know why you got the email or who the sender is, it is most likely spam. Delete this email and keep an eye out for similar scam attempts reaching your inbox in the future.
