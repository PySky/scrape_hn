Hey Folks! This is my first presentation about Data Analytics & Online Research, that I put on Youtube. It was a live stream and I edited it a bit. It's very hands-on, easy-to-understand and comes with many real-life examples. If you are looking for doing a better online business by using data - strategically - I recommend to watch.



Otherwise, this was only the second time, I spoke in English in front of this many people. Sorry for the some times broken English - it comes from me being nervous on stage. ;-) Hope you will find it very useful regardless!



I left the Q&A session there as well, as there were many interesting questions.

BRIEF:

During my recent 6 years in online data analysis I have found that one of the most important things is to be strategical about how you research/analyze your data. I’ll show you the Online Research Framework I am using on every research projects I do. The presentation comes with many real life examples and with a case study, I have never presented before.
