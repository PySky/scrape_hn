Package sqlite is an in-process implementation of a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. (Work In Progress)

To access a Sqlite database do something like

This is an experimental, pre-alpha, technology preview package. Performance is not (yet) a priority. When this virtual machine approach, hopefully, reaches a reasonable level of completeness and correctness, the plan is to eventually mechanically translate the IR form, produced by http://github.com/cznic/ccir, to Go. Unreadable Go, presumably.

See http://github.com/cznic/ccir. To add a newly supported os/arch combination to this package try running 'go generate'.

Open returns a new connection to the database. The name is a string in a driver-specific format.

Open may return a cached connection (one previously closed), but doing so is unnecessary; the sql package maintains a pool of idle connections for efficient re-use.

The returned connection is only used by one goroutine at a time.|||
