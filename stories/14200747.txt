From the horrible Hollywood hacks of 2014 to John Podesta's emails, hackers aren't feverishly trying to sneak into your computer. They're coming up with better ways to convince you to let them in. So Sarah Jeong invited a hacker in to see exactly how it's done.

Compromising someone’s digital security is time-consuming, though not for the reasons pop culture might suggest. Hacking isn’t a matter of typing furiously into a cyberpunk-y computer terminal like in The Matrix (although Quintin did indeed spend much of our session typing into an old-fashioned command-line interface). What he needed was time to skulk through my social-media profiles to figure out who I was, who my friends were, where I worked, who I worked with, who I was close to, who I would trust—the kind of information, thanks to social media, that's available to anyone who wants to look. This is the key difference between spearphishing and regular ol’ phishing. Spearphishing involves a component of social engineering: It's the most boring kind of hacking, but also the most dangerous.

Capture the Flag, in this context, is a treasure hunt with oddly sinister overtones and a lot less walking around. In 2016’s contest, players were given a list of target companies three weeks in advance, and they could use that time to collect as much openly available information about the companies as possible. Then, at the Capture the Flag competition, each competitor was placed in a soundproof booth for 25 minutes, during which he or she could make as many phone calls as possible to employees at the target companies. The goal was to gather as many “flags”—a.k.a., pieces of information, like “Is IT support handled in-house?” or “What operating system is in use?” or even “Do you have a cafeteria?”|||
