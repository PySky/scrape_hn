This is our first official major release. Read about our new release process and how we are updating the workflow to formally follow semantic versioning.

We’ve made a couple of changes to our npm configuration: - We’ve upgraded to a “production” dependency, which should solve the problem of missing dependencies for some user installations. - Our now references the static “tarball” version of our release rather than the git endpoint, which means that you can without access to git.

The following are changes to our build tools and process that have no direct impact on the code itself: - The , , and markdown documents are now included in our static and npm distributions. - Use stylelint to ensure that our SCSS files meet our own guidelines. - Measure JavaScript code coverage with istanbul and analyze coverage with code climate. - Commits (merges) to master are now automatically published to via our CI service.

We recommend upgrading to v0.13.3 of the Standards. If you are unable to do so, please use the attached uswds-0.13.2patch.css (un-minified) or uswds-0.13.2patch.min.css (minified) and uswds-0.13.2patch.map files on this release.

We are planning to make the following changes to the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards in future releases. In keeping will semantic versioning conventions, we will never intentionally introduce breaking changes without updating the minor and major versions accordingly. Here are the upcoming changes: 1. The Standards will no longer require jQuery or include it as part of the package you download. If you are using jQuery for other parts of your site, you will have to download it separately. It won’t come included in the Standards any more. We decided to make this change because we heard from our users that requiring jQuery for the WDS conflicted with other versions of jQuery they were already using. 2. We have reorganized some of our SCSS “partials”, and will be removing the deprecated paths in a future release. If you import the USWDS into your own Sass or SCSS files, here is what you need to know: - We have replaced the SCSS “entry point” with , and set up an alias for ( ) to ease the transition for users of previous versions. Upgrade instructions: - replace with , or - replace to - We have deprecated the SCSS partial in favor of , and added to all of our variables so that they can be selectively overridden by a previous import. Upgrade instructions: - remove or - add if you don’t import it already - move your variable customizations before for consistency - remove any unmodified variable declarations from your customizations to avoid accidentally overriding future changes - is no longer necessary, as the grid settings are all declared in . Upgrade instructions: - remove or

This release includes the addition of two different page templates and government verification banners.

In the near future, the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards will no longer include jQuery as part of its package. Users will be required to include when using the Standards. If you have questions about this upcoming change, please email our team at uswebdesignstandards@gsa.gov.

This is a patch level release that adds missing images for the mobile version of the new headers component into the directory. In version 0.12.0 they were added as part of the website/docs assets and not part of the package itself. Please use v0.12.1 in place of v0.12.0!

Updated to 0.12.1: Release 0.12.0 was missing some images for the new Headers component. You may run into issues using 0.12.0 on your project.

Please use version 0.12.1 in place of 0.12.0!

This release includes the addition of a headers component, which helps users identify where they are and provides them a quick, organized way to reach the main sections of a website. Check out our documentation to learn more about our most recently added component.

In this release, we’ve refactored the accordion code so that it is easier to use, less specific, and more concise. The accordion functionality from previous releases will still work and there are instructions on how to make the upgrade when it best suits the needs of your project.

We have been made aware that we didn’t explicitly outline a backwards-incompatible change for the accordion component in , and we’d like to apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you or your team. In the release notes for , we’ve added directions on how to update your accordions with these changes when you make this upgrade.

In this release, we’ve made a specific backwards-incompatible change to the the structure of the files. Prior to this release, users could update their project specific variables by changing the values in . This release removes that file and from the core import and will require users to manually add their application-specific Sass files.

In this release, there is a specific backwards incompatible change to the accordion component. Users will need to update their HTML to remove the and attributes from accordion panels that aren’t expanded by default. This makes the content of these panels accessible without JS. This change was introduced here.

This version introduces several backwards-incompatibility changes that will affect usage of the Standards. Here are a few things to note as you upgrade to version 0.9.0.

The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards website is no longer hosted at the root level of the directory — it’s now hosted from /docs. The zip file for the is no longer located in the Standards repository. You can now find it on our GitHub releases page.

This version of the Standards has an updated folder structure, which includes several new areas that assist automation of the workflow.

This updated folder structure features , , , and directories at the root level of the repository. Here’s an overview of the items you’ll find in each of these directories:

This folder contains the compiled CSS and bundled JavaScript files, along with image and font files that are distributed to our users. These are the only files you need to start using the Standards in your own project.

This folder contains a gulp folder with all the configurations necessary for running various gulp tasks if you want to build the Standards yourself.

This folder contains all of the source files you’ll need to use before you compile the Standards that are used prior to compilation of the Standards. None of these files are minified, by any means, and they’re what you should use when you make contributions to the source files themselves.

This folder contains the Jekyll site that generates the Standards website.

If you’d like to move beyond working with the code and components included in our ZIP file and work with the files used to generate the Standards website, you can build out everything using gulp or npm.

The Draft Web Design Standards package (the ZIP download and the files needed to use the Standards on your project) and style guide website (our public site that displays examples of each component and the HTML code) are built using gulp. To use gulp, first make sure you’ve installed it on your machine globally. For more information on installing gulp, check out this document. Check out our file to learn more about how to use the new gulp workflow.

You can now install the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards using npm. Check out our file to learn more about how to install using this new method and how to implement the Standards into in your project.
