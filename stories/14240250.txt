NEW YORK—There has been much to see at this year's New York International Auto Show. Ford had a new hybrid police car. Cadillac brought its new race car—unbeaten in 2017—and a new semi-autonomous system that uses head-tracking to know if the driver is paying attention. Range Rover added a fourth SUV to its line-up, and Genesis showed us a rather attractive fuel cell concept. And Honda is finally bringing a proper Civic Type R to these shores. Elsewhere in our coverage we chose our picks of the show, but there were a few more vehicles that caught our eye after two days of walking the floors of the Javits Center.

Mercedes-AMG was also feeling the need to display some powerful V8 metal. It's shoehorned its 4.0L twin-turbo V8 into the GLC SUV and coupe. The pick of these would be the GLC63 S Coupe, with 505hp (376kW), a new nine-speed automatic transmission, and torque-vectoring all-wheel drive. Knowing AMG's reputation, we bet nothing else on the school run would sound like it.

There was yet another GT-R from Nissan, and a hybrid Panamera Turbo from Porsche. If those don't push your performance button, how about Bugatti's new Chiron? The new Bugatti has have stupendous performance, its top speed still unknown but electronically limited to 261mph (400km/h).

For those who consider the idea of a massive 16-cylinder, 8.0L, 1,479hp (1,103kW) engine socially unacceptable in 2017, take a look at the Rimac Concept_One. Rimac is the Croatian company behind some very clever electric powertrains, including the Pikes Peak hill climb car we went to see in 2016.

Check out all of those, and more, in the gallery and video above.|||
