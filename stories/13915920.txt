Borg was built out of the frustration of having to leave the terminal to search and click around for bash snippets. Glance over multiple snippets quickly with Borg's succinct output.

(1) Bash: How to list only files [a] find -maxdepth 1 -type f [b] ls -l egrep -v ls -l grep -v (2) List only common parent directories files [a] read a line into the variable "prefix", split at slashes IFS=/ -a prefix while there are more lines, one after another read them into "next", IFS=/ -a next new_prefix=() for all indexes in prefix if the word in the new line matches the old one [[ ]] ...

Use to pipe the results straight to (or another program).

Can't find what you are looking for? Be a good hacker and contribute your wisdom to the hive mind by tweaking existing snippets and adding your own.

The following releases only let you search snippets. To add or edit snippets, install from source. Releases are coming soon.

When a result works for you, use the command to give feedback:

This will rank the result higher for similar queriesâ€”especially helpful when a good result was buried in the search results.

For more commands and their explanations, please see advanced usage.

The client connects to a server at ok-b.org. You can host your own server too (see daemon folder), though self-hosting will become less appealing once people start contributing their own content to the database.
