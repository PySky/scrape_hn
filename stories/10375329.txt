This project aims to illustrate the wide range of energy densities of common sources of power. All energy density figures are approximate.

Here's how the iPhone 6s energy density figure was calculated:

Most of the other energy density values were taken from Isidor Buchmann's informative Battery University site. The energy density value for alkaline batteries came from this MIT battery primer presentation. You can download the data used for this project here.

The volume of the entire battery module is used in this calculation.

This project assumes 15 hours for "regular use" of the iPhone 6s. Your mileage may vary. Check out our iPhone 6s review.

Natural gas energy density value is for a pressure of 250 bars.

Please do not try to power your iPhone with natural gas, diesel or body fat.|||

Gas? Coal? Body fat? Compared to the world's other popular energy sources, lithium-ion batteries have a long way to go.
