Advancements in artificial intelligence are changing how we analyze and process information. But these advances fall short when compared with the ingenuity and creativity of an average three-year old. In his talk, psychologist and neuroscientist Gary Marcus compares advancements in AI to the resilience of the human brain on tasks such as common sense and real-time evaluations. 



"Gary F. Marcus wants to build a human mind from scratch. His research at New York University combines psychology, linguistics, and molecular biology to map the inner workings of the brain and deconstruct common sense scientifically.

“No modern machine can match the ingenuity of any three-year-old,” Marcus said. “A deep understanding of the human mind will radically transform society.”

In addition to teaching, Marcus is a best-selling author and founder of the company Geometric Intelligence, which is redefining the boundaries of machine learning. By applying a deep understanding of the human mind to artificial intelligence, Marcus hopes to revolutionize the capabilities of modern technology and radically transform society."
