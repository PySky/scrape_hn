This is an ongoing development. If you are looking for the Coq sources corresponding to specific papers, take a look here.

The CH O project aims at formalizing novel features of the ISO C11 standard of the C programming language. CH O provides an operational, executable, and axiomatic semantics for a significant fragment of C11.

Our recent paper A Typed C11 Semantics for Interactive Theorem Proving at CPP 2015 gives a good overview of the CH O project.

The most recent version of the Coq source code of this development can be downloaded here. Use:

to compile the development. This yields an executable called that can be used to test the CH O semantics against actual C source files.|||
