DB Bot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to construct DB queries. What that means is you can interact with your database like you're talking to a human

 Here's an example

It's rather basic at the moment but I'm working on incorporating more complex database queries.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

Or install it yourself as:

The only thing you'll need to do after installing is add our Wit.ai access token. This gives you access to all the language rules. You can view our project here https://wit.ai/dawilster/db_bot.

Then you can jump in and asks questions like.

.message( How many users signed up last week? ) .message( ) .message( How many sales does the item with id 103 have? ) (coming soon)
