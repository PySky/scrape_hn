The question of what, exactly, narwhals use their tusks for has long puzzled scientists, generating plenty of theories but not a lot of hard facts.

Now, new footage released by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the World Wildlife Fund proves that the whales– sometimes called ‘unicorns of the sea’ – do, indeed, use them to hunt.

The video was captured by documentary filmmaker Adam Ravetch using drones based out of a DFO arctic research camp, and shows the narwhals feeding on a school of cod.

However, the way they use the tusks might not be quite what you’re imagining.

“As the cod was positioned close to the tip of the tusk, the narwhal then sort of gave it a quick hard tap that likely stunned the fish, it looked like it was momentarily not moving, and then the narwhal would move in with its mouth and suck in the prey,” says DFO biologist Steve Ferguson in a video uploaded Friday.|||
