Visual Studio 2017 is now available and I created this unofficial GitHub repo to help developers find various related downloads, documentation and learning resources such as videos or blogs related to this milestone.

A list of blog posts from both the Visual Studio 2017 March launch event and related posts that were released in the lead-up to the RTM release.

Please note that Visual Studio 2017 is referenced as "Dev15" or Visual Studio "15" in older blog post before we announced the final product naming at the launch event|||
