Firefox was about to arrive one of the most interesting features we have seen in the browser in a good time. And, those who are encouraged to try it ( ) using the Firefox Test Pilot can already discover its advantages.

This is the experiment Containers, a new function that allows you to create containers to organize groups of tabs.

It’s basically the same as alternative browsers like Ghost Browser, and they let you have different sessions per tab to use multiple accounts from the same site at a time.

The purpose of these containers is to create different profiles of Firefox for our diverse varieties of activities online.

For example, we can create a work container in which we open the Twitter account of the company where we work and a personal container where we open our own profile.

The advantage is to do everything in one window, in the same browser and without having to log out at any time, since each container is completely isolated from the other.

The containers also store the cookies separately, this is an advantage of privacy, because the crawlers can not establish a relationship between the navigation of one container and another.

By default, there are already four categories of preset containers, but you can modify them to your liking, create new ones, organize them, edit them or delete them. You can add colors and icons to differentiate them better.

To select a container you only have to move the mouse pointer by the new tab button. Next, to the address bar, the container label will always appear, so you know where you are opening a page. And under each tab is a line of the color that identifies it.

From the same menu, you can also hide all the tabs in a container or open them in a new window. And, you have the “sort containers” button to organize containers in a click.|||
