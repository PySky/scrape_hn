The cars are full of mini cameras, which allow police to disable them once they have been stolen.

 The RAC says vehicle baits are being used in countries including United States to catch car thieves.

"Once they are in the car, the doors automatically lock and the vehicle's under surveillance by the police," RAC spokesman Glen Walker said.

 "There is overwhelming case law on this in Australia and indeed world-wide that says it's not necessarily entrapment and let's face it if you are not going to steal a motor vehicle you have nothing to worry about at all."

RAC has a plan to catch all the car thieves and started to bait the cars, allowing is one of the more radical ways police in the US and Canada are tackling car theft.

 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported a 16 per cent drop in the number of cars stolen between 2007 and 2008 in British Columbia, with the result largely attributed to the bait car program.|||
