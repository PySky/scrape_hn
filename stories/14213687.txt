This fork is being used for https://github.com/hackerfleet/hfos We'll try to maintain upstream but will add certain features for the circuits framework, which we also use: https://bitbucket.org/circuits/circuits

This is a package for generating classes from a JSON-schema that are to be saved in MongoDB and (un)pickled via Python's builtin json module or others like simplejson or ujson.

The Hackerfleet uses warmongo as ORM system to deal with data objects in a developer and enduser friendly way. See it in action on http://github.com/hackerfleet/hfos

The original author uses warmongo every day at his startup http://www.sweetiq.com/ to share data definitions between their Python and Node.js applications. It has been running in production for some time now, so it has been reasonably tested for robustness and performance.|||
