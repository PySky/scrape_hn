We understand the complexity of code and policy as the most fundamental security problem shared by modern general-purpose operating systems. Because of high functional demands and dynamic workloads, however, this complexity cannot be avoided. But it can be organized. Genode is a novel OS architecture that is able to master complexity by applying a strict organizational structure to all software components including device drivers, system services, and applications. The Genode OS framework is the effort to advance the Genode OS architecture as a community-driven Open-Source project. The book "Genode Foundations" describes the Genode OS Framework in a holistic and comprehensive way. It equips the reader with a thorough understanding of the architecture, assists developers with the explanation of the development environment and system configuration, and provides a look under the hood of the framework. Furthermore, it contains the specification of the framework's programming interface. Download the book as PDF Genode will participate under the umbrella of the FOSDEM microkernel devroom as mentoring organization in this year's Google Summer of Code program. By introducing application binary interfaces, version 17.02 cultivates the cross-kernel binary compatibility of components. Furthermore, the new version comes with a vastly improved VFS infrastructure, new input-event processing capabilities, and a dynamic component-composition engine. With the upcoming version 17.02, Genode will adopt the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3) as its regular open-source license. The year 2017 will be overall focused on stressing the scalability and stability of the framework. The microkernel developer room at this year's FOSDEM will host four Genode-related talks, ranging from our custom kernel, over kernel-independent binaries, execution replay, to Genode's VFS infrastructure. Version 16.11 revisits the most fundamental low-level protocols of the framework to further improve its scalability, refines the virtual networking facilities, adds support for smart cards, and improves the NOVA kernel.
