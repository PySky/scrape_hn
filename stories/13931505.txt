AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SailPoint, the leader in identity management, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recognized SailPoint’s innovative approach to empowering enterprise employee and partner populations to manage their network access credentials, even when located remotely and locked out of the corporate network. This new patent award enables SailPoint to uniquely provide a solution that ensures security for the enterprise and ease of use for both remote workers and office-based employees and partners. SailPoint’s patent number 9,600,656, entitled ‘System and Method for Domain Password Reset in a Secured Distributed Network Environment’, is another example of the company’s innovative approach to securing identity data for global enterprises.

Typically, company-issued laptops and other mobile devices don’t allow users to recover from forgotten network passwords while away from the office and disconnected from the company domain servers. This presents a challenge to anyone who works remotely or travels as part of their job responsibilities. Should they happen to forget their network password while disconnected from the corporate network, until now there has been no way to reset the password without employing duplicate local accounts or physically connecting the device to the main company domain server and network. In this situation, remote employees are effectively locked out and must ship their laptop to the company's IT staff so they can reset the password and then ship it back. In the case of the business traveler, they must wait until they return from their business trip to re-attach to the corporate domain server. This all leads to a significant loss in productivity and end-user dissatisfaction.

SailPoint’s patented technology enables remote business users to reset their local and domain password remotely without having to involve IT. This processes leverages SailPoint’s newly patented technology, and the SailPoint open identity platform, to create a seamless, secure and convenient end to end solution. Once reset, the user's password is automatically updated across the connected windows domain, eliminating any need for physical connectivity or the arcane shipment of hardware.

“Companies of all sizes need to ensure the security of remote workers without sacrificing productivity and ease of use,” said Darran Rolls, CTO of SailPoint. “This patented technology illustrates our continued focus on infusing innovation into our open identity platform to solve real-world issues that our customers face today. With this capability, when a remote worker needs to reset their password and they cannot connect to the corporate network, we can provide a simple convenient self-service solution that does require direct It involvement. This means cost savings, improved productivity and a better end-user experience.”

This new patent complements SailPoint’s existing patent portfolio which includes a “System and Method for Securing Authentication Information in a Networked Environment,” highlighting the uniquely differentiated way that SailPoint’s SaaS solution, IdentityNow, maintains no knowledge of the administrative credentials used to access enterprise resources located behind the firewall, ensuring that even in the case of a rogue employee in the data center, the customer’s infrastructure will remain secure.
