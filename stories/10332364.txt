The Project Apollo Archive has just uploaded more than 8,400 astonishing, high-resolution images to Flickr from the NASA moon missions and from training operations on Earth. The collection includes original scans from the Hasselblad cameras the astronauts used to document their missions, including some of the most iconic space photos in history.

What’s perhaps more exciting are the thousands of other photos that document minutia from the missions, including hundreds of photos of different aspects of the moon. Many of the photos aren’t technically perfect, but provide an intimacy of the experience that hasn’t been seen before by the wider public. Be sure to check out the many albums grouped together by the film magazines they were shot on.
