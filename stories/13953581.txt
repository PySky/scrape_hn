MiamiJS and Kyle Simpson (aka Getify) writer of the You Don't Know JS series of books, are teaming up to bring you a two-day workshop delving into ES6 and Functional Programming with JavaScript.

You can come to one or both days. Only 35 seats available. Early bird prices available until Mar. 7th.

On the first day, we’ll dig into a bunch of new changes to JavaScript as of ES6 and get a glimpse of a few things on the horizon. The most important takeaway is that ES6 is not about new capabilities but rather new expressivity.

If our goal is to write cleaner, clearer, more understandable code—and it should be—ES6 offers myriad improvements that make our efforts so much more effective.



Armed with our new-found knowledge for writing clean, expressive, declarative ES6+ code, we’ll turn our attention to functional programming (FP).

If statements like “a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors” intimidate or confuse you or if you’re not already steeped in the traditions of formality, notation, and academia that seem to drive most discussions around FP, don’t worry; you’re not alone. Many of us quickly get lost wading through all those terms and symbols. But hidden under all that noise, there’s a wealth of powerful concepts that all programmers can and should be using to bring their code up from merely working to readable and maintainable. I call this approach “Functional-Light JavaScript.”

We’ll walk step by step through each practical FP pattern, staying as far from those crazy functor-like words as we can. We’ll see just how sensible and intuitive many parts of FP really are.

Pizza and drinks will be served for lunch and we'll be right across the street from Bayside Marketplace if you prefer to go grab something else for lunch.

The Metromover stop to get off at is Bayfront Park.|||
