Freeter is a great new app for the Mac / Windows / Linux for simplifying your workflow. It is essentially a dashboard into your projects.

A freeter in Japan is a young person who typically lives at home and works in low paying temporary jobs. As opposed to the salaryman, a freeter lives a life of less stress, moving between jobs and leisure at will. Iâ€™m not sure if this is how this product got its name, but it kinda fits.

When you start Freeter you have a blank dashboard for your projects. Each project can have their own dashboard where you can add:

When developing Colourinz, I used Freeter extensively. Apart from keeping track of to do items and bugs (through You Track by Jet Brains), I used it to fire off scripts to generate screenshots and upload them to the App Store or start a beta build and upload that.

I have several side projects that I use Freeter to pull everything together. I can work on one of these projects and then do nothing for months. Freeter allows me to come back to it and pick up where I left off.

So if you have trouble keeping your side projects on track, you should take a look at Freeter.|||
