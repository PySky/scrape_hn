I am The New Artist.

 I paint with switches and resistors, capacitors and transistors.

 Instead of mixing pigments I combine electrons.

 My paintings do not have color or form,

 but rather signal and function.

Instead of instilling emotions in the viewer, 

 I make the viewer instill digits into memory

 To add purpose to arbitrary bits crashing into each other.|||
