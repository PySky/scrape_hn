Apple quietly made one of its coolest hires ever.

The company recently brought on Steven Keating, the MIT doctoral student who made a 3D printout of his own brain after he was diagnosed with a tumor.

We don't know whether Keating is working on one of Apple's teams dedicated to health care, given his affinity for the space, or whether he has joined another team that would take advantage of his mechanical engineering expertise.

Keating spoke today at Sage Bionetworks' annual conference, Assembly, which brings together patient advocates and researchers to discuss open innovation in science. Keating, who is listed on the agenda as working on Apple, still lists his occupation as a doctoral candidate at MIT Media Lab on his LinkedIn profile. He previously worked as a product design intern at Apple during the summer of 2013.|||
