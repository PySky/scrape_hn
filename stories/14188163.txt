A container registry provides a centralized location from which your applications can pull images to run wherever you need them to run. A private registry lets you keep all or some of the images for your applications accessible only to trusted admins or servers that have credentials to access them.

You configure your Kubernetes cluster to provide these credentials either within a namespace or on a pod-by-pod basis. Within a namespace, you provide credentials by adding them to a Kubernetes service account.

How you configure your cluster depends on which registry you pull from. See the following topics for details:|||
