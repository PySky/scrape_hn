First person shooter Call of Duty, den of vice Grand Theft Auto, adventure fantasy Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

These are just a few of the high-octane industry-leading video games making millions today.

But gaming does have to be action-packed or weapon-wielding: they can be intensely emotional intimate experiences – few know this better than game developer and lecturer Robert Yang.

“I want to explore anxiety and leave players unsatisfied or confused,” said Yang when we first interviewed him.

Today Yang’s students are following in his footsteps, and the New York teacher has shared a series of student work developed to “autobiographical” themes.

These cover all sorts of tender subjects; from being sick on public transport, to having a crush, or feeling miserable in your job.

They push the boundaries of what viewers expect of a game and give deeply personal insights into their creators.

All are published on itch.io, so you can give them a go yourself.
