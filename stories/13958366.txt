This code is based on torch. It has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Compile (Adjust and in for your machine):

To generate all results (in ) using the provided scripts, simply run

in Matlab or Octave and then

in Python. The final output will be in .

You can pass and to both Lua scripts (step 3. and 4.) to potentially improve speed and memory usage. must be in your . This requires cudnn.torch.

Note: In the main paper we generate all comparison results using automatic scene segmentation algorithm modified from DilatedNet. Manual segmentation enables more diverse tasks hence we provide the masks in .

The mask colors we used (you could add more colors in function in two files):

Here are some automatic and manual tools for creating a segmentation mask for a photo image:

Here are some results from our algorithm (from left to right are input, style and our output):
