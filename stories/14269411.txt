Rayton Solar has bridged the gap between particle accelerator technology and solar energy production to create a revolutionary silicon cutting technique. This technique is projected to reduce solar panel manufacturing costs by upwards of 60% compared to industry standards, while making them 25% more efficient, and resulting in a very cost-effective source of energy.

Rayton Solar is a California-based solar panel company that aims to develop the world’s most cost-effective source of energy. By bringing together essential particle accelerator technology and solar energy manufacturing, Rayton has created silicon cutting and handling techniques that can be leveraged to transform the way electricity is generated around the world.

The key to Rayton's cost savings lies in their ability to increase silicon yield with their patent-pending silicon cutting process. Rayton Solar is capable of making up to 100 times as many solar panels with the same amount of silicon as its competitors use to make just one panel.

Rayton’s technique has also unlocked the commercial viability of ultra pure electronic grade silicon – Float Zone Silicon – for use in a solar panel. Silicon is the most expensive component of a solar panel and Float Zone Silicon (FZ) is 10 times as expensive as the market standard Czochralski Process Silicon (CZ). By reducing wafer thickness to 3 microns and eliminating waste - Rayton is able to utilize FZ economically. No other solar manufacturer in history has been able to economically use FZ, which provides Rayton with the potential to produce up to 24% efficient solar panels.

Rayton believes this efficiency increase means that buyers would require 25% less solar panels than they do today. The savings are seen down the entire solar system vertical - including installation, racking, land, and maintenance costs.

The standard industry manufacturing process wastes half the raw silicon block due to the saw blade that is used to cut silicon. Rayton Solar's manufacturing technology is a zero waste process that represents a revolutionary new step for the solar industry.

The global energy market is projected to grow to over $10.4 trillion by the year 2020.

Furthermore, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects renewable energy to be "the largest single source of electricity growth over the next five years."

By 2040, renewables will command 60% of new capacity and 2/3 of power investment globally. As global population surpasses 7.5 billion people, additions to the global sustainable energy portfolio will top 700 GW or 26% of the world's power capacity.

As international economies make a more conscious effort to shape the way we generate energy, the stage is set for renewables to become the primary method of powering the world. Rayton Solar aims to command the sector.

As federal energy requirements mandate an increase in the production of renewable energy (solar, wind, tidal, and others), California has set their renewable portfolio standards to 1/3 of its energy portfolio by 2020.

Rayton Solar is uniquely positioned to be an industry leader as these trends continue across the country and around the world, creating the perfect legislative environment for its growth.
