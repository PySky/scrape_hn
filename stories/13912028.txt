Separate from Apple's recent proposals around WebGPU as a new low-level graphics API for the web , The Khronos Group appears to be readying to solicit ideas for "WebGL Next" as their next-gen web graphics API.Now that WebGL 2.0 is finalized and shipping in the major web browsers, Khronos is already beginning brainstorming for what's next with next-generation graphics APIs for the modern web.As confirmed earlier this month in A Chat With Khronos President Neil Trevett About Vulkan, OpenXR, SPIR-V In 2017 , they aren't pursuing any WebGPU collaboration, at least at this point, with Apple continuing to dance to their own tune.It's been a few weeks since GDC17 when some WebGL-Next chatter began to happen and this week there's now KhronosGroup/WebGLNext-Proposals on GitHub . This Git repository is currently empty but was just created this week under the official Khronos GitHub account by Google's Ken Russell.Following Khronos being much more open when it comes to Vulkan and their collaboration on GitHub along with the opening of some of their conformance test suites, it's great to see them preparing to stage proposals for WebGL-Next in public view on GitHub. When anything lands in WebGLNext-Proposals, you can expect to hear about it on Phoronix.|||
