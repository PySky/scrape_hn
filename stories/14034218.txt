The Django team is happy to announce the release of Django 1.11.

This version has been designated as a long-term support (LTS) release, which means that security and data loss fixes will be applied for at least the next three years. It will also receive fixes for crashing bugs, major functionality bugs in newly-introduced features, and regressions from older versions of Django for the next eight months until December 2017.

As always, the release notes cover the medley of new features in detail, but a few highlights are:

You can get Django 1.11 from our downloads page or from the Python Package Index. The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.

With the release of Django 1.11, Django 1.10 has reached the end of mainstream support. The final minor bugfix release (1.10.7) was issued today. Django 1.10 will receive security and data loss fixes for another eight months until December 2017.

Django 1.9 has reached the end of extended support. The final security release (1.9.13) was issued today. All Django 1.9 users are encouraged to upgrade to Django 1.10 or later.
