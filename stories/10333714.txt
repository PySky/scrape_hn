Last week, Google unveiled a slew of new mobile devices to the world; Nexus 5x and Nexus 6P mobiles and the Pixel C tablet. They join the Chromebook Pixel laptop to complete a bit of a disjointed hardware offerings from Mountain View. On their own, the smartphones represent a refresh of the existing Nexus lines, and the Pixel C is a new addition to the tablet lineup. But what is Google's overall strategy here?

From the mixed reviews across the Web, the Nexus phones represent nothing new over and above Android OEM offerings from , Motorola, LG, and for example. A few offer that this could be the last of the Nexus line, since a smartphone spec war these days is about as exciting as a wet rich tea biscuit, and the only real differentiator is getting hold of a pure version of Android, and updates before anyone else.

The Pixel C takes an entirely new approach to the tablet experience.

But Google sneaked in the Pixel C, and it caused some head scratching.

Here is a new Google branded tablet device, which looks gorgeous, and with a separate keyboard that will have lawyers reaching for their Windows phone. But it runs on Android. Not Chrome OS. What is Google thinking here?

Taking a look at market penetration of Android devices against Windows and iOS it's clear that there's a strong presence from Google. Despite a strong performance from OEMs in 2014,  Chromebook shipments increased by 67% quarter on quarter but only accounted for 5% overall OS market share , so launching a tablet based on this operating system would have killed the new Pixel C straight off the bat.

Interestingly, analysis pitches Android as "the new Windows" as Microsoft's grip on on the desktop market has slipped in recent years.|||

Mountain View needs a cohesive hardware strategy, and it's taken its sweet time in doing so.
