The freeCodeCamp community generates gigabytes of data each week. One of the most active parts of the community is the chat room system. Thousands of people hang out there, chat about technology, and help each other improve their code skills.

I frequently ask questions about the data. This week, I was curious which YouTube videos people found to be the most relevant to their studies. So I analyzed the multi-gigabyte chat history from freeCodeCamp’s main chatroom.

Out of the thousands of YouTube videos mentioned, here are the 12 most-commonly mentioned ones.

This was a presentation by Philip Roberts at JSConf EU in 2014. The event loop is important to how Node.js works.

To explain the event loop, Philip goes through other essential concepts like callbacks, and asynchronous programming. He jams a ton of insight into an enjoyable 26 minute conference talk.

Engineered Truth host Matt Tran interviews freeCodeCamp’s Quincy Larson, asking him for about tips for new coders.

A lot of new coders first heard about freeCodeCamp through this 20-minute video, which has been viewed half a million times.

Another interview Matt Tran conducted with Quincy on the same afternoon — which is also frequently shared in our chat rooms — is Computer science vs Self-taught vs Coding Bootcamp.

In this series of videos, he builds some of freeCodeCamp’s projects. In the chat room the most popular video of that series is freeCodeCamp’s portfolio project.

After recording this, Dylan earned his freeCodeCamp Front End Development certificate and landed a full-time job doing web development.

This 48-minutes talk by Lea Verou comes from O’Reilly's 2012 Fluent Conference.

It’s a good summary of what Regular Expressions are, how they work, where to apply them, some very common errors made by new adopters, and tricks that people tend to forget or ignore.

Video #9 in the FunFunFunction series by Mattias Petter Johansson. Here he talks about the role of semicolons in JavaScript.

This 2-hour-long tutorial uses examples to introduce JavaScript concepts, and how to manipulate the DOM. Derek provides an index in the description of the video so you can jump to specific segments that interest you.

Note that he recorded this in 2015, so it doesn’t include the latest ES6 improvements to JavaScript.

This 13-minute video belongs to O'Reilly’s JavaScript Teasers series. It explains the often confusing JavaScript this keyword.

Note that this was recorded in 2014, and doesn’t include the latest ES6 improvements to JavaScript.

This video frames the first 3.5 hours of a popular course in Udemy taught by Toni Alicea.

The complete course is more than 11 hours of videos, but it’s not free. The course has been known to go for as low as $15 dollars during Udemy’s sales, though.

Chris the Freelancer taught himself web development, then recorded this 8-minute video explaining how he did it.

He encourages people who want to learn on their own to use free platforms, though he says there can sometimes be value in paid courses.

LearnCode.academy created this overview of what they think web developers should learn in 2017.

Stefan Mischook, a seasoned developer, talks about what you need to become an expert web developer.

Eli the Computer Guy discusses why you need to apply to as many jobs as possible — even if you don’t feel qualified.

As a bonus, here are some extremely popular videos that aren’t directly related to learning web development.

Possibly the funniest motivational video ever made. The original video, and its many variants, have been popular in freeCodeCamp’s chat rooms since the video was first published on YouTube.

A parodical lyric with the music of Beatles' "Let it be". The parody seems to have been sung for the first time during the 90's when C started to become the language of preference by computer scientists. Authorship is unknown but a version was brought forward by Albert Veli. Sing along!

Yes, this is one of the most commonly linked-to videos in the chat room.

If you clicked the link, congratulations. You have been Rickrolled.

A presentation by Joe Armstrong, one of the inventors of Erlang, at the Strangeloop Conference in 2014. This video focuses on some of the hardest problems in computer science.

People frequently link to this playlist of some of the nonprofit projects built by freeCodeCamp alumni.|||
