Move from GitHub Pages to Netlify in with just a few commands!

In this post I’ll show you how easy it is to migrate your GitHub page to Netlify. I’ll be using my personal project (github pages & netlify pages) as an example. The project is a simple site that has no build necessary, the markup is all just in the root directory.

These steps assume that you have and installed on your machine already. If you haven’t used the Netlify CLI before, it will open a browser page to login and set the credentials.

The deploy site will ask you some simple questions and then push up the site to your url. Your site is now live!

If you want to setup continuous delivery, every push to your git repo will update your site automatically, it is a single command.

It’s just that easy. Your site is now live on our global CDN and tied in to git. Watch below to see it in action!

Don’t worry if you missed any flags, want to setup a custom domain or do any other number of useful tasks, you can always log in to the app and tweak the settings.

Netlify is an all-in-one platform for deploying and automating modern web projects.

Simply push and Netlify provides everything—servers, CDN, continuous delivery, HTTPS, staging environments, prerendering, asset post processing, DNS, and more.

Any project, big or small, can perform instantly on a global scale.|||
