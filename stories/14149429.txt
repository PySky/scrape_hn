One of my favorite parts of running a startup is seeing the growth and development of our Diplomats (the endearing term for our team at Ambassador). It’s incredibly fulfilling to watch people come in with little (or no) experience and become high-performing leaders inside and outside of the office.

From an employee perspective, much of the allure of joining a startup is upward mobility. You enter as an individual contributor and — if you crush it long enough — may find yourself with a seat at the table. It’s no small feat to move from an individual contributor to a team lead or director. Let alone to a manager or perhaps even a manager of managers.

Remember, startups are not perfect organisms. They are inherently resource constrained, and often times, things appear to be in disarray (If they don’t appear to be in disarray the leadership is great at hiding things). There’s constant tension between speed and improvement. Another constant is change. Startups must focus and prioritize on the most impactful issues then relentlessly execute. If you understand and embrace this you can learn to thrive in this chaos!
