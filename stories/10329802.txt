The entire memory hierarchy is measured, including onboard cache latency and size, external cache latency and size, main memory latency, and TLB miss latency.

Only data accesses are measured; the instruction cache is not measured.

The benchmark runs as two nested loops. The outer loop is the stride size. The inner loop is the array size. For each array size, the benchmark creates a ring of pointers that point forward one stride. Traversing the array is done by

The size of the array varies from 512 bytes to (typically) eight megabytes. For the small sizes, the cache will have an effect, and the loads will be much faster. This becomes much more apparent when the data is plotted.|||
