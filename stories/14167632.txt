This is a bunch of code to port Keras neural network model into pure C++. Neural network weights and architecture are stored in plain text file and input is presented as in case of image. The code is prepared to support simple Convolutional network (from MNIST example) but can be easily extended. There are implemented only ReLU and Softmax activations.

It is working with the Theano backend - support for Tensorflow will be added soon.

If you want to test dumping for your network, please use script. Please provide there your network architecture and weights. The script do following job:|||
