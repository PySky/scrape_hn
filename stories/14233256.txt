1c is aimed to compile TypeScript to runnable code on both JVM and web browser. You can implement the full stack with TypeScript while using libraries from Maven and NPM together.

To make it clear, I'd like to quote from sparkjava.com:

Lately, a lot of server-side web development has been taken over by NodeJS, but a growing number of NodeJS developers are using TypeScript and other statically typed languages that compile to JavaScript. Why not go all the way and use a language that was actually designed with types, and intended to run on the server-side? You also get all the benefits of running your application on the JVM, where libraries arenâ€™t deprecated every day.

Here is what 1c can offer: you can have TypeScript for the server-side and run it on the JVM.

Let's use spark as an example.

This is almost the same as the Quick Start example of spark, except that I am going to print a green with the NPM library chalk.

You can use the command line to test it now.
