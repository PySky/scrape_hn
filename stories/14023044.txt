The new TS050 Hybrid is based on the version it ran last year, but has been all but completely redesigned to the point that it only shares its basic carbon-monocoque chassis with the 2016 version.

The hybrid LMP1 packs a 2.4-liter twin-turbo V6 engine paired with an 8-megajoule electric motor – the same as last year’s, only redesigned from the block up. The vehicle has also been reshaped in compliance with the latest changes to the regulations, designed to make the cars slower than last year’s in an effort to increase safety. It was presented in low-downforce specification for higher-speed tracks, with a higher-downforce package to follow for more technical circuits.|||
