Uber has reportedly extended the internal investigation it is conducting over allegations of harassment at work. The company now expects a full report sometimes near the end of May. An extension has been granted with regards to the time the investigation is taking so as to ensure that all the relevant facts come out into the light.

The case came to light when former Uber employee Susan Fowler claimed that she was harassed while she was working at the cab aggregator. She further went on to say that her reports to the HR department of the company went unanswered because the culprit was apparently a top performer. Fowler outlined all this is a Medium post which was widely circulated around the Internet.

Following the revelation, Uber set up a team to investigate the matter. The investigation is taking place under the eyes of Board director Arianna Huffington. It was Huffington, who in a memo to employees on Thursday, said that the board sub comittee had granted a request for more time to complete the assessment.

The investigation also consists of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Tammy Albarran, who are partners at the law firm Covington & Burling,as its key members. It is proceeding with its investigation in various ways, including conducting interviews to discover more about the case, and about similar cases, if any.

The committee expects to turn in the results of its investigation by May end.|||
