TechCrunch recently ran an article on the "Internet of Things 2.0", and seem to say that it will be a major architectural change from what currently goes on.

Some examples of what they consider "IoT 2.0":

“Most IoT devices will require a non-interactive method to login, so the use of cryptographic materials such as certificates and private keys becomes ever more necessary,” "One of the key characteristics of the IoT 2.0 will be common standards. The IoT umbrella is vast, and the many industries it covers – from factories and automotive through to building automation and networking – each have their own protocols, interfaces and hardware."

They also say:

It might be five years distant, but IoT 2.0 is on its way, with device miniaturisation, better power efficiency and connectivity, more sophisticated system architectures, and new machine learning algorithms all in the pipeline. Says Tcherevik: “IoT 2.0 is all but inevitable.”

However, some of the points made there already seem to be considered good practice, so it seem to me that their idea of an "IoT 2.0" is mostly just confusing and not very valuable.

Is there anything I'm missing, or does the article just bundle together current best practices and call it "IoT 2.0"?

Obviously, it's difficult to speculate on what the future actually will hold, so I don't expect to discuss what could happen, rather: aren't most of the things mentioned already possible, just not adopted for cost-saving/complexity reasons?|||
