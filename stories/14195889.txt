jvmtop is a lightweight console application to monitor all accessible, running jvms on a machine.

 In a top-like manner, it displays JVM internal metrics (e.g. memory information) of running java processes.

 

 Jvmtop does also include a CPU console profiler.

 

 It's tested with different releases of Oracle JDK, IBM JDK and OpenJDK on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and Windows hosts.

 Jvmtop requires a JDK - a JRE will not suffice.

 

 Please note that it's currently in an alpha state -

 if you experience an issue or need further help, please let us know.

 

 Jvmtop is open-source. Checkout the source code. Patches are very welcome!

 

 Also have a look at the documentation or at a captured live-example.



In VM detail mode it shows you the top CPU-consuming threads, beside detailed metrics:
