Is Juvenile The Right Way To Go? | The Injustice of Juvenile

Minors go the juvie; adults to prison. Minors aren’t prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law; adults are. Minors get let off the hook more easily than adults. Minors are educated; adults are imprisoned. That is how the justice system works, and I find it troubling. Why should the punishment be different towards different people for the same crime? It’s somewhat like racism if you ask me. Persecuting different people differently for the same thing. It’s kind of like how black men are treated in (some of) America.

Is it, perhaps, too early? Or is it too late? What I’m about to say may strike a nerve with some, or a chord with others. Either way, stick with me till the end, however controversial you find it to be – please.

My thinking is that juvie doesn’t really have a proper, substantial reason to exist. The main concept is that it isn’t safe for children in normal prisons. It affects the brain of young people adversely. So really, it’s a protectionist measure for criminals. While that may sound terribly prejudiced, I do agree that it helps in some cases (examples are at the end of the post).

To fully understand how juvie works, lets look at the factors taken into consideration during an underage case. According to nolo.com, they are:

So this backs up my claim of juvie being discriminatory. The offender’s gender is taken into account. And the article even says that boys are more likely to be charged than girls!

But all that set aside, even if there were no absurd factors, juvenile still doesn’t make any sense!

Why should someone, purely because of their age, be given a less severe punishment?! It just makes no sense. When the offender committed the crime, they would have been fully aware of the consequences of being caught. Yet, they will face less severe charges.

In fact, they may not even face charges at all. Nolo.com says that the police officer who catches the criminal, may chose to employ the “counseled and released method”, whereby the police officer simply gives the minor a warning and let’s them off the hook.

In my mind, minors are just as guilty as adults, and thankfully, the court thinks so too – in some cases only though 😦

Shawn – The Court Being Too Lenient

Shawn was convicted of stabbing his own father repeatedly. He plead for pardon in front of a juvenile court to avoid facing adult charges. His request was finally granted and he was sent off to juvie.

Had an adult done the same crime, they would have almost definitely been sentenced to a few years in jail.

José – How Juvie Can Help

José’s case is the one I referred to in the beginning of the post. He took part in a violent gang fight, and ended up killing a man, and gravely injuring another. He was sent off to juvie (should have been sent to prison, if you ask me. A life sentence – no less!) where he positively turned his life around.

Manny was one of the members of a gang who assaulted an entire family. He used guns, and ended up killing a pregnant lady too. Thankfully, Manny was tried in adult court and sent prison for nine years.
