As promised in my last post, ComputerCraft (the popular Minecraft mod I’ve been working on since 2011) is now open source! Here’s a link to the complete source code on GitHub:

With the source code available, people other than myself can now work on updates, fix bugs, and add new features. I’ll still be reviewing pull requests and making releases, so this could mean ComputerCraft is updated more regularly and with more features than it has been in years. I’m looking forward to seeing what people come up with!|||
