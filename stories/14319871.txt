Rhett May’s “Creatures of the Night” album is turning the heads of both critics and music-lovers.  This versatile set of tunes includes many hints of jazz, funk and psychedelic rock while still holding it’s own as a stand-alone album that, if listened to all the way through, will impress even the most seasoned musician with it’s cohesive and naturally flowing nature.  Scottie Carlito of Carlito’s Music Blog wrote, “’Creatures of the Night’ is an entertaining and highly intelligent reminder of what a quality songwriter and musician can accomplish.”|||
