I started taking these notes when doing Dan Boneh crypto course on Coursera and when solving Matasano challenges. Both are highly recommended. While trying to learn some more crypto I am gradually adding further content.

Some basic number theory and its applications in cryptography: number_theory.md.

Public key security definitions and most known schemes (ElGamal, RSA, DSA): public_key_security.md.

Brief descriptions of some of the attacks included in Matasano challenges (length-extension attacks, Bleichenbacher, hash collisions, Wang, RC4 biases ... ): attacks.md.

Briefly about Elliptic Curves Cryptography (ECC) and how to speed up ECC operations: ecc.md.

Ciphers (only AES for now): ciphers.md.

Brief description of some crypto libraries (OpenSSL, scrypt, NaCl, SJCL): crypto_libraries.md.

How some applications use crypto: applications.md.

Some basic info on how to work with bits and bytes in different languages can be found in folder bits_manipulations.|||
