Bitmoji is the fastest-growing app in America, per comScore, with a more than 5000% increase in monthly unique visitors over the past two years. E-commerce apps OfferUp and letgo are the 2nd and 3rd fastest-growing apps.

The findings from comScore's latest study highlight three of the fastest-growing mobile market trends:

Why it matters: As comScore identified last year, we are now at or nearing "peak app" usage, meaning that most smartphone users download zero or only one new app per month. Thus, selectivity around app downloads illuminates trends that represent a major shift in the internet economy. Before smartphone app usage came to dominate mobile time spent, consumers mostly used the internet to bring real-world interactions online, like dating, mail and shopping. The rise of these three mobile app trends show how much the app economy is moving towards improving real-world engagements, like car travel, group get-togethers, and local commerce selling/trading.|||
