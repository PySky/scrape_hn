Make your Raspberry Pi act as a Keyboard via HID emulation.

The main purpose of this setup script is to make the Pi « emulate » a keyboard when connected to a computer.

This project is voluntary small and simple to be used as a base for more complex projects (like hot keyboard remapping, Pi as Keyboard controller, etc)

All this setup as been tested on my Raspberry Pi Zero W the 2016/03/21.

️ ️ Do not connect the Pi on the Power connector. Use the « Data » USB port instead to power and data exchange.

Connect on the Pi and run the setup script.

This script will send scancodes to the computer connected on the Pi.|||
