It's time for the highly anticipated Q&A session at your event. 



You could pass a microphone around the room; a few bold people will ask some good questions and it will go well. 



Or, you could also use Assenty to get questions from anyone who has one, bold or not. 



It's free to submit questions and everyone can see each question posted to your online Question Board and vote for the ones they want answered. 



As moderator, you get to reward the best questions with Gold, Silver or Bronze status badges that look great on social media. They look like this: 

  Gold Question Award    Silver Question Award    Bronze Question Award 



You also get a permanent link to your Question Board that works hard as a search engine-friendly SEO archive of your event. 



Did we mention that you can also answer questions submitted to your Question Board? The answers show up straight away. 



And, our unique, real-time stats show votes and question activity as it happens. Watch video.
