How do I use it ?

Place your phone in a fixed position on your exercise machine, and make sure that the camera is oriented towards you. That's it. Any exercise bike (besides sitting bikes) or elliptical machine will work.

How does it work ?

The app works by using motion analysis algorithms and your phone's front facing camera. It is the same principle that sits behind consoles like Kinect.

Is there an Android version ?

No, not yet. You can only play on iOS for now.
