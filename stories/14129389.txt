I am new to Python, and I wanted to read an easy book, that would give me a hight level overview of the language and what I can do with it.

Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart was exactly what I was looking for.

The book starts out a little slow, since Part I covered the Python Programming Basics, with the emphasis on the Basics. I quickly read through it though, because I wanted to familiarize myself with Python syntax, and I am glad that I did. I‚Äôve picked up some nice tips (copy and paste into clipboard, joining strings etc.) in Part I, that I would have missed otherwise.

Part II goes into practical application of the core concepts and it is summarized in the next section. Overall, the book was clearly written by somebody who spent many years working with Python. It read like a collection of useful tips, with most examples being less than 20 lines of code.

Bellow is the list of modules that author discussed in his book. Knowing what module to use is already half the battle üôÇ You might want to save this list, for the next time you‚Äôll find yourself asking ‚ÄúWhat module do I use to do X in Python?‚Äù

The author takes us through the following areas that can be automated with Python. I am also highlighting some of the examples that stood out for me.

Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation

I though that Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart was a great read. Not only did the book provide an easy introduction to the Python programming language, but also opened my eyes (as mostly a web developer) to different kinds of tasks that I can easily automated with Python.|||
