Gravitational Teleport (“Teleport”) is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing clusters of Linux servers via SSH or HTTPS. It is intended to be used instead of sshd.

Teleport enables teams to easily adopt the best SSH practices like:

Teleport is built on top of the high-quality Golang SSH implementation and it is compatible with OpenSSH.

Mature tech companies with significant infrastructure footprints tend to implement most of these patterns internally. Teleport allows smaller companies without significant in-house SSH expertise to easily adopt them, as well.

Being a complete standalone tool, Teleport can be used as a software library enabling trust management in complex multi-cluster, multi-region scenarios across many teams within multiple organizations.

Teleport comes with an accesible Web UI and a very permissive Apache 2.0 license to facilitate adoption and use.

Teleport was created by Gravitational Inc. We built Teleport by borrowing from our previous experiences at Rackspace. It has been extracted from Gravity, our hardened “Kubernetes on Autopilot” system for helping our customers to deploy and remotely manage their SaaS applications in multiple AWS regions or even behind-firewall on-premise environments.

The best way to contribute is to create issues or pull requests on Github. Or you can reach out directly to the Gravitational team via [email protected]
