Although the 840-hp (on 100 octane race fuel) 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon has been blowing up the internet, another high-powered American muscle car was also introduced at the 2017 New York auto show. Florida-based Trans Am Worldwide revealed the 1,000-hp Trans Am 455 Super Duty this week. Just 50 examples of the 455 Super Duty will be built.

Where previous Trans Am Worldwide cars were based on the fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro, and GM’s Zeta chassis, the new Trans Am 455 Super Duty is the first model built around the sixth-gen Camaro and the lighter Alpha chassis.

Power for the Trans Am 455 Super Duty comes from a 455-cubic-inch (7.4-liter) version of GM’s current Generation V LT1 V-8 engine topped off with a Magnuson TVS2300 supercharger that provides 14 psi of boost — that’s 0.5 psi less than the new Challenger SRT Demon. A cold air intake and ceramic coated headers and 3.0-inch exhaust brings power to 1,000 hp and 1,046 lb-ft of torque, or 160 hp and 276 lb-ft more than the Demon on race gas and 192 hp and 329 lb-ft more than the Demon on 91 octane.

Trans Am Worldwide says the engine is built in conjunction with an unnamed premier NASCAR engine builder from Martinsville, Va. A quick Google search suggests it could come from Arrington Performance owned by NASCAR racer and team owner Joey Arrington.|||
