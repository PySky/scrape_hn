We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 17.4. The major development in this release is the enhanced functionality of coded barcode. More often it is seem that code text contains complex combination of digits and letters. With Aspose.BarCode for SSRS 17.4, parsing and validation of those complex combinations is possible.

Aspose.BarCode for SSRS allows developers to generate coded barcode according to AI (Application Identifier) specifications. New validators have been incorporated that can validate text code having only digits and complex AIs (combination of digits & letters). API will throw an exception in case it fails to validate. According to AI specification (ref: 703 AI, with letters – 324a, with more than 4 symbols) code text “(703)123” is incorrect. Aspose.BarCode will throw following exception if user tries to generate the barcode with EncodeTypes as GS1Code128. The following exception message will be displayed for such an incorrect barcode.

Checksum calculation and validation for such and many more AI specifications have been implemented.

This month’s release also includes few bug fixes that were reported by our customers in the previous release. Details about these fixes are listed below.
