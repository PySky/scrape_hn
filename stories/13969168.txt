Poisson-disc sampling produces points that are tightly-packed, but no closer to each other than a specified minimum distance, resulting in a more natural pattern.

The animation above uses an efficient O(n) algorithm due to Robert Bridson.

In Random Points on a Sphere, I used Mitchellâ€™s best-candidate algorithm to obtain a poisson-disc distribution on a sphere.
