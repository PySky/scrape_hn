With the list of their attendees. Can we make it?

We at Standuply, while working hard on a Slack bot for Agile teams, like to have fun and make some noise. Since we are excited about AI and bots, we would like to get to know others who feel the same. So we have an idea:

This way everybody could pick the best conference for them and engage with visitors before an event. Wouldn’t that be cool? So we’ve composed a list of AI and chatbot conferences in 2017.

Now let’s fill it up ☝️ ️

Leave me a note near an event you’re interested or going to. Then I will submit your name on the list. If you’re not on Medium, reach me on Twitter at @alexkistenev and I will put your Twitter handle on the list as well.

As of May-2 the list contains: 88 events.
