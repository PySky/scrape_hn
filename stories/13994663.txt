MRC Vegas was an exciting event - it’s an excellent opportunity to meet merchants and listen to their pain points, and to hear what problems they’re struggling with and what success stories they can share in their effort to control fraud losses while growing their businesses. We’ve made a list of the topics we noticed came up in every conversation.

While not everyone is doing it, everyone is definitely talking about it. The push for automation and accuracy has pushed most fraud teams towards solutions that include machine learning as a key component in their detection strategy.  From powering biometric face detection to replacing rules - we reckon everyone is either using machine learning or considering adding it to their solution in 2017.

Historically ATO attacks targeted mostly very large companies. There has been a recent trend of medium sized merchants experiencing attacks directed towards them. These attacks take place in two stages: First, parallelized “credential stuffing”, often using botnets in order to evade detection systems. The second is extracting value from the compromised accounts by hijacking accounts and performing fraudulent purchases. Stopping these at the credential stuffing stage and the later use of hijacked accounts is essential for a comprehensive fraud solution.|||

Now that the Ravelin team has finally recovered from jet lag, senior data 
scientist Ereli Eran took some time to reflect on MRC Vegas. Not only did 
we have a great time with the other attendees, we also gained some 
invaluable insight into the reality of fraud so far in 2017.
