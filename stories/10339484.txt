Some days you wake up and you see announcements of a new project to digitize a collection of primary source materials. Perhaps an archive that covers centuries of technological and commercial changes, perhaps a collection of newspapers that encompasses the history of African-American politics and culture, just to name a couple of purely hypothetical examples.

I don’t know any details about such agreements and neither do you, unless you happen to be one of the top-level executives at one of the holding institutions for these collections or at one of the companies doing the digitization. And because we don’t know any details, we don’t know whether such projects are great or not. But we can—and we should—ask some questions when we hear about them:

I do not know the details of such agreements between libraries and archives and the commercial enterprises that digitize and sell their collections. I cannot say unequivocally that these agreements are good or bad things. Digitization can be very expensive; digital access can be very powerful. Balancing the two sides is complicated. But researchers and librarians should ask themselves this list of questions before cheerleading announcements.

Ideally, we shouldn’t just be responding to announcements, but taking proactive steps. We should be asking ourselves how can we balance the desire to have digital access to the rare materials we want with the recognition that libraries and archives and museums cannot simply bear the brunt of the cost of doing it themselves. Do you value access to digital collections? What are you doing to support the work of libraries and openly accessible research materials? What are the ways that we—whether we work in libraries and museums as staff or as researchers—can create high quality digitizations without selling our cultural heritage to the highest bidder?|||
