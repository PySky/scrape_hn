Animated state transitions that update with your data. This library uses d3-timer to efficiently manage thousands of state tweens. You can apply high-performance state animations using an approachable, easy to implement syntax. Get Started.

Resonance is available as an npm package.

The NodeGroup component allows you to create complex animated transitions. You pass it an array of objects and a key accessor function and it will run your enter, update and leave transitions as the data updates. The idea is similar to transition components like react-transition-group or react-motion's TransitionMotion but you use objects to express how you want your state to transition. Not only can you can have independent duration, delay and easing for entering, updating and leaving but each individual key in your state can define its own timing.

Resonance handles much of the heavy lifting for...

To run the documentation/examples site in this repo locally:

You can animate any component with Resonance, but it was developed by experimenting with animated SVG charts and redux. This library is great for creating abstact animated data visualizations in React. You can view the example code here for the chart examples. Each example is a mini redux application with its actions and reducers defined in a small module. You can run these examples locally by following the direction above.|||
