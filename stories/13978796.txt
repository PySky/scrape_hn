Delbot understands your voice commands, searches news and knowledge sources, and summarizes and reads out content to you.

TL;DR: If you want to dive straight into the code, you can head over to Delbot, my GitHub repository for this project.

Bots remain a hot topic. Everyone is talking about them.

How about building one from scratch? The simple one we will build today will understand and answer questions like:

Our goal is to code a bot from the ground up and use nature language processing (NLP) while doing so.

In addition, our bot will be voice-enabled and web-based if you complete the web app section as well. The best part is we do not need to do anything fancy for speech recognition and synthesis: we will use a built-in capability of modern web browsers.

At a high level, we want to be able to understand two broad types of queries. Following is the flowchart.

We might ask for news. E.g.:

The bot will query the API of the requested news source (New York Times if none is specified) and summarize the results:

We might ask a knowledge question. E.g.:

And the bot will answer:|||

Bots remain a hot topic. Everyone is talking about them. How about building one from scratch using Python? The simple one we will build today understands and answers news and knowledge questions.
