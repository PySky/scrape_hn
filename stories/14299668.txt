Nutanix is delighted to be participating at the OpenStack Summit May 8-11 in Boston this year. It's great to see the growth and excitment in this community. We are participating in a number of activites and sessions and hope to see you at the show.

In this session, see a live demo that proves how easy day-2 datacenter operations are when using Nutanix in an OpenStack powered cloud. The combined approach offers you the best of both worlds: OpenStack's open API for provisioning automation, with the ease of operations provided by the industry leading hyperconverged infrastructure platform. This combination enables you to build a private or public cloud that delivers the agility you want, at the costs you need.

Enjoy the recording of the session
