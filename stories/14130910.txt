Welcome to Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (now version 0.91 -- see book news for details), a free online operating systems book! The book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently. Lots of fun stuff!

This book is and will always be free in PDF form, as seen below. For those of you wishing to BUY a copy, please consider the following:

A wonderful hardcover edition (v0.91) - this may be the best printed form of the book (it really looks pretty good), but it is also the most expensive way to obtain the black book of operating systems (a.k.a. the comet book or the asteroid book according to students). Now just: $36.00 An almost-as-wonderful (and somewhat cheaper) softcover edition (v0.91) - this way is pretty great too, if you like to read printed material but want to save a few bucks. NEW! Now just: $21.00 A pretty awesome electronic edition (v0.91) - this is a nice convenience and adds things like a hyperlinked table of contents, glossary of terms, lists of hints, tips, systems advice, and a few other things not seen in the free version, all in one massive DRM-free PDF. Just: $10.00 An alpha version for Kindle - Really, this is just the PDF and does not (yet) include all the bells and whistles common in e-pub books.

Another way to help the book out: cite it! Here is the BiBTeX entry (seen below); you can also link to the site of the best free operating systems book on the market.

And now, the free online form of the book, in chapter-by-chapter form (now with chapter numbers!):|||
