Geoff – 

 Thank for posting this most excellent blog entry!

You are certainly correct that much of the discussion at the recent ARIN meeting focused on Whois data accuracy matters, but it’s probably worth clarifying one point you made – “The analogous reference in the days of telephony was a ‘reverse phone book’ where a phone number could be traced to a subscriber. If this was possible for the telephone network, why can’t we do this for the Internet? After all, everyone who generates an online transaction uses an IP address. Why can’t we publish some form of ‘Internet Reverse Phone Book’ listing all IP addresses with end entities?”

To be clear, the LEA interest in ARIN Draft Policy 2017-3 is not aimed at end entities, but instead predominantly aims to improve the accuracy of the Whois registry records which lead to the ISP at the edge of the network serving that end-entity.   This is a fairly important distinction, and called out explicitly in the problem statement: “For organizations tasked with protecting the general public, one of the most important registration records in the ARIN public access WHOIS directory is that of the last ISP in the chain of network operators providing connectivity.”

It will be up to the community to determine the merits of the draft policy, but reliable identification of the serving ISP would allow LEA entities to utilize traditional lawful process with the serving ISP on the first attempt, rather than having iterate to find to the correct ISP.   In addition to improving timeliness of public safety efforts, the ability to know the appropriate jurisdiction can actually improve the privacy rights of those involved.

This minor clarification aside, I’d like to thank you for your wonderful summary of the ARIN 39 meeting, as well as for your fine presentation on Addressing 2016!|||
