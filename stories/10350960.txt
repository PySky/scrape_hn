And for a while now, Brazil's richest man, Jorge Lemann, has been eyeing $178.2 billion beverage-giant Coca-Cola, according to Bloomberg.

"We'd love to take a look at Coca-Cola," Lemann said in 2008 at a private meeting, according to the report.

"We could run it with 200 people," he joked.

That would mean cutting most of Coke's 100,000 employees.

Lemann has strung together some of the biggest acquisitions of all time in the past five years through his investment company, 3G Capital. The 76-year-old billionaire is known for his cutthroat management style and the swift layoffs that follow an acquisition.
