A parody of the 2007 track Thou Shalt Always Kill, by Dan le Sac vs Scroobius Pip, recorded for the 2014 Show Christmas special. This track updates the original into the 2010s and the era of the modern Internet. The 2014 Show ceased to be, but I now run the https://podiant.co/ podcast hosting platform, and make http://moodelevator.org/ among many other projects.|||
