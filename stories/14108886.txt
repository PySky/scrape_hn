In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I chat with Sashko Stubailo and Jonas Helfer from Meteor to discuss Apollo, a set of tools developed to make GraphQL easier to use.

They explain that while GraphQL is a great technology, the ecosystem of tools for the technology is still developing. They also discuss Optics, a paid service that collects server data and delivers analytics and performance information.

Sashko Stubailo manages the development of Apollo and Meteor open source technologies at Meteor. As tech lead, Sashko developed initial versions of the Apollo Client library and led the Apollo initiative to build GraphQL data loading tools.

Jonas Helfer is a Software Engineer at Meteor, and a PhD candidate at MIT focused on improving the safety and security of computer systems. Jonas has extensive experience building websites and engineering the backends they rely on.

Netlify is an all-in-one platform for deploying and automating modern web projects.

Simply push and Netlify provides everythingâ€”servers, CDN, continuous delivery, HTTPS, staging environments, prerendering, asset post processing, DNS, and more.

Any project, big or small, can perform instantly on a global scale.|||
