So far it’s mostly about the little RAKE keyword extractor you can see working above, but I have more plans for it - in particular, I expect to try my hand at doing TF-IDF and document clustering “by hand” once I can find a couple of vacant hours one evening.

In the meantime, given the limited time I have, I decided to go low-brow for a bit and take a little time to start building a minimal web UI and examining what I could do differently with the new web stacks now surfacing around .

It didn’t take me much time to get around to trying Sanic, which leverages to achieve a massively impressive performance of 25.000 requests per second on my MacBook (an i5 clocking in at 2.9GHz):

However, this is where I’ve started getting seriously annoyed at , not just because it has a fair amount of impact in program structure (Sanic is OK, but I miss the simpler structure of Bottle, as well as all the nice stuff I built to use with it over the years), but also because it can be a right pain to remember to for a future when it’s not immediately obvious that what you’re trying to serve up to the browser isn’t a “normal” result.|||
