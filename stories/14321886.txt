Belarus will be opening a technology transfer center in Egypt after the two countries entered into a partnership. This has been revealed by Vladimir Gusakov, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (NASB), in Belarus.

“Today we are hosting a large delegation of Egyptian scientists. We have already had preliminary talks with the president of the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology and identified a range of potential cooperation areas and projects. We agreed to set up a technology transfer center, a branch of our Academy of Sciences in Egypt, that would facilitate the transfer of technology and solutions developed by Belarusian scientists to Egypt. Plans have been made to open the center in Cairo. Belarusian and Egyptian specialists will work there,” Gusakov is reported to have said.

Gusakov added that the Egyptians have demonstrated interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/Drones) among other areas of interest.

“We appreciate the friendly relations between our countries. Belarusian companies are well-known in Egypt thanks to their high-quality products, including agricultural equipment. Bearing this is mind, we defined this area as a priority cooperation field. Water purification, materials science, and pharmaceutics are also important for us,” said Mahmoud Sakr, President of the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology.
