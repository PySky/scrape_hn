The glEnd of Zelda(): Automatic 3Dification of NES Games

Hi! This is my software for SIGBOVIK 2016, an April 1 conference that usually publishes fake research. And as usual, my contribution is real! This about an emulator that renders NES games in 3D (with some manual steps), and techniques that can automate those manual steps. It's a sidebar to my work on Nintendo AI.

Check out my research paper, The glEnd() of Zelda for more details on how it actually works. It appeared in SIGBOVIK 2016 (bibtex).

The source code is here.
