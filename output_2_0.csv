comment,14278256,,,1494035842,,Myrmornis,"Psychiatry is such an embarrassment, in the US and UK at least. So many otherwise reasonably intelligent people believe in the concrete reality of &quot;diagnoses&quot; that are merely descriptive at best, and delusional at worst. The number of parents who are led to believe that their child &quot;has&quot; &quot;dyslexia&quot; or &quot;ADHD&quot; is astonishing; and the ramifications in terms of extra time in exams, free laptops etc are absurd. One form of evidence for these assertions is the lack of cultural replication: I don&#x27;t have citations, but I understand that many of these concepts do not have parallels in other languages&#x2F;cultures where one would would expect replication if these really were biological phenomena. I guess people will always see shapes in clouds, but when it comes to serious matters like education, the rational, scientific side of our society needs to be kind but firm in stamping this stuff out. But when will it finally happen -- perhaps not until we&#x27;ve also got over the idiocy of religion, and the idiocy of the &quot;postmodernism&quot;-influenced humanities?"
comment,14278253,,,1494035819,,rabbyte,"speaking for myself it&#x27;s not ever the offense I take issue with it&#x27;s the ubiquity of popular offense. that every space must be a space wherein offensive speech is permitted including spaces created to cater to other genuine concerns such as recovery from debilitating trauma. churches have been a safe space for certain kinds of thought for centuries, some churches even creating a safe space within their safe space where a person can confess to any sin without suffering the adverse social affects.<p>it&#x27;s on this point that I think people lose their minds. the vulnerable see a world completely set against them and have no ability to create an island for themselves so they over react and become militant with time as popular social movements continually fail to understand them. I see wrong on both ends for different reasons but in a hyper connected world where everything is happening all the time, the marginalized by definition must lose out. the freedom to offend is not the only attribute worth protecting, despite how very serious our history teaches us otherwise. the world isn&#x27;t just becoming smaller, it&#x27;s becoming flat, and that is another dimension worth pushing against.<p>there are no easy positions to take here. there are no obvious answers. defending free speech is obvious and good and I&#x27;m in favor of erring on the side of caution but the longer people take a principled stand on offense and dismiss the motivations of the people pushing against it, the further this situation will deteriorate."

comment,14278229,,,1494035374,,yeukhon,I understand. I have another motivation which is getting JSON and wanting a OOP object to mainpluate with. Take AWS&#x27; boto3 response. Well documented but the nested response structure gives me a chill and I wish there&#x27;s a direct object out of the JSON. I instead had to write my own class for the conversion. If I could mainpluate dict like mainpluatig attribute in a class then I could just write my function&#x27;s contract &quot;input is a response object from X APi&quot; instead of &quot;dict of this form.&quot;<p>Quite annoying and I know some people considered what I wish is a bad practice.

comment,14278214,,,1494035108,,rjeli,"I learned programming through Scratch as a young kid. I was frustrated with the limitations of the syntax, and the lack of structured programming (although I didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for). However, I loved it and came back to it every single night for the community - uploading new games I made, getting comments and loves from my friends, and not only checking out their games but downloading them and reading the source.<p>edit, as I keep thinking about this: Remixes were also huge - not only could you download someone&#x27;s project, you could tweak it and reupload it as a remix. There were also galleries with curators, which motivated me to make better projects.
I think the language&#x27;s limitations might have encouraged me to think outside the box, actually... simple things were easy, but any complex logic was very difficult. No functions, only event-driven broadcasts and receivers, and the events had to be pre-declared (no dynamic stuff). I remember doing a lot of hacky stuff with lists, like having look-up tables in lists, or having to implement really simple algorithms on my own in this constrained language..."

comment,14278199,,,1494034903,,yeukhon,"Your view on self-driving car is different than mine. I am not sure who came up with the five levels of self-driving car automation, but let me reiterate the last time before I give up trying to convince anyone on this thread.<p>First, for a computer to be able to navigate safely on the road the computer needs to be able to recongize and understand its surroundings. Checked.<p>Next, for computers to be able to be good at driving, we need to train the computer both in the real world and in simulations.<p>Moreover, to ensure we can optimize route, plan ahead we need data about road condition far ahead of us (and sometimes behind us). To be able to make turns on an intersection safely and swiftly, unlike humans who are terrible at making turns and confusing when to turn, computers can coordinate with one another. This requires good network communication. Bluetooth is weak and unstable. In my earlier example, if an ambulance says it is driving heading my direction, my car can coordinate how to empty up a lane for the ambluance to pass. This level of automation is what one sees in a sci-fi movie, which is really what you want besides being able to avoid obstacles like Bat mobile.<p>My point is, we should explore how to make traffic data accessible. There is so much one can do with such data. It takes a good amount of time to get the government onboard and help them build such infrastructure. To finish off my point, meter data is not available, right now apps use crowd source to determine whether a parking spot is available or not. Instead of driving around which causes
more congestion and sometimes accident, governement should make meter data available, and we can still crowd source by using driver&#x27;s camera to recongize whether a spot is opened and send back to datastore.<p>This is essentially the goal of Internet of Things, at rhe city scale. As I mentioned, IBM&#x27;s SmartCities supposed to do stuff above but I really am not sure if IBM will ever pull off given many of their projects ended up on someoen&#x27;s desk covering in dust."

comment,14278187,,,1494034685,,Bjartr,"The difference in the brain for Adderall v. Vyvanse comes down to the concentration of which enantiomoers are (how much of which mirror image of amphetamine there is). It&#x27;s all amphetamine, it all affects the same receptors. The real difference comes down to how long it stays available. Vyvanse sticks around in the blood longer than &quot;plain&quot; amphetamine, but amphetamine crosses into the brain much faster. Both of those are because the liver has to first cleave off the extra molecule tacked onto the amphetamine that makes it Vyvanse. That can only happen so fast, and until it does it&#x27;s too big to cross the blood&#x2F;brain barrier or get otherwise disposed of."

comment,14278160,,,1494034308,,drawnwren,"Another anecdote from someone on HN, which probably biases pretty hard for people who have had success medicating ADHD. I dropped out of a bottom tier state school at 19 studying CS with essentially a 0.0. In my mid 20s I was diagnosed with ADHD by a GP and a psychiatrist and got a second opinion from a second psychiatrist who said the first two were wrong. I stopped medication because of sentiment like that expressed in the article. A year or two later I decided I didn&#x27;t like what I was doing, and wanted to return to school. I saw a second GP and got rediagnosed and prescribed. I&#x27;m now studying CS at a top 5 university with a 4.0.<p>My personal opinion is that there is more harm from the negative stigma associated w&#x2F; ADHD prescription than good, but you can imagine I would be biased given my narrative."

Some of the best people on our team don’t have college degrees. However they are intensely curious and always trying to understand how and why things work, and how to improve them.

comment,14278052,,,1494032876,,mtdewcmu,"I think of ADD as Amphetamine Deficit Disorder. In a practical sense, &quot;ADD&quot; is the disorder that afflicts people who function better when given amphetamines. Personally, I feel that anyone who wants to take amphetamines should be allowed to.<p>I think that inability to concentrate is a common pathway for essentially all diseases that afflict man. Anything a disease does to draw your attention to itself is affecting concentration, because you are not able to concentrate on whatever you want to concentrate on. In some cases, this is insidious and you are not aware of the disease as such; it affects your concentration and you don&#x27;t understand why. In some cases, you might only know that you can&#x27;t concentrate. Amphetamines will tend to help, because they allow you to concentrate harder on what you want to concentrate on, regardless of the actual etiology of whatever is distracting you."

With that disclaimer out of the way lets begin:<p>From what I gather it (Adult ADHD) is also very hard to distinguish from bipolar disorder. It took 18 months of moving around with anti-psychotics and other drugs to treat my &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; before my doctor realized that it was ADHD and we found almost immediate results from the treatment.<p>It sucks that the diagnosis seems to be so easy to get for some people and they&#x27;re doing it for the adderall. In my case it helped me significantly, moving up in my career and ultimately bringing me out of an almost decade long depression with myself. I hope that people who actually need help get it, and to put it simply, screw the others who make it hard for people to be properly diagnosed. My diagnosis took so long because of the known abuse to get the drugs, from what I gathered in conversations with my doctor, and she was reluctant to consider that diagnosis until she was absolutely sure of it."

comment,14277956,,,1494031225,,aisofteng,"To go on a slight tangent but one I think very relevant here, considering other comments here about the overt politics of late night talk shows, such as another commenter&#x27;s remark about not recalling previous late night hosts resorting to so many partisan jokes, it seems most people are neither aware of the former FCC&#x27;s Fairness Doctrine nor its repeal:<p>&gt;The Fairness Doctrine was a policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was — in the Commission&#x27;s view — honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC, which was believed to have been under pressure from then President Ronald Reagan, eliminated the Doctrine in 1987. The FCC formally removed the language that implemented the Doctrine, in August of 2011.<p>Quote taken from: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fairness_Doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fairness_Doctrine</a><p>There used to be a requirement for broadcasting companies to make a good faith effort to present all sides of a topic and to actually accomplish that goal to a reasonable degree. I am not sure of the historical origins of that policy, but I imagine it was put in place in recognition of the ability of media to sway public opinion and therefore to what degree it could be abused by powerful players with an agenda.<p>I am generally against any governmental regulation of how people communicate, but in this case the regulation was not about content, per se, but about the fairness and integrity of our national information delivery channels. I don&#x27;t know why this was repealed - I keep meaning to research it - but in any case, the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine is a chief causal factor for the state of American media today.<p>As much as I appreciate Colbert now, as much as I watched and enjoyed the commentary by Stewart, Colbert, and others as political pundits, it is also very clear to me that part of their success in what they do is due to affirmation of political views they share with their viewers - and that that can be (and, in my opinion, has been) overall very detrimental because it has led people to silo their beliefs and become more close minded to hearing opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, the role of such pundits has become that of trading in-depth analysis for entertainment and laughs.<p>I generally agree with what seem to be Colbert&#x27;s views and often think he is very sharp and insightful. However, in the context of what I said above and considering how much influence he has, I think that the complaints and investigation discussed in TFA are well-founded."

comment,14277794,,,1494029279,,mindcrime,"<i>Out of curiosity, how much information do you retain from all the books that you&#x27;ve read?</i><p>That&#x27;s a really good question, and one I ask myself a lot.  I honestly don&#x27;t know, and I&#x27;ve read reference to some studies somewhere or other that suggest that most people retain fairly little of what they read.  So my strategy with a lot of books is to read the book, not take notes or anything really, and at the end, make a simple &quot;this is worth revisiting&quot; or &quot;this isn&#x27;t worth revisiting&quot; decision. If it is, I&#x27;ll read it again and either do some light pencil underlining or use post-it page flags to highlight important stuff, OR I&#x27;ll do a full-fledged &quot;create a wiki page for this book on my wiki and take detailed notes&quot; pass.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;ll do the &quot;light pencil underlining and post-it notes&quot; thing on the first pass.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting trade-off...

comment,14277728,,,1494028533,,Arizhel,"&gt;I think it is in society&#x27;s interest to arrange for there to be a number of job-vacancies of the Panera-kid-type available<p>I completely disagree.  It&#x27;s actively making things worse to not use more efficient methods.  Now if a restaurant wants to keep one of those people around for people who don&#x27;t like the kiosks, or maybe to talk to if they have a question about something or want to ask for something the kiosk can&#x27;t do, then that&#x27;s great, because that&#x27;s where people are actually useful: for handling things that automation can&#x27;t, like special cases.  Of course, you don&#x27;t need as many humans this way, since there aren&#x27;t that many people who the kiosk can&#x27;t serve.<p>But having people employed just for the sake of employment is nothing more than make-work.  It&#x27;s just like the Soviet factories where they built wooden crates on one side of the factory, then moved them to the other side of the factory where another team disassembled them for recycling, then moved the wood to the other side of the factory where it was used for building crates, ....  There&#x27;s no dignity in make-work.  If you&#x27;re worried about there not being enough jobs, the answer is the UBI: give people a regular stipend and let them spend it however they want.  At least some of them will find some new enterprise on their own, whether it&#x27;s writing a book (like JK Rowling, who was on welfare when she wrote the books that made her a millionaire--she&#x27;s worth almost $800M), or writing a phone game, or just doing odd jobs and not having to worry so much about having enough for rent because of the irregularity.  The other answer is to get the government to invest in its people by providing education, and by financing important projects (like replacing those bridges).  There&#x27;s plenty of work to be done without resorting to make-work."

comment,14277662,,,1494027795,,dfabulich,"They&#x27;ve been working on a module system for Java for years (codename Jigsaw), one goal of which is to modularize Java itself, and the other goal is to have a module system that developers would use. It hasn&#x27;t gone very well.<p>Today, to run a hello world app, you have to have the entire Java SE platform on disk, including GUI code, XML parsing, CORBA, a MIDI player, etc. A lot of that code is itself written in Java; you&#x27;ll find there&#x27;s a 64MB &quot;rt.jar&quot; file that provides a <i>lot</i> of stuff. One goal of Jigsaw is to allow you to write smaller Java applications on memory-constrained devices.<p>Jigsaw does an OK job at modularizing Java, but has mostly failed at its other goal: to provide a standard module system that Java developers would use. I&#x27;m sure somebody&#x27;s excited to use Jigsaw in their application code, but not many.<p>For example, Jigsaw&#x27;s module system has no notion of libraries with versions. Imagine using Maven or Gradle without any version numbers. That&#x27;s Jigsaw.<p>Jigsaw also set a bunch of other rules that get broken a lot in practice: no circular dependencies, immutable dependencies declared up front, resolve all modules eagerly, etc. These are good guidelines, but it may not be appropriate to make them iron clad rules.<p>In contrast, there&#x27;s a hugely complicated monster module system implemented in Java userland, OSGi. OSGi has a ton of features, including letting you load multiple versions of the &quot;same&quot; jar at once, so one part of your app can use the old version while another part uses a newer version. (And then there&#x27;s Maven, Gradle, etc.)<p>This certainly wouldn&#x27;t be the first time Java tried to deliver a &quot;standard&quot; solution for a problem that we used to solve in userland that went ignored by Java&#x27;s dev community. (Logging?!) If we all ignored Jigsaw and kept using Maven&#x2F;Gradle&#x2F;OSGi, but the Java platform became more modular, that&#x27;s probably a win.<p>But Jigsaw includes another poisonous feature; it &quot;improves security&quot; by forbidding access to internal JDK APIs like sun.misc.Unsafe, which provides access to direct memory management. For better or worse, that internal API has been used and abused by a lot of popular Java infrastructure libraries, so they&#x27;re now introducing a new Unsafe feature in Java 9, but it&#x27;s not the same one, &quot;breaking&quot; compatibility. It&#x27;s their reserved right to break that API, but but but.<p>And finally there&#x27;s the fact that Java 9 has taken a hugely long time, and this is significantly due to Jigsaw. If Jigsaw misses Java 9, does it land in Java 10? Throw it out completely? (Does Java <i>ever</i> get modularized?)"

I feel like the state of documentation of Haskell libraries in general could be much better.<p>There was actually a thread on &#x2F;r&#x2F;haskell a few months ago [0] in response to an HN comment.

The tutorial walks you through different pieces of the library, how to use them, and how they come together.<p>It&#x27;s hands down one of the most effective ways of documenting I&#x27;ve ever seen and I&#x27;d love to see other communities&#x27; take on it.<p>To point out a specific example, you should check out Turtle&#x27;s tutorial [1].<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;haskell&#x2F;comments&#x2F;5khts3&#x2F;on_haskell_documentation&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;haskell&#x2F;comments&#x2F;5khts3&#x2F;on_haskell_...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;turtle-1.3.3&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Turtle-Tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;turtle-1.3.3&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Turtle...</a>"

comment,14277623,,,1494027361,,Clubber,"Yes, I would also like to know how doubling the work force as a factor in pushing down wages is a fallacy (particularly in the 80s). I understand it&#x27;s a complex problem. Another factor in stagnant wages is automation and much of what we tout as worker productivity isn&#x27;t necessarily workers working 10x faster or harder, but automation allowing them to get 10x more done. Think in terms of Excel vs &quot;running the numbers&quot; manually, databases vs. file cabinets, etc. As an aside, part of the reason the VA is so inefficient is that many of their patient records are (were?) in file cabinets.<p>The worker doesn&#x27;t do 10x the work out of pure skill (though learning to use Excel is part of it) but the investment in licenses and software done by the business. It&#x27;s fair to say if the business invested in building a software system, they should reap the benefits of the productivity it yields, even though that stagnates wages. I also believe a worker who understands Excel should have higher wages than one that doesn&#x27;t, though today, it&#x27;s a requirement for a job in accounting."

comment,14277611,,,1494027148,,icantdrive55,"I repair watches.<p>I started out just loving Rolex Bubblebacks--years ago.  I loved all watches.  I started learning about the repair of watches.  It took me a awhile to accumulate the right tools, at the right price.  In order to be be efficent, it did take me a few years, but it was a hobby for myself.<p>The love of mechanical watches will just come around for a lot of people.  I haven&#x27;t figured if it&#x27;s because certain people like precisely engineered items, like Apple products, or it&#x27;s kinda the only acceptable form of adornment for men in all cultures, or men are subconsciously aware they die earlier than females.(Yes--some women just love all aspects of horology, but in my experience, it a different passion than men.  Plus--I can&#x27;t sell women&#x27;s high end watches.  It&#x27;s so difficult, I don&#x27;t even buy them for resale anymore.  It&#x27;s changing a bit though, especially with the Fitbit, and even female Rolexes are not sitting on a website for years anymore.<p>That said, once you imerce yourself in watch repair, there&#x27;s a moment where you look at an older Rolex movement, and a say a modified(usually just engine work on the movement) on a better ETA movement, and don&#x27;t see why a Rolex costs so much more.  Yes, their are differences quality differences, but not to the tune of thousand of dollars more.  Basically, a Rolex, Patek, IWC, etc., were machined to be easily taken apart.  A lot of thought was put into ease of repair. It&#x27;s ironic you can&#x27;t buy parts for said watches from the factory?<p>And here I go, that Rolex some of you are wearing on your wrist, when it goes out of warranty, you won&#x27;t be able to have just anyone repair it.  Rolex,  the Swatch Group, along with most of the other watch brands will have you send your timepiece back to the factory when it needs a service, or repair.  At factory prices. I refuse to spend $800 on a clean, and lube.<p>See, when you buy that $10,000 watch, even if you spent years learning how to repair, they won&#x27;t sell you parts, or even offer service diagrams.  It&#x27;s like buying a car, and having to take it to the dealership fir repairs forever, and not being able to buy parts for it.<p>Seiko is one watch company that still sells parts to consumers.<p>O.k.--what&#x27;s my point?  Certain high end watch companies, appear to be guilty of The Sherman Anti-trust Act.  Yes--the federal government looked into it, but figured it wasen&#x27;t a top priority, and called it a rich man&#x27;s problem.<p>To those interested, a grey market watch, like those at Costco, were bought overseas at overseas prices.  Rolex warranty will not honor those watches if they stop, even if under warranty.).<p>I just read the post about GI&#x27;s not being able to code.  If you happen to like watches, there&#x27;s a few watch repair schools left on the world.  Rolex is sponsoring many of them.  They need technicians at their factories.  Many schools offer free tuition, but not boarding.  It&#x27;s not a bad deal.<p>And again--if you&#x27;re about to spend thousands on a fine watch, call the watch company and ask about parts, and &quot;just what will happen when it goes out of warranty, and needs a service?&quot;."

Are you claiming that people choose those jobs over other, better jobs?<p>If I didn&#x27;t own a car and was considering making a career as an Uber driver I&#x27;d happily accept a lower level of pay and rent someone else&#x27;s car for a few months to get a sense of how much the job appealed to me and how hard I&#x27;d need to work to make money.<p>The person renting out the car is the one who has taken out loans and risk and now owns a depreciating asset.

comment,14277446,,,1494025238,,hwillis,"copying my other comment:<p>&gt;Lithium is one of the most prevalent elements on earth. Spodumene (rocky lithium ore) is likely to be a very important economic source in the future as it is much more common than the brine currently used to manufacture batteries. Brine requires a water pump to extract, spodumene requires mining like any normal mineral, but it&#x27;s found in extremely high quality deposits in the US including single crystals up to 47 feet across. That means higher quality lithium in addition to greater availability.<p>&gt;Spodumene is ~6-7% lithium by mass and is mined in an open pit, so no worries about soil or water pollution. It&#x27;s separated from other rocks by grinding, flotation, and then acid. Very few people like acid in their industrial processes but I will note that lithium production uses way less hydroflouric acid than oil refining. The final stage uses sulfuric acid and while again acid is never good, sulfuric acid is one of the most-used and most-produced chemicals. Most minerals require sulfuric acid for extraction. It comes in a bottle of drain cleaner. Mining lithium rock is as economically painless as buying blasting powder and excavators, and as environmentally painless as... well nothing. The pollution is basically negligible.<p>I didn&#x27;t know the gigafactory was gonna do component-level recycling, that&#x27;s pretty cool.  I think it should be relatively easy to separate the metals from the SEI and graphite&#x2F;lithium in a recoverable way, but processing the SEI has to be pretty complex.  Maybe acid would do it- at that point it would probably be worth it to recycle the lithium but you&#x27;d have to set up an entire process line just to be able to add it to raw feedstock ore.  It&#x27;ll take a LOT of battery recycling before that&#x27;s more profitable than selling it as clinker."

Historically with a constrained pool of labour, you&#x27;d expect wages to rise to get the few available candidates to work for you. Since the 1970&#x27;s, that pool is essentially 33-60% great than what it could have been. Also during the 1970&#x27;s you saw an increased rate of women attending university.

comment,14277284,,,1494023536,,kyleschiller,"There&#x27;s a huge difference between the theoretical ability to learn something and actually having access to education. I completely agree that we&#x27;re living at a time when anyone with a decent laptop and internet connection has access to the basic required materials, but learning something from scratch with minimal guidance is difficult, and the huge amount of mythologizing around programming has made it even worse.<p>Bootcamps, at least Dev Bootcamp, focus heavily on the mental&#x2F;emotional aspect of this stuff as much as the technical material itself, and do a lot to build the confidence that really is required for many people.<p>And yeah, I do think most companies are primarily incentivized by profits, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t provide a genuine service at the same time.<p>Full disclaimer, I used to work for Udacity and was &quot;trying to make a buck&quot;."
comment,14277281,,,1494023473,,rhapsodic,"<i>&gt;She probably became combative because you were deploying the lump of labour fallacy and in doing so either explicitly or implicitly blaming women working for the failures of economic policy since the 70s.</i><p>That&#x27;s not a valid reason to become combative. If she felt the GP was wrong, she could have simply, with facts and logic, explained why she felt that way.<p>In my observation, when people respond to an argument with combativeness, it usually means they realize they <i>cannot</i> refute the argument with facts and logic. So they get all nasty and start name-calling (e.g. &quot;you&#x27;re a racist!&quot;) or they deploy some childish, imbecilic bromide like accusing the other person of &quot;mansplaining&quot;."
comment,14277278,,,1494023437,,dragonwriter,"&gt; Also, the FSF isn&#x27;t arguing for abolishing copyright, merely reducing its term.<p>Sure, but that&#x27;s immaterial. FSF (and many others; again, this is the fairly explici Constitutional rationale) views copyright bit as a natural right, but as a legal right which is desirable, within certain bounds, because managed properly it can produce certain public benefits.<p>This is at odds with your apparent view that copyright is a <i>natural right</i>.<p>&gt; The source code isn&#x27;t being published to begin with, so all of the usual arguments regarding length of copyright protection are kind of meaningless.<p>The lack of publication actually doesn&#x27;t render the arguments for time limitations moot, only the argument that copyright in such works provides a public benefit (though that can be remedied by altering the terms of mandatory deposit to apply, instead of within a set time after publication, to apply within a set time after creation, and to adopt as a consequence of deposit failure forfeiture of copyright.)"

comment,14277269,,,1494023267,,primitivesuave,"I have run an organization that teaches kids to code and advocates for coding literacy for the last 5 years, and I agree with you that kids as young as 8 years old can absorb a text-based language when presented in the right way. However, typing speeds are generally quite slow amongst elementary school kids, so the rate at which they can make interesting things happen is much slower. That initial dopamine rush when connecting Scratch blocks is a very effective way to get them to see programming as an exciting and fulfilling endeavor. By eliminating the possibility of syntax errors through block-based languages, you can put their entire initial focus on semantics, without having to divert their attention toward syntactical correctness.<p>Also, it takes a certain kind of computer scientist to teach computer science effectively, and most elementary school teachers do not match that requirement no matter how much PD you give them. I would say most elementary school teachers can&#x27;t handle much beyond the basics of Scratch, but that is more than enough to get the platform in the hands of kids. If the teachers chooses to just let the kids mess around with Scratch rather than give them structure and clearly defined goals, they will still do just fine. If a teacher takes a similar lax approach with typed programming, the kids will most likely learn nothing at all, and will often develop an aversion to programming altogether.<p>But I completely agree with you on the importance of teaching typed programming. My heart aches when I hear of middle school CS classes using Scratch. That&#x27;s the perfect age to start exposing kids to Arduinos, Python, Raspberry Pi, etc. The BBC Microbit foundation has been doing a great job in the UK bridging the gap between Scratch and typed programming with their Microbit platform (microbit.org), and (shameless self-plug) I work on this problem as well with techlabeducation.com and pythonroom.com.<p>I think what kids miss most of all from typed programming is the idea that a language is just like a human language, where each language has its own metaphors and way of thinking (an idea put forth by Seymour Papert in his 1998 paper &quot;Mindstorms&quot;)."

From my experience you need to show them that it&#x27;s the company culture to challenge things in a smart and constructive way. To do that, you do nothing very formal, just sit your best guys with the newcomer, explaining how things works and why. And sometimes, criticizing the current stuff, but not in a authoritarian way - something like we know we can do better, just nothing really worked well or we didn&#x27;t have time but now we do.<p>That way it feels much more like -&gt; we have something we could do better, and the guys are trying to improve that, let&#x27;s do that with them.

But in Ethereum, you could unload a huge number of ETH and the price wouldn&#x27;t budge. I&#x27;m assuming of course you&#x27;re not an institutional trader, in which case of course Ethereum trading volumes are insufficient to absorb large trades without significant price movements.<p>&gt;Smart contracts are seriously entirely useless unless you solve oracles.<p>Even a basic cryptocurrency transaction (sending ETH from Account 1 to Account 2) utilizes smart contracts.

Success rates vary. Often there are better ways than RICO. And, also, most cases never make it to court.<p>Basically, prosecutors choose the charges they seek to prosecute based on their judgement of the likelihood of conviction; RICO can effectively multiply the number of charges...which some judges are less keen on. There are many factors at play with RICO, but they won&#x27;t clarify anything, so I&#x27;ll leave it there.<p>It is certainly not clear that the DoJ will even prosecute Uber under RICO. Its a possibility, but perhaps not the most likely approach, for a variety of reasons.  That said, its far from impossible. And, some USAs use RICO more than others (eg Preet Bharara).<p>Long story short: criminal investigations &amp; charges are the issue, more than whether they are charged under RICO.

It was an almost perfect storm of young men coming home and others coming of age from the post WW2 era baby boom (1960s, early 70s), and the US inheriting manufacturing dominance which was ideal for employing blue-collar men."

comment,14277053,,,1494020725,,paulmd,"&gt;  What do you think about the idea that people in failed states with unstable currencies would want to store their wealth in Bitcoin?<p>It&#x27;s a stupid idea because there&#x27;s always two parties to any transaction.<p>You know why they don&#x27;t just store their wealth in dollars?  Because nobody is insane enough to sell them dollars for a worthless piece of paper.<p>Bitcoin works the same way.  How much Bitcoin would you give for a Zimbabwe Dollar during hyperinflation?  Obviously none.<p>So you have yet another hard currency that nobody can get ahold of.  What&#x27;s the point, again?<p>&gt;  Or the idea that people would want to use it for international money transfers?<p>I buy things internationally all the time.  It works pretty great, it costs me nothing and it costs the recipient 4.4% plus a fixed $0.30 per sale.<p>Plus if they try and screw me over somehow I get all my money back and try someone else, and they get slapped with a big-ass chargeback fee for being an asshole.  How much are the chargeback fees in the Bitcoin model?  Who do I call to get my money back?<p>Also, I can tell you for sure that Bitcoin costs quite a lot in fees to buy, sell, or trade.  Each transaction is what, $0.50 in fees nowadays?<p>Insofar as Bitcoin represents a single world currency, the problem is that on a macro level this isn&#x27;t a good idea.  Separate currencies that can inflate&#x2F;deflate (i.e. &quot;appreciate&quot; and &quot;depreciate&quot;) are a way to levellize structural imbalances, and without this relief valve you can end up with total collapse instead of just workers who are upset that an iPhone costs $1000.  Inflation is good, it reflects a growing economy, it&#x27;s only when it turns into hyperinflation that this is problematic.<p>For a microcosm of this problem, you can see the ongoing problems with the structural imbalances between Greece and the high-earning German economies over the last 10 years.  If they had currencies that could appreciate and depreciate, Greek labor would be very cheap on the international market.  But since they&#x27;re stuck in the Euro together, they can&#x27;t do that.<p>The growth function for the money supply probably isn&#x27;t optimal either, for these reasons.  The ability to adjust the supply is critical for controlling both inflation and deflation, under various circumstances."

comment,14276867,,,1494018560,,Animats,"We&#x27;ve seen this unsubstantiated denial before on YC, at &quot;Why I’m dropping Rust&quot;[1] and &quot;Rust sucks if I fail to write X&quot;.[2] I once started going through the Rust library packages and listed uses of &quot;unsafe&quot;.  Try doing that.<p>The previous discussions made a few things clear:<p>- The big design-level problems with data structure safety are 1) partially initialized arrays, and 2) backlinks.  The first is needed for growing arrays in Vec, and the second is needed for doubly-linked lists and some kinds of trees.  It&#x27;s very hard to handle either of those in safe Rust. A very small number of packages need unsafe code for those functions, and those should be tightly controlled.<p>- Foreign code remains a problem, and is inherently unsafe when calling unsafe languages. The most downloaded Rust crate is &quot;libc&quot;. What could possibly go wrong there?  Was it really a good idea to import unsafe &quot;strcpy&quot; into Rust?<p><pre><code>    pub fn strcpy(dst: *mut c_char, src: *const c_char) -&gt; *mut c_char;
</code></pre>
- There&#x27;s a lot of use of &quot;unsafe&quot; code that&#x27;s not strictly necessary.
You find unsafe code like &quot;from_utf8_unchecked&quot;, which then turns up in the JSON decoder at (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang-deprecated&#x2F;rustc-serialize&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;json.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang-deprecated&#x2F;rustc-serialize&#x2F;blob...</a>). There are no comments on the safety of that. Is there some way to create bad JSON, get bad UTF-8 into a string, and cause trouble further upstream? I don&#x27;t know, but somebody &quot;optimized&quot; there, and created a potential problem.<p>I could give many more examples.<p>Most of these problems are fixable. They&#x27;re not inherent in Rust.  Fixing them is important to Rust&#x27;s credibility. If Rust is going to replace C++, which it should, the holes have to be plugged. 
It only takes one hole to create a security vulnerability.<p>Denial is not a river in Egypt.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12474445"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12474445</a>

comment,14276864,,,1494018518,,toufka,"Not really.  A single organism (outside of the human race) cannot call the full force of an entire &#x27;environment&#x27; against another species.  And species (outside of humans) must abide by natural laws of energy transfer - for every advance there is an energetic tradeoff. The more different the organism is the easier it would be to target with drugs that only target precisely those differences. The less different, the easier our own bodies would work on it. The more lethal it was, the less it would spread.  The less lethal, the more time there would be to figure it out.  Without bringing to bear the force of an environmental change (shifting the equilibrium or set-point), there is very little that could be biologically catastrophic for the human race.<p>That is not to say that a virulent plague would not be a bad thing for a lot of individuals, if not the human species - but it&#x27;d be pretty challenging to even design worse than already exist out there - HIV, ebola, marburg or smallpox."

You stil have to check the docs&#x2F;source what exactly happens, but it is just one simple function instead of magic methods. And i can keep using plain dicts everywhere.<p>EDIT: To clarify a bit.

comment,14276798,,,1494017907,,eridius,"Sounds to me like the unsafe block had the wrong scope. If safe Rust called a function with a buffer, and that buffer was too small, and that function internally used unsafe code to write to the buffer, then that function is leaking the unsafety past the `unsafe {}` scope, which is incorrect. So that function should be marked as `unsafe`, and the calling code (which calculates the buffer) is then responsible for ensuring that it&#x27;s invoking the unsafe function with an appropriately-sized buffer."

comment,14276714,,,1494017137,,comex,"The main reason it requires unsafe is for memory layout optimizations.  Logically, a hash table is an array of buckets, each of which is either a (hash, key, value) triplet or empty.  The naive representation would be Vec&lt;Option&lt;(usize, K, V)&gt;&gt;, but using Option would significantly increase the size of each bucket: it&#x27;s only a one-byte tag to differentiate between Some and None, but alignment constraints would round the overhead up to at least the alignment of usize, typically 8.  Instead, HashMap stores just (usize, K, V), and considers a bucket empty whenever 0 is stored in the hash slot; if 0 ever comes up as an actual hash value, it&#x27;s changed to a different value before being stored.<p>To the extent I&#x27;ve described it, that <i>might</i> be possible to accomplish in Rust without unsafe code, using a safe abstraction around NonZero (an unsafe type which the compiler assumes will never be zero, allowing it to automatically use a zero value as a marker if the type is found in an enum, such as Option).  However, HashMap goes a step further: it actually stores all the hashes contiguously in one array, and the (K, V) pairs in another.  The nth index in the hashes array and in the (K, V) array together represent a single bucket, but storing them separately makes HashMap&#x27;s typical access patterns somewhat nicer on the CPU&#x27;s cache.  However, this means that slots in the (K, V) array can contain either valid data (of arbitrary types, which might contain pointers etc.) or garbage, depending on a value stored somewhere completely different.  There&#x27;s no good &#x27;automatic&#x27; way to make that safe.<p>I think the use of unsafe code here is fine - it&#x27;s not that hard to audit, and if you don&#x27;t audit you&#x27;re in trouble anyway (hash table DoS is also a security risk) - but in the long term, it would be very interesting if Rust could integrate an optional theorem prover, with the ability to prove arbitrarily complex code safe, given sufficient annotations..."

comment,14276690,,,1494016941,,erikpukinskis,"PHP uses an imperative programming model and has a very clear URL-&gt;source file mapping. This means you can look at the URL, find the source file, start at the top and trace your way to the problem.<p>Node (and Rails, and Java and lots of others) use a declarative router. The app boots. Shit happens. Routes exist. Middleware is involved. There&#x27;s no way to know what code is implicated in a given URL.<p>If you&#x27;re a pro and you can afford to spend a year or so learning framework internals while not getting much done, you develop a sixth sense for where in the codebase an error is likely to be, but you need to spend many weeks and months scratching your head to get there.<p>PHP is much more beginner friendly in this way."

If you could find the port or the phone number and you could guess a username, such as oh I don&#x27;t know: &quot;root&quot;, then you could get in.<p>And people were. We were regularly getting modem calls after hours. We had medical records, private financial data, social insurance numbers, ...<p>It was such a painful work environment. I switched us over by claiming that OpenServer 6 did not have a telnet server and that we were going to have to switch to SSH.

The reason is: the musician is paying the manager, the employee is not.<p>It&#x27;s the chief officers who are paying for the manager.  A manager&#x27;s job is the manage the issues of the officers.  They pay the his or her salary.  The way companies manage employees is to flat out lie about that relationship.

People who believe their culture is the exception that causes employees to be honest with their superiors are naive.<p>What generally happens with strong technical employees is this. While they&#x27;re idealistic and new, they will be relatively honest and direct (simultaneously trying to be polite) for the first couple of years. After a while, they will try to figure out why they&#x27;ve been forced out from their company every 6 months.<p>It will click that maybe the boss didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> mean it when he asked for an inventory of problems and concerns. Maybe all those people who smiled and nodded while a technical &quot;debate&quot; was going on were secretly developing resentment. Maybe people disliked them because their behaviors were interpreted as snobby, arrogant, insensitive, condescending, or detached, despite the politeness with which they delivered their opinions.<p>Then, they will either a) nope out of the career track entirely and become a consultant&#x2F;freelancer&#x2F;entrepreneur; b) lie to themselves and believe they can find the magical land where this doesn&#x27;t happen, which only sets up for a harder fall down the line when you realize no such magical place exists, because people are people everywhere; or c) embrace the realities of human collaboration and try to raise a successful career from the ashes.<p>I&#x27;ve done both A and B. A usually loops back around to a full-time gig at some point. Some people will remain unaware and try to believe in B for the duration of their career. When you exit denial from B, you have to embrace C (even if you loop back to A, C is informative for your ongoing ventures)."

It&#x27;s definitely high-level<p>I agree that it is &quot;high level&quot; and glosses over (purposefully) the nitty-gritty details of the &quot;black boxes&quot; for the most part. I say this as someone who took the first incarnation of the course, which was known as &quot;ML Class&quot; in the fall of 2011, before Coursera came about.<p>Despite it being high-level, though - this is what one of my &quot;classmates&quot; was able to create, about halfway or so thru the course:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.davidsingleton.org&#x2F;nnrccar&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.davidsingleton.org&#x2F;nnrccar&#x2F;</a><p>In 2012, I completed Udacity&#x27;s CS373 course (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;artificial-intelligence-for-r...</a>).<p>Today, I&#x27;m currently in the second term of Udacity&#x27;s Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree (the current lesson I&#x27;m on actually is a part of CS373 - so it&#x27;s a kind of review lesson for me - heh). I&#x27;m having a great time learning about more in-depth understanding and knowledge relating to self-driving vehicles. Much of the learning can be applied to other areas of ML as well (learning how to use and abuse TensorFlow and Keras, for instance).<p>&gt; A big shift in career, from software engineer to &#x27;data scientist (or whatever they call it)&#x27; is probably not possible at my advanced age (37).<p>Don&#x27;t let that stop ya! My plan after finishing this Udacity course is to actually work toward getting my BS and maybe MS in Comp Sci. By that time, I&#x27;ll be well into my 44th year of age. I don&#x27;t know if any of this will lead to a different direction in my career, but that isn&#x27;t something I am really worried or planning about. I&#x27;m currently happy with where my career is; it pays the bills and allows for some fun, too. But if it should lead in another direction, so be it! I figure having this knowledge can&#x27;t hurt me as a employment candidate, and will likely be seen as a plus. Worst case scenario, it will make my hobbyist robotics projects more interesting.<p>I figure I have another 20 or more years in me doing software development (assuming it remains a career option, of course); I personally have met more that a few other developers that age or older who are still making a living at it. So I&#x27;m not ruling out the possibility of a lateral move toward something involving my knowledge of machine learning.<p>Good luck with your studies!"

I think if you get more clear about what you&#x27;re expecting from Penrose you&#x27;ll have a better foothold for why you&#x27;re not getting what you&#x27;re expecting.<p>It does make sense that our ability to understand the incompleteness theorem is very close to self-contradictory -- I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d say it is, without a doubt, self-contradictory; I have not dove deep into how provability logics might force □(a → (p ∧ ¬□p)) into a contradiction, and what you need for that (possibly with reasonable axioms it merely derives ¬□a which just means that if there is an algorithm for understanding then we&#x27;ll never uncover it?).<p>QM does not by itself plug the hole in our understanding; Penrose has never said that to my knowledge. However a tiny part of quantum physics is the only known part of physics that&#x27;s capable of producing nonalgorithmic results (the vast majority of QM is linear algebra in funny hats), hence if we&#x27;ve got a nonalgorithmic result it makes sense to follow our &quot;best theories so far&quot; towards that tiny part of quantum physics."

Most people are living better lives today in the era of High Capitalism than they ever have in the past. As technology growth - spurred by the incentives capitalism generates - continues, and new products and services are created by the capitalist system, people&#x27;s lives will continue to improve.<p>What&#x27;s beautiful about capitalism is that it, through automation, is eliminating drudgery and danger from people&#x27;s work. Eventually when we reach very high levels of automation in society, we may be able to transition to an economy in which people don&#x27;t have to work (much) but still get to own things through universal basic income or some other sort of scheme.<p>So no revolution needed to get us to the promised land folks.

comment,14276249,,,1494013346,,jamesisaac,"I&#x27;d highly recommend using a type system like Flow to enumerate the shape of possible actions the store should support. This brings numerous advantages:<p>1. You can use strings for action types, no more need to import constants.<p>2. No need for action creators for simple actions, you can just create the action object inline and Flow will validate its shape.<p>3. You can be sure that reducers are unpacking properties that actually exist from the actions.<p>In other words, your example could simply be:<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;&#x2F; types.js
    type Action =
      | { type: &#x27;ADD_TODO&#x27;, text: string }

    &#x2F;&#x2F; TodoList.js
    dispatch({ type: &#x27;ADD_TODO&#x27;, text })
</code></pre>
...and Flow would confirm at &#x27;compile time&#x27; that it matches the contract dispatch expects.<p>This approach has scaled up extremely well for me and no longer feels verbose."

I put quotes around science for a reason, because I have a specific example, to wit:<p>Think about alchemy. To a certain extent, a form of scientific process was used by these early - for lack of a better word - proto-chemists. They pondered, came up with ideas, experimented, took notes, compared results, etc. They discovered new substances and compounds we use to this day; they created the prototypes of some of the lab equipment still used. Their methods ultimately led to our current &quot;scientific method&quot; of inquiry.<p>But despite their successes and failures, despite their best attempts and experiments, in many ways they were hampered by the framework of &quot;science&quot; they were investigating. For instance, they knew little to nothing about atoms or elements - instead grouping things into the &quot;classical&quot; elements of earth, fire, water, and air (and in some cases &quot;spirit&quot;). They still had a mindset of &quot;like for like&quot;, meaning that their experimentation led to them using substances or similar that had some nature which was like what they were attempting to perform or gain the result of.<p>I won&#x27;t belabour this point - only to say that because their framework of reference limited them, they couldn&#x27;t make the &quot;giant leap&quot; forward that was needed to really understand and do what it is they were trying to do (let&#x27;s not dwell on the philosophical&#x2F;spiritual aspects of the so-called Philosopher&#x27;s Stone quest).<p>So perhaps that&#x27;s where we are today, in regards to science and trying to explain and understand consciousness? That isn&#x27;t to say we won&#x27;t eventually be able to explain and explore the topic; our nature of asking questions, trying experiments, coming at the problem from a myriad of different angles, and the collaboration between these disparate fields will likely lead us to the knowledge (and also it will open up many more questions, as it always has and does). As noted in the article, we are taking more steps even today - and I am also pleased to see that there is a greater collaboration going on between the fields and people who deal with this at a basic level - the physicists, the neuroscientists, computer science, biologists, etc. This kind of cross-fertilization is absolutely needed in order to understand this problem."

And when I do need to be more mobile, phones handle that aspect just as well and maybe better if I need to be able to put said mobile device is a smaller-than-tablet-pocket. I think in the long term, the extent of tablets will largely be some kind of pseudo-tablet convertibles like the aforementioned ZenBook and probably fewer like the Transformer of the Surface Book and most tablets that do stick around with be Surface like holdouts that can&#x27;t more easily be converted into real computer mode."

comment,14276165,,,1494012571,,eridius,"An &quot;open&quot; platform is still a platform with lock-in. The only thing &quot;open&quot; does is allow other vendors to decide if they want to support that platform too. But, for example, you can&#x27;t take a web site and use it on a platform that doesn&#x27;t support web pages (e.g. you can&#x27;t browse the web on an AppleTV).<p>&gt; <i>Problem with Apple and MS is that they use the later on purpose.</i><p>There are really significant downsides to open platforms. They&#x27;re harder to build, develop <i>much</i> more slowly, generally have a big issue with multiple implementations not actually behaving identically (just look at the development of the web for a plethora of examples), end up being design-by-committee which usually ends up as a worst-of-all-worlds design, etc. Companies like Apple and MS build closed platforms because that ends up being <i>hugely</i> better for their users. They don&#x27;t do this out of a desire to have lock-in, lock-in is just a natural consequence of using closed platforms."

Compartmentalization helps this somewhat, even if it initially looks like the opposite.<p>You can still build a hot rod without too much advanced knowledge.  Want to include anti-lock brakes?  What about traction control?  What about variable valve timing?  At some point even the savants will start acquiring whole systems to drop in as needed, as needed.  Systemd is to sysinit what a brand new aluminum or magnesium alloy modern engine is to a 70&#x27;s cast iron engine.  It&#x27;s not something you want to mess with too much, and it has a bunch of inputs and outputs you probably don&#x27;t care about, but it&#x27;s designed for what it&#x27;s used for.  If I was buying a new car, I want the modern engine unless I expect to need to do a bunch of maintenance myself.<p>This is the normal progression technology takes.  It&#x27;s fine to still run your own distro, just as it&#x27;s fine to build your own car, but let&#x27;s not delude ourselves into thinking the custom distro not the hot rod are just as good <i>general purpose</i> devices, even if they may well be better for a specific subset of things (and that subset may well fit what you care about)."

comment,14275742,,,1494009391,,psadauskas,"My 2012 MBP is getting a bit long in the tooth, and had several software-ish issues that were totally unfixable. As a long time Linux user, I decided to switch back, and purchased a powerful laptop to replace it. I did a similar survey of distros, and haven&#x27;t been happy with any of them.<p>Ubuntu worked fairly well in a vanilla configuration, but as a developer, I prefer a more powerful and customizable desktop UI. My preferred window manager is awesomewm, but trying to get it to integrate with Unity or Gnome-shell is pretty much impossible. If I run just bare awesome, I lose all the power management &amp; audio niceties. I can probably set it all back up, but documentation on how to do so is slim. Additionally, installing newer software than what is provided by apt is a giant pain. You basically have to hope the vendor provides their own apt repository for you to use, and that they&#x27;ve updated it for Zesty.<p>Arch linux was by far my favorite before I switched to OSX ~10 years ago. It always has the latest software available in core. Additionally, AUR provides betas and even more esoteric software. Anything I come across here or on reddit probably already has an AUR package for it, and in the rare case it does not, it is trivial to write a PKGBUILD for it. However, installing Arch is way harder than it used to be, particularly on laptops. There&#x27;s so much variety and complexity in hardware now, you could spend a month getting everything set up and it still would not be satisfactory. Power management, sound, full-disk-encryption, webcam, display hot-plugging, hardware sensors...<p>I used Fedora for quite awhile on a desktop before I got this laptop, and really enjoyed it. However, the latest Fedora uses wayland for everything, which doesn&#x27;t work with the closed nvidia drivers, and nouveau on the 1070 in this laptop basically doesn&#x27;t work. However, `dnf` is 10x better than `apt`, and I found it much easier to find copr repositories for updated software. Maybe I&#x27;ll revisit once wayland and nvidia work together.<p>I wish there was a distro half-way in between Arch and Ubuntu&#x2F;Fedora. A nice installer that autodetects and sets up hardware automatically, but still easy to hack on. The problem with the former, though, is you pretty much need the resources of Canonical or Red Hat to get it done.<p>Also, for the record, I love systemd. I&#x27;ve been using unixes for 20 years, and never managed to grok init scripts that I was comfortable creating or modifying them. Systemd (like Upstart and Launchd before it) is a huge improvement over that mess."

I think it&#x27;s less about the choice of tool, and more about designers who know what&#x27;s possible in HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. I think that HTML mockups are valuable (especially for reusing components and experimenting with interactivity and responsiveness), but Photoshop and Illustrator provide speed of experimentation that HTML&#x2F;CSS is miles away from. Blocking out layouts and text in illustrator is mechanically trivial, and requires little planning - with HTML I need to actually plan out how my flexboxes and HTML structures are going to work out, and that just slows down experimentation and iteration.<p>Personally, I start in Illustrator, then move into HTML as the designs solidify. My Illustrator mockups are nearly identical to my HTML because I understand the limitations I&#x27;m working with (or psuedo limitations, since you can do most anything with SVG - but it might be a pain in the ass)."

comment,14275697,,,1494009045,,raulk,"JBI déjà vu. I see some parallelism between this JSR and the Java Business Integration (JBI, JSR-208) JSR back in 2005.<p>Instead of building a standard for integration, they ended up specifying a standard for interoperability between integration components from different vendors, i.e. a &quot;meta&quot;-integration system (using the same term as the author).<p>The result was a spec that allowed an (a) HTTP adapter from Oracle to exchange data with a (b) File adapter from IBM – through (c) an ESB implemented by TIBCO, for example. Essentially something that nobody would even think of deploying (in the era of proprietary, expensive and lock-in middleware).<p>Obviously the standard was DOA and had very little traction. Not even the JSR members implemented it. The only memorable implementation was Apache ServiceMix, which later transitioned to OSGi, spinning off its kernel as Apache Karaf.<p>In hindsight, the vendors might have acted like trojan horses with JBI, steering the spec into a territory that would be ultimately worthless.<p>The lesson to learn is that commercial vendors don&#x27;t gain anything by standardising on those elements they consider strategic differentiators (like their module system).<p>EDIT: minor edits for clarity."

comment,14275610,,,1494008409,,Sir_Cmpwn,"&gt;I have 878 unique shared libraries shared between currently running processes on my Linux laptop at this moment, with the amount of processes sharing a library ranging from 2 processes to 820. Most may have few in common, but there are a lot of them, and the mean is 62, mode is 4.<p>Good god, this tells half the story. An agunix install booted to a shell will typically only have 3 processes running: runit, a getty, and your shell. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> had more than 50 processes running on my agunix system at any given moment.<p>&gt;As far as the botched update argument: When does anybody botch an update of a shared library? When they&#x27;re forcing something to install, or they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>For any number of reasons. This has happened to me dozens of times in the past year. You also run into issues with any software you compiled yourself that aren&#x27;t managed by the package manager (or at least not supported by your distro). You know what&#x27;s better? An executable that works on any Linux system and will continue to work for the next 20 years without any changes. How about running two executables that need different versions of a library?<p>&gt;On the other hand, mis-matches in applications using different versions of the same code causes silent, unexpected, difficult to debug errors.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into this yet. Have you?<p>&gt;I&#x27;d also be interested in seeing actual &quot;RAM and disk footprint&quot; numbers as a comparison for the same applications and libraries, because that doesn&#x27;t really make sense. Even if applications only copy a couple small functions each, they add up, whereas the shared library only has one copy.<p>My laptop is currently running runit, 8 gettys, sshd, wpa_supplicant, crond, udevd, and dhcpcd. It&#x27;s using 60 MiB of RAM. So far as disk footprint is concerned, see package sizes at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repo.agunix.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repo.agunix.org&#x2F;</a>. Base system is ~350 MiB on disk and there&#x27;s still room for improvement.<p>From the agunix home page:<p>&gt;Our first concern is to build a lightweight POSIX environment - a familiar design for users familiar with other Linux distributions is not our goal.<p>It&#x27;s better to think of this as a new operating system entirely than as a new Linux distro."

Although late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia, early deaths exhibited extremely “wet,” sometimes hemorrhagic lungs. The hypothesis presented herein is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0–31.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33% and 3% of recipients, respectively. Recently, pulmonary edema was found at autopsy in 46% of 26 salicylate-intoxicated adults. Experimentally, salicylates increase lung fluid and protein levels and impair mucociliary clearance. In 1918, the US Surgeon General, the US Navy, and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended use of aspirin just before the October death spike. If these recommendations were followed, and if pulmonary edema occurred in 3% of persons, a significant proportion of the deaths may be attributable to aspirin.&quot;

But if multiple components in various parts of your app are making similar kinds of calls, it makes sense to manage it centrally, with a file or set of files that can handle common actions."

comment,14275526,,,1494007734,,nugget,"I am a fan of Ethereum but I wish they (and other alt-coins) would be honest about the fact that there is very much a central authority at work; in Ethereum&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s a small network of developers and mining pools.  That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but let&#x27;s at least be honest about it. 
 Admit that central authorities have a role to play (and may take many different forms).  Recent events clearly reflect, to me at least, that the value of a blockchain doesn&#x27;t depend upon the lack of a central authority (indeed, investors may feel safer with a steady hand on the wheel) or immutability (Ethereum violated supposed rule #1 and look at how the market has voted, i.e. ETH&#x2F;ETC price variance)."

comment,14275475,,,1494007346,,zimablue,"I can think of a couple of reasons:
    safety, attr access by .&lt;thing&gt; means you knew what you wanted at write-time, so it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that you&#x27;re gonna want to know if it doesn&#x27;t exist, and not just want to roll the dice on passing a null along.
    language concision, it seems counterintuitive but attrs vs items gives you two options for one class: . access and [] access, which it&#x27;s very reasonable give different results, so your default mode of writing classes has a &quot;I think this should be here&#x2F;nondynamic&quot; mode of access and a &#x27;wonder if this is here&#x27;&#x2F;dynamic mode of access. I think that there are benefits to that. If you don&#x27;t eventually do some dynamic attribute access I think you throw away an advantage of dynamic languages, but it&#x27;s nice to me that there&#x27;s this by default soft line between less and more dynamic code"

But I actually don&#x27;t like any of the regulations you mentioned.<p>The most egregious is this one:<p><i>cab drivers from city A may drive passengers to city B, but not pick up passengers in city B. Once again, this is not just to protect taxi drivers in city B (because the meter in taxi A may have lower tariffs), but also to ensure a competent driver for passengers in city B.</i><p>This is almost always a rule to protect cab drivers in city B.  And it&#x27;s horribly inefficient as it means the cab spends 50% of its time empty.  If driving between cities is common, fares have to be much, much higher to compensate drivers for this.<p>Knowledge of local roads is close to ok, it ties into being a good driver.  The other items on your list are nice-to-haves, but at what cost?  If tourists really want all this stuff, they can take the cab at the stand outside their hotel or at the airport instead of calling an Uber.  But, speaking for myself, I&#x27;d prefer to save 10-20 euro on a trip from the airport.<p>Disclaimer: the closest I have come to Germany is flying through the airports.

Apologies for the late reply, I also have a day job ;)<p>I would recommend Krugman&#x27;s Conscience of a Liberal for an entertaining read. He referenced another book, aptly called Inequality[1], which I&#x27;m currently going through. Its a little more academic prose so its not something I can finish quickly (in short, its not an entertaining read...not that all books have to be of course).<p>Both of these books examine historical precedents for income inequality and attempt to analyze the current situation as well. I think they did a fair job, although I am open to change my mind if there is a better explanation. But these and other books, such as Dark Money[2], and just general news about the scummy activities of people like the Koch brothers have made me more convinced of this viewpoint.<p>Now to address your comment...<p>&gt; Only a minority of companies in the US even have executives that get the much maligned high pay and bonuses in the last decade or so. What about the massive percentage of wealth that didn&#x27;t fall into this category? They may have gain significantly from globalism but that was hardly the result of US tax policy alone.<p>This is most certainly not true [0]. From [0] and from Krugman&#x27;s book, you can see just how much the changes in tax policy has incentivized ballooning executive pay and created a new class of executives, who may not be as rich as the landed&#x2F;inherited, but are certainly &quot;rich&quot;. And this class has grown and become more enriched due to globalism, the opening of foreign markets and plummeting of labor costs, both due to automation and cheap foreign labor. I almost think of it as a weird form of trickle down effect, where most of the wealth goes to the very rich but a little (relatively insignificant but in absolute terms very much so) trickles down to the executive class.<p>&gt; Lets not forget that democrats were in power for the last 8yrs and the state has only grown exponentially since the 1990s under both republican and democrat governments. Just because tax rates weren&#x27;t the extremes of pre-1980&#x2F;1970s doesn&#x27;t make them low. They&#x27;ve been relatively consistent while the middle class income dropped.<p>Yes Democrats were in power for 8 years but how many of their policies could not be enacted due to obstructionism? But lets not get into that area here: 8 years is a relatively small time to create&#x2F;destroy inequality. And I don&#x27;t see any Democrats pushing for tax cuts on the rich, especially cutting estate taxes, which affect only the very rich.<p>&gt; The complexity of the tax code and lack of competitiveness with international countries may have heavily influenced inequality. But it was hardly the result of explicit tax reduction for the rich...<p>Its not the complexity of the tax code but its very nature. The top tax rate for personal income is around 35% in the US whereas it is much higher in other developed economies. And the sources that I&#x27;ve listed point to historical trends that prove the same point: once you have a class of super wealthy, they will inevitably influence the Government to reduce their tax burden no matter how that is achieved.<p>&gt; The idea that tax havens are something that were merely a matter of weak policy is naive. Even worse than the drug war hawks.<p>I don&#x27;t think that comparison achieves anything but hyperbole so I&#x27;m not going to comment on it.<p>&gt; Just because the middle class didn&#x27;t keep pace with the wealthy doesn&#x27;t mean only the wealthy were at fault. The fact the middle class lost wealth is hardly singularly the fault of the wealthy. I know this narrative sells well in politics but it&#x27;s very short sighted.<p>I think you&#x27;re conflating wealth with income. The middle class, by their definition, is not wealthy (at least in the same country; middle class in US is most certainly <i>more</i> wealthy than in India, say). The US middle class hasn&#x27;t lost wealth, its their incomes that have not been growing as fast as the incomes of the wealthy. Its unfortunately not just politics: investments in people reap great benefits for society. If a country fails to invest in the health and education of its citizenry because its unable to raise the revenue to do so by the wealthy, then its most certainly the fault of the rich.<p>&gt; Even if the US adjusted tax policy to redistribute a larger chunk of taxes towards the middle class it would hardly make a dent in the new reality in the fact there is hardly a middle class economy like there used to be. So you must either develop a new middle class economy or you get temporary perks of taking it from the wealthy. This is the big whale in the room that the Bernie bro guys are ignoring. The likely scenario is that the wealthy would become continually less competitive over the years, shift way more money over seas, and the middle class would be in the same situation with a little bit more money for a short period.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is likely. Sure its a changed reality now, and I certainly don&#x27;t see what other future markets will open up, but this new reality demands a healthy, educated workforce to operate it. Income redistribution is less about taking from wealthy and giving it to the poor as much as taking from the wealthy and investing in institutions&#x2F;programs that can assist the most vulnerable in society. More taxation by itself won&#x27;t make the wealthy less competitive... I mean, how does that even happen? On the contrary: educating a kid from Inner City Detroit might give us the next Steve Jobs.<p>&gt; Gov spending under any administration that enacts those policies would largely offset most of the gains going directly to the people regardless (which is good if it results in universal health care, but little else if it&#x27;s not sustainable).<p>You seem to imply that all Govt. spending is wasteful which is most certainly not true. Surely its not perfect, but that&#x27;s another problem that needs fixing.<p>Also, you asked for a source but failed to provide a single one for any of the many many assertions that you have made.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pay-without-Performance-Unfulfilled-Compensation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0674022289"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pay-without-Performance-Unfulfilled-C...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Inequality-What-Can-Be-Done&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0674504763"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Inequality-What-Can-Be-Done&#x2F;dp&#x2F;067450...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307947904"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radic...</a>"
comment,14275337,,,1494006476,,merb,"&gt; Should we further delay this JSR—possibly for years—in order to gain “closer consensus” by pursuing a different goal that will likely result in a design so bloated and complex that no working developer would ever use it<p>this.
I don&#x27;t see a reason to even delay Java 9 more. It&#x27;s really really really silly. Yes no solution is perfect, but most of the time when somebody want to make something perfect and actually implement everything for everybody, they fail or it ends up in super complicated stuff.
Java 10 and Java 11 looks promising, maybe more promising than 9 but 9 also has promising things and the module system might emerge into something super useful, if not - is that the end of the world? prolly not.<p>java has a extreme amount of bloat when it comes to releases, even more than the language itself. a lot of it are policits and still I hope that they change their &quot;3-5 years till next release&quot;-model soon! I mean there aren&#x27;t many languages that are developed in the open and have such a aweful time frame.
the best model is prolly used by rust. smaller iterations  and some other channels a la chrome.
it&#x27;s really sad that the language gets so much hindered by akward polictics"

comment,14275286,,,1494006077,,malkia,"1. I&#x27;m trying to be serious, but I often lose touch. My wife is more in control of the matter.<p>2. I&#x27;m not sure teaching is the best way to describe it... more like doing it together, and sharing knowledge. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a good teacher (after seen how others do it). Occasionally I pull real good &quot;teachin&#x27;&quot; - seriously, but then often I fell into too many details, and he gets bored.<p>3. Maybe, but possibly when he goes to middleschool.<p>I grew up in Bulgaria, and since 7th grade I was in specialized Mathematics and Informatics (the &quot;eu&quot; word for &quot;computer science&quot;) high-school. I went there because I was good in my elementary, middle school... only to realize I was just average, or even below compared to the other kids. But then I discovered that programming is what I really wanted, unlike many of the other kids (that was back in the 90s), and there was much less competition in this area. Nowadays its quite different... Back then, even saying that you were playing video games, and kids would consider you dork&#x2F;geek&#x2F;etc.<p>But back to math-specialized high-school - Since I&#x27;ve started doing poorly, my parents got me 1-1 (sometimes 1-2) math teacher, just to keep on level. It was the norm to have 30-40 math exams for homework, and it took everyone of us hours to finish (Though one difference with schools here, is that there is rotation when you go to school - one month you go in the morning, the other month in the afternoon - so there was plenty of time to finish homework).<p>So, it&#x27;s definitely beneficial to have an instructor. It helped me. We are considering, but also from another standpoint - peer pressure. When all our friends are talking about how their kids go with private tutors&#x2F;instructors - then you have to get on that bandwagon... I mean I hate that, but I know we have to do it.<p>Last rant, I wish a classroom where the teacher would have only few kids - 5-6, not 20. I feel this would greatly reduce the need for instructors.<p>And I&#x27;m willing to pay more taxes, whether I had or had not kids."

comment,14275181,,,1494005413,,eximius,I have not because I don&#x27;t write C professionally. We generally have things that require algorithmic improvements due to the scale - language doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>C&#x27;s model requires you to understand the machine model. Haskell presumably requires you to understand the machine model (but less thoroughly) but understand the compiler&#x27;s model also. It&#x27;s a little more but comparable. So complaining only about the Haskell runtime just seems ironic to me.

Parties representing religious groups wanted the start delayed till after Passover and the end to precede Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, while the secular parties would argue for starting it earlier and ending it later.<p>Sounds like business as usual for a modern 2-party state.  What was more interesting to me, as a programmer, was the next line:<p>&gt; In the past, the unpredictability of IDT in Israel became frustrating enough that Microsoft Windows stopped trying to track changes and just made Israeli time be Greenwich Mean Time plus two hours (GMT+2) (and disabled the daylight saving option). This has led to various ad hoc solutions to the problem in Windows systems and other Microsoft software (e.g. Outlook calendar entries are often off by an hour when shared, due to the lack of IDT support). On November 17, 2009, Microsoft released an update that has daylight saving time enabled for Israel. However, the date for transition back to Standard Time is set as the Second Sunday of September, regardless of the Hebrew Calendar date.[4] Windows 7 does contain correct IDT times up to 2023, but not all software makes use of this extra information.<p>OK, I know that I&#x27;m supposed to just import my system date&#x2F;time library for timekeeping functions.  Because it&#x27;s too complicated for mortals like me, while Microsoft, Apple, Google, and other major institutions can handle all the inanities.<p>But Microsoft gave up on this one? Ouch."

But previously you wrote:<p>&gt;<i>and so geothermal plants are generally only built in areas that require shallow (1km) wells</i><p>That sounds like your &quot;30 years&quot; number there is for shallow wells. Intuitively it doesn&#x27;t seem like this logic would necessarily be identical for deeper wells: obviously at some depth the rock is <i>always</i> extremely hot (or, in fact, molten). The article seems to indicate that they expect a deeper well to produce higher temperatures and pressures, in turn allowing more energy production, and that seems like it&#x27;d make sense. Maybe 1km vs 5km makes no difference in lifetime beyond that, but does your analysis include deep wells already in an equivalent area? Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to extrapolate past lifetimes of shallow wells to future lifetimes of deep wells, even ignoring that they say they&#x27;ll be able to achieve far higher energy generation per well."

You can build it from the inside out, or top-down, or bottom-up. You can make it monolithic, or modularize it. You can do all of these things at once, if you want!<p>There was a commercial more than a few years back that illustrated something about &quot;how clients want things done&quot; vs &quot;how things are done&quot; - I think it was for insurance, IIRC. Basically, they showed a &quot;modern construction of a pyramid&quot; in some &quot;city&quot;. It was a complicated construct; but apparently the client wanted it constructed from the top down! So there was this huge gantry crane like system, hanging the apex of the pyramid, and other stuff going on with workers and machines gradually building downward to the base...<p>You can&#x27;t do this physically, of course (though I am aware of people who try to get engineers to do this - it&#x27;s actually a common thing in custom home building for a client to change their mind in the middle of a project and want a window or door moved a few feet over - and trying to get them to understand what that would change in the already-in-place infrastructure of wiring, plumbing, etc - not to mention demolition, re-engineering, permits, inspections, etc - but some clients have enough money and clout and hubris to insist on it).<p>But you can do this with software. When it&#x27;s done in the middle of a project (because of design changes, or to fix issues), we call it refactoring. It is this malleability of software that makes it easier to work with to express complicated constructs; there isn&#x27;t any comparison to physical mechanical systems.<p>Such systems, as exemplified by horological mechanisms, require careful planning of where parts are put for their relative functions, and in relationship to the rest of the device, and how those parts are put together, what order, layers, etc. Not to mention the various calculations and allowances needed for tolerances, forces, friction, lubrication, as well as simply the fasteners and framework holding the whole thing together!<p>We haven&#x27;t even considered taking into account external forces, and how they relate to the accuracy and&#x2F;or longevity of the system. All of these things, and many more, apply to all mechanical systems, and require careful planning and execution. Fortunately (especially for many of these complex timepieces of today, as I am led to believe by the reading of a few of these kinds of articles), master watchmakers like these have at their disposal modern CAD&#x2F;CAM systems to aid them in planning and designing these complex works of art, as well as to guide them in assembly of them. Even with such help, though, I imagine that the process is still a very consuming and maddening one (this is evidenced by the fact of how long it takes for these craftspeople to build only a few of these timepieces). Now imagine having to do this without such help! Not as complex (but still pretty insane given the time period) timepieces (and other mechanical clockwork devices and automata) were planned, design, calculated, drawn, and constructed by hand in the past, long before computers were available - some of which contained thousands of carefully crafted and assembled parts; many of these devices still exist and operate today.<p>Interestingly - very little of our software that we construct today is likely to still be operating 100 or more years from now (though there are a few examples that are working their way to that point)..."

In this project, we are gonna build a game like &quot;Overwatch&quot; using: Unreal Engine 4, Maya, UV Layout, Photoshop, Quixel, Substance Painter 2, Substance Designer. This is going to be a very funny project . if you want to learn how to develop your own game then you are on the right stream.
This tutorial will cover all the details (resources, tools, languages etc) that are necessary to develop a game like Overwatch. You will be guided through all the steps and concepts, starting from the basic ones like setting up the right tools and programs for development. And ultimately you will be able to create your own shooter game like Overwatch.

How to prevent a bomb explodes a day before the deadline?<p>If you discover problems close to the deadline, you already have a big problem. My opinion is that these daily meeting are to prevent problems, like integration between systems.<p>People are comfortable on their own doings, they don&#x27;t like meetings, they prefer a problem occurs and share the blame than doing daily meetings. We must do daily meetings because it&#x27;s good for the project and not because we enjoy it, we do to avoid that some lazy or introvert collaborator don&#x27;t share a problem that can affect everybody.<p>That&#x27;s why we have a scrum master to do the dirty job and assure everyone is talking each other."

That is what is meant by, &quot;Data is the new oil,&quot; - it has nothing to do with the actual perceived or actual value of oil or data, but rather the idea that while it is impossible to compete with these companies. The Economist goes on to state that it is no proponent of trust-busting because, &quot;size is not a crime,&quot; as they put it so therefore we have to regulate the capture of data in different ways."

comment,14274908,,,1494003482,,jsmthrowaway,"That&#x27;s a tough preference with Python, because of the semantics of what [] and . mean and how ingrained those semantics are in the language. Put another way, the following should hold:<p><pre><code>       x.y == x.__getattr__(&quot;y&quot;)
    x[&quot;y&quot;] == x.__getitem__(&quot;y&quot;)
    assignment == set{attr,item}
    del x.y, del x[&quot;y&quot;], etc
    len() and slices of items, not attrs
</code></pre>
etc, etc. If you start messing with those semantics, it can become very confusing very quickly in Python and you probably want a data type. Remember that Python gets nervous about cleverness.<p>One way I&#x27;ve approached your problem before is a recursive helper where I borrowed some concepts from jq:<p><pre><code>    val = fetch(result_dict, &quot;foo.bar.baz.plonk[0]&quot;)
</code></pre>
Because then you can also isolate the missing key handling and all that stuff into your helper, rather than changing the semantics of an untyped dict. Aside from typing the responses from APIs -- the way better option -- I found this a reasonably Pythonic approach toward dealing with the annoyance."

comment,14274803,,,1494002725,,Bumerang,"Having exactly the same background (system programming, linux, c&#x2F;c++, python, never touched Javascript nor web development) I did the very same recently.<p>My solution was to use Django (DRF) for REST API and React for the front-end and Zurb Foundation as UI framework. Javascript is really easy to pick up and there are plenty of tools and tutorials available out there. Used Facebook JS SDK for FB login and sharing (because it&#x27;s easy and ready to go, plus FB is popular enough to make the effort worth). I also used JWT for auth and session management, just to explore it and because it seemed simple enough for my purposes. Django will solve most of the security concerns for you.<p>In total, took me ~4 months while working full time to wrap my head around everything and build the website + deployment (Nginx, Fabric, Celery, supervisor... all the usual stuff)."

If you can&#x27;t buy anything with a currency, it&#x27;s not a currency.&quot;<p>This is the one that really sticks out to me. What do people need any of this for? I think they did a fine job pitching the value of smart contract &#x2F; blockchain technology. But why do I, or a bank, or society need anything beyond those?<p>The tech may be useful, but what 99% of these discussions come down to is whether you think a decentralized currency and disintermediated payments system have value. I don&#x27;t really see the need for the vast majority of society to have the former in the long run, and I think the latter is actively harmful and impractical. Like you pointed out, you&#x27;re inevitably going to have these code failures, disagreements, etc. Those are basic failures of any human-designed and human-negotiated system. As far as those go, I still prefer to wager my business on the time-worn technology of English common law.<p>As far as the tech goes, yes, banks should get behind some of this.

comment,14274695,,,1494002007,,amyjess,"The key is not that your motivation is simply ideological but that it&#x27;s rooted in widely-acknowledged concepts of social justice. And it&#x27;s not even &quot;are you a corporation or are you human?&quot; but &quot;are you fighting for social justice or to line your pockets with cash?&quot;. We can distill that down further to &quot;who benefits more: society or your wallet?&quot;.<p>To steal an example from rayiner elsewhere in this thread, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a restaurant in the segregation-era south in a jurisdiction that requires restaurants to have separate seating areas for white and black people. Let&#x27;s say you decide to break the law by having a single seating area for everyone. That would be civil disobedience because you&#x27;re going out of your way to improve conditions for marginalized people at considerable risk, not just of prosecution but of being boycotted by racists. In other words, you breaking the law benefits society more than it benefits you.<p>This isn&#x27;t what Uber is doing. Sure, let&#x27;s say that Travis is ideologically motivated because he feels he has a fundamental natural right to make money using any and every means he sees fit. So that means Uber is breaking the law because they feel the law gets in the way of their natural right to line their pockets with as much cash as they can however they can. It&#x27;s a purely selfish motivation.<p>And moving on to Ross, it&#x27;s the same thing. He was raking in bitcoins hand over fist from what he was doing. He can say &quot;selling anything should be legal&quot; all he wants, but if the end result of him breaking the law is that he gets rich, then he&#x27;s ultimately doing himself a favor more than he&#x27;s doing society a favor. And he really shot himself in the foot with those attempted hits. That took all the wind out of the sails of his &quot;I&#x27;m not hurting anyone; I&#x27;m just helping connect people to each other&quot;. He tried to kill people. Worse, he tried to kill people <i>because they stole money from him</i>. There was no ideological motivation for the attempted hits. It was just &quot;this guy stole from me, he has to pay&quot;. There goes his entire defense.<p>And ultimately, &quot;civil disobedience&quot; isn&#x27;t a defense against conviction. It&#x27;s an argument for leniency in the sentencing phase. It doesn&#x27;t exist on paper, either: the only reason the concept exists at all is because judges and juries have broad discretion in sentencing. It&#x27;s just like how first-time offenders tend to get off easy: there&#x27;s no law saying &quot;if the convicted has no priors, you have to give them a lesser sentence&quot;, it&#x27;s just based on the logic that someone with no priors is probably someone who made a stupid mistake and not a career criminal. Going back to civil disobedience, the upshot is that if you can convince the judge and&#x2F;or jury that you breaking the law had a net benefit to society, you might get away with the minimum punishment mandated by law. But if the main consequence of you breaking the law is that you got rich, why would any judge or jury care enough to let you off easily?<p>Edit: Just to make this clear, IANAL &amp; TINLA."

Not to mention it also depends on personaility types; you may have an employee who is fairly comfortable answering that sort of question with complete honesty. But more often that not, you will find that they probably haven&#x27;t had chance to get up-to-speed with their work environment or gain a thorough understanding of how the dev team operates.<p>You would probably get more benefit by asking questions that are more related to company culture, such as, how they&#x27;re settling into the team, how they find the team morale&#x2F;company culture, who in the team has provided them the most value so far. Those type of questions would hopefully help the new hire understand that you care about the culture at the company and also helps build a more personal relationship, which consequently will build trust between you and your employees to allow them to truthfully answer your initial question a few months later when they are more embedded into the team.<p>Definitely keep up the regular engagements with new hires though, despite not necessarily receiving the answers you&#x27;re looking for."

Then you resolve the blockage outside of the standup, in a longer, deeper discussion with fewer people.<p>Project tracking should be in a Kanban board (or digital equivalent, such as Jira or TFS). This should be used by the dev&#x27;s so that they know what work is queued up, what work is in process and who&#x27;s working on it, and what is completed, so that they can do their jobs. In an agile team most of the management is externalized onto a Kanban board - the team manages itself most of the time, using the Kanban board to have a shared understanding of what&#x27;s going on. A secondary benefit is that outsiders can look at the Kanban board to assess progress, without consuming any dev time.<p>The &quot;subtle pressure&quot; on the dev to deliver is a great point. In fact, when status is completely transparent, developers put a great deal of pressure on themselves to deliver, because they want to honor their commitments, and there&#x27;s a social pressure not to be &quot;that guy&quot; that blows the sprint."

comment,14274431,,,1494000163,,devrandomguy,"I&#x27;m probably no more knowledgeable than you in this area, but I have a free morning, and this is interesting. My hypothesis, is that the heat that we produce or release to generate usable energy, is an insignificant factor in global warming, compared to the solar heat that we trap with greenhouse gases. Let&#x27;s find some quick simple stats and do some arithmetic, to figure out how much we are directly heating the surface of the Earth.<p>According to Wikipedia, the global energy production for 2012 was about 5.616e+20 joules, or 156 petawatt-hours. The Earth has about 1.386e+21 liters of water on it, and I will assume that that water represents the bulk of the relevant thermal mass, when considering weather patterns and sea level.<p>Now, let&#x27;s estimate the heating caused by that energy. According to www.bickfordscience.com&#x2F;03-05_State_Changes&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;Specific_Heat.pdf, 4,184 Joules of energy applied to 1 KG of water will raise its temperature by 1 degree Celsius, and this scales linearly with mass. Assuming that Earth-water averages out a density of 1 KG per liter, our 5.616e+20 joules, applied over a year to our 1.386e+21 liter water mass, would heat that water by 1.036e-38 degrees Celcius.<p>It has been a while since I&#x27;ve done a dimensional analysis, and the scale here are so extreme that I can&#x27;t tell if my result is sensible. However, if my assumptions are reasonable and my math is correct, and the processes that I have chosen to ignore are insignificant (i.e. radiation into space over one year), then all of the heat that we release in the generation of the global energy supply, has a negligible impact on the temperature of the planet."

In it, he goes over many different schemes of generating things.<p>My favorites are the ones he calls &quot;loopless&quot; since they do not have a loop during each iteration of the algorithm.  So, in this example, there is no need for the filter line that will ultimately have to loop (or hash or something else not trivial) to find the items to filter out).  In particular, to generate all permutations of binary digits requires something like 4 assignments and one test for each iteration.<p>The ridiculously interesting ones are based on De Bruijn sequences.  Basically, think if you have a combination lock that constantly shifts in 1 character when you type.  Is it possible to test all combinations of digits without &quot;wasting&quot; a keypress?"

Once the alternatives become cheaper, it&#x27;s better both economically and environmentally to distance away from Saudi oil.<p>Sure Saudi can make oil cheap as dirt to combat alternatives but then they aren&#x27;t making as much money. I don&#x27;t foresee a scenario that in 20 years Saudi oil demand will keep on rising.<p>Their entire economy is based on natural resources. Not a great place to be."

comment,14274380,,,1493999790,,tooker,"It used to irritate me having to use alternative grammar for accessing values in a mapping vs accessing object attributes.  However this is an area where I learned to appreciate Python&#x27;s hardline on consistency.  Guido in particular has been responsible for keeping the language predictable and concise by disallowing patterns like this in the language itself.  So on one hand it&#x27;s beautiful that it&#x27;s so easy to implement things like this (which I am guilty of doing too), but on the other it is a perversion of the intentional distinction between attributes and mappings.<p>I&#x27;ve since learned to love the distinction between object attributes and items in a mapping and happily implement [&#x27;this style&#x27;] accessors without complaint now.<p>That being said, if the library just did difflib.get_close_matches() on the key lookup that would be neat for some use cases where you want fuzzy keep lookup."

comment,14274320,,,1493999394,,acemarke,"Perf optimization is a big benefit, yes, but it also fits with functional programming principles in general.<p>React&#x27;s `setState()` definitely doesn&#x27;t care if you mutate or not - you can `.push()` right into an existing array in state, and re-set it into state to queue the re-render.<p>On the Redux side of things, immutability is important for several reasons.  First, pure reducer functions are more easily testable.  Second, they enable time-travel debugging - without immutability, jumping back and forth in state would cause the state contents to behave unpredictably, breaking time-travel.  Third, the React-Redux `connect` function relies on immutability checks against the root of the state tree to see if it _thinks_ anything has changed, and against the return values of your `mapState` functions as well.  If you mutate Redux state, your connected components usually won&#x27;t re-render properly, because they think nothing has changed."

comment,14274302,,,1493999287,,soapdog,"I think what they are saying is not that you can&#x27;t type without looking at the screen, is that you can&#x27;t use a touchscreen without glancing it at some time. For example: is the keyboard up? are you on the right app? did you by any chance dismissed the keyboard or is there a modal? You can&#x27;t infer this type of interaction without looking at the screen. Touching on glass gives you no feedback.<p>As an anecdote, I have a galaxy note 4 here as my daily driver. The battery has been replaced but still, it doesn&#x27;t last long. I want my phone to last at least until I get back home, so I decided to change some habits. When I commute to the university, I used spotify to listen to an offline playlist. I decided that listening to music with the smartphone could be replaced with a secondary device. I have a fondness for old minidisc format, so I found my old MD player (a sony mz-r700), recorded my playlists there and started using that while walking. That player has a remote full of buttons, real buttons to control basically all aspects of music playing, from navigation, to volume to anything. With my phone, I would often press play before leaving my building and not interact with it anymore. With the MD player and the remote, I can fiddle with all the controls without ever looking at the player in my pocket or the remote itself. In the end, I use my player features much more than I used the smartphone. I am not only a happier listener but it saves me phone battery.<p>In conclusion, tactic feedback that allows you to do stuff without requiring visual attention removes friction and encourages interaction. As an exercise to those that find this information disagreable, try typing a novel on a Yoga Book without looking at the screen, it is quite hard. Doing the same on a thinkpad is still hard but it is easier than the yoga book option."

comment,14274236,,,1493998893,,meri_dian,"&lt;From Section 1&gt;&quot;A straightforward way of capturing the No-Difference View is total utilitarianism according to which the best outcome is the one in which there would be the greatest quantity of whatever makes life worth living (Parfit 1984 p. 387). However, this view implies that any loss in the quality of lives in a population can be compensated for by a sufficient gain in the quantity of a population&quot;<p>Well yes, but while &#x27;total utility&#x27; may be a relevant measure for a population, populations in the aggregate do not have conscious experience. Therefore &#x27;total utility&#x27; is irrelevant for the individual. It&#x27;s a very poor measure of the &#x27;quality&#x27; of a society.<p>A much better (and more intuitively appealing) measure incorporates &#x27;total utility&#x27; but divides it by population to get average utility. If we take this as our guiding measure then we aren&#x27;t forced to reach The Repugnant Conclusion.<p>But on second thought, this also presents a problem. Because then we could posit a world in which most of the population lives in misery but a small percentage lives wonderful, fulfilling &#x27;maximum utility&#x27; lives. Average utility as I&#x27;ve described it would favor some of these these worlds - given a large enough population - over ones in which there&#x27;s a more even distribution of utility.<p>Therefore let&#x27;s take a page from economics and incorporate a GINI Coefficient measure of utility into our consideration of an ideal world. This should actually eliminate the threat of a Repugnant Conclusion."

comment,14274185,,,1493998441,,tptacek,"The subtlety is in how phishing attacks work. If you initiate a login yourself, unbidden by any outside request, the likelihood of you being phished in that scenario is epsilon. In that situation, the TOTP authenticator on your phone is fine. However, if you&#x27;re logging in as a middle step in a series of steps to get something done (say, answering a request you received via Slack or an email), the likelihood that you could be being phished grows. In those scenarios, the mutual authentication done by the security key helps protect you.<p>The security key is slightly easier to use than the TOTP authenticator and it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll tend to use most of the time. But if you happen to forget it at home or you&#x27;re logging in to check your mail and your security key is halfway across the house but you have your phone handy or something like that, the TOTP backup option is convenient. You also need some kind of backup in case you lose the security key."

Once done (pretty sure it&#x27;d be trivial?) you&#x27;d never have to look at your master reducer again.<p>It&#x27;d all live wherever you like, and be passed on to the master reducer via dispatch.

comment,14274143,,,1493998147,,logfromblammo,"I&#x27;m the only person allowed (by me) to be a hypocrite.<p>The legal doctrines collectively called <i>estoppel</i> ensure this in courts of equity.  You cannot first argue one thing and then later argue a contradictory position.  And in the court of public opinion, you cannot argue that no one has the right to data privacy and then later try to invoke some form of right to data privacy for yourself.<p>Most of the time, that doesn&#x27;t matter.  But when a member of a legislature codifies into law that <i>I</i> don&#x27;t have privacy, I for danged sure am not going to even grant that guy a sliver of a courtesy of a fig leaf of privacy.  I would air his dirty laundry immediately and without hesitation the instant any shred of it landed in my lap.<p>Because rights are a cooperative compact between equals.  They <i>are</i> given as a reward for good behavior, but it is the summation of good behavior across hundreds of millions of individuals.  It doesn&#x27;t matter so much what I <i>believe</i> in relation to a right, but what I <i>do</i>.  If I, for instance, did not believe that owning and carrying sidearms was a right, I probably would just not own or carry one, and the right would not be affected.  If I instead launched a crusade to destroy all pistols, my neighbors would likely be even more unhappy if I did it while carrying for my own protection.<p>You only have those rights you are willing to extend to others.  That is tit-for-tat social strategy writ large."

comment,14274107,,,1493997871,,tuna-piano,"I actually think the author has a good point.<p>When the owner of an iPhone wants a new phone, they overwhelmingly buy an iPhone.  The author makes the point, and I agree, that it is because of the iOS software and not the iPhone hardware.<p>iOS users already have made investments in iOS apps, talk to their friends using iMessage, and are used to the look and feel of the OS.  If these users could buy a Samsung phone with iOS on it, I suspect many would (say for phones with better battery life or other features).<p>So when in China a user spends the vast majority of their time in one app, that app kind of becomes the OS, and there are much lower switching costs between Android and iOS.  Customers in China are in large part just choosing which hardware to run WeChat on.<p>That said, the history in desktop OS tells a less clear story.<p>In 1998, Windows was what almost everyone needed to buy, because they needed to run Windows software.  Overtime the web browser (which works the same across operating systems) became where people spent most of their time, and ChromeOS and Mac were able to gain market share.<p>Apple laptops still have significant market share and pricing power.  But when you compare the Samsung S8 vs iPhone 7, I see much fewer differences than the MacBook vs HP&#x2F;Dell whatever."

comment,14274002,,,1493997162,,dsmithatx,"I&#x27;m a senior lead on a team that had massive turnover and now has all new people.  We support many large and complex web stacks.  As a result the guys on my team don&#x27;t always know how we do things.  Many will agree to commitments they can&#x27;t fill.<p>A 15 minute standup means our team leader and I do not have to wonder what they might be doing or creating.  They say what they are working on and we guide them.  Daily we catch issues where they overly complicating something, or scared to ask for help, or doing any number of crazy things.<p>We are very laid back and don&#x27;t have huge timelines.  If someone doesn&#x27;t show up or have much to say we don&#x27;t even talk about it.  We know they work hard when they do and standup is never about finding out if they are working or not.  In a large enterprise the team leader has meetings all day and can&#x27;t know what is going on when they have 10-15 people under them.  The standup solves that issue.<p>It works great for us and no one has any issues.  I&#x27;d much rather talk about what I work on for a few minutes each day than be micro-managed."

comment,14273963,,,1493996847,,jerf,"&quot;Experiments would take at least several months to run, because it&#x27;s not till several months that you know whether your business is going to fail solely due to the dev team.&quot;<p>If you use the rather stodgy and formulaic scientific method, sure. But if you approach this as a multi-arm bandit problem, and instead look at the question as &quot;how much information do I need to collect with how much statistical power before I am justified in selecting an outcome?&quot;, it becomes quite tractable for a team to just try it out.<p>It also helps if instead of using merely &quot;productivity&quot; as your one and only goal that you also consider team happiness as a real and going concern. Then &quot;Nobody likes it and it&#x27;s demoralizing the engineers&quot; becomes a perfectly valid form of feedback to use in the decision about whether to do it.<p>I also tend to use the metric that the brain is really, really, <i>really</i> good at figuring out what&#x27;s important, sometimes perhaps even too good, so if we start a stand-up meeting plan, and it just sort of peters out, then I let it go. (Seems like somebody wants to try it every 2 or 3 years or so, I generally just let it happen and then evaluate.) Everybody&#x27;s brains are coming to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not important. Rather than fighting it, roll with it. There are some things in life where your rational forebrain must override the deeper instinctive algorithms about what is important, but that&#x27;s quite cognitively expensive, and I&#x27;ve never seen any reason to believe that stand-up meetings are bringing enough value to justify that.<p>I emphasize the &quot;<i>I&#x27;ve</i> never seen any reason&quot;. I hypothesize that in many ways, the work the teams I&#x27;ve been on have been doing is almost maximally pathologically bad for a stand-up meeting. Almost everyone is working on something independent of everybody else, so blockers are only rarely even possible. If your team is, on the other hand, chock-a-block full of blocking potential it may be useful to <i>you</i>.<p>Anyways, there&#x27;s more ways to find out the truth of things that trying to split the universe into two precisely equal parts, make a change in only one of them, and come back ten years later to see what happened, only for someone to complain that a sample size of one isn&#x27;t enough and we really need to do this a thousand more times to have a valid result."

comment,14273894,,,1493996353,,MarkusWinand,"I&#x27;m curios if this is a fair benchmark (considering it was conducted by one of the vendors).<p>So I downloaded the mentioned whitepaper to look at the indexes they created in PostgreSQL.<p>The only thing mentioned in the whitepaper is this table definition:<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t1 (
  &quot;uuid&quot; VARCHAR,
  &quot;ts&quot; TIMESTAMP, &quot;tenant_id&quot; INT4, &quot;sensor_id&quot; VARCHAR,   
  &quot;sensor_type&quot; VARCHAR, &quot;v1&quot; INT4,
  &quot;v2&quot; INT4,
  &quot;v3&quot; FLOAT4,
  &quot;v4&quot; FLOAT4,
  &quot;v5&quot; BOOL,
  &quot;week_generated&quot; TIMESTAMP, &quot;taxonomy&quot; ltree
  );
</code></pre>
The table definition in Crate is a little different:<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS b.t2 ( &quot;uuid&quot; STRING,
  &quot;ts&quot; TIMESTAMP,
  &quot;tenant_id&quot; INTEGER, &quot;sensor_id&quot; STRING, &quot;sensor_type&quot; STRING,
  &quot;v1&quot; INTEGER,
  &quot;v2&quot; INTEGER,
  &quot;v3&quot; FLOAT,
  &quot;v4&quot; FLOAT,
  &quot;v5&quot; BOOLEAN,
  &quot;week_generated&quot; TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS     date_trunc(&#x27;week&#x27;, ts),
   INDEX &quot;taxonomy&quot; USING FULLTEXT (sensor_type) WITH (analyzer=&#x27;tree&#x27;)
  ) PARTITIONED BY (&quot;week_generated&quot;) 
  CLUSTERED BY (&quot;tenant_id&quot;) INTO 3 SHARDS;
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t know anything about how Crate works, but I see PARTITIONED BY (&quot;week_generated&quot;) and 
CLUSTERED BY (&quot;tenant_id&quot;) INTO 3 SHARDS.<p>Now looking at the first query, both, their PARTITION BY as well as CLUSTER BY columns appear in the query:<p><pre><code>  SELECT min(v1) as v1_min, max(v1) as v1_max, avg(v1) as v1_avg, sum(v1) as v1_sum
  FROM b.t2
  WHERE tenant_id = ? AND week_generated BETWEEN ? AND ?;
</code></pre>
Unless there is a sufficiently good index used in PostgreSQL, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a fair benchmark.<p>In the Appendix they mention how the partitioning could be implemented in PostgreSQL, also mention the indexes to be used together with the partitioning, but also say: &quot;Because of this, we abandoned the partitioning approach for our benchmark, instead opting for a single PostgreSQL table with no partition logic.&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t find any statement about if&#x2F;which indexes they were using in PostgreSQL when measuring their benchmarks.<p>They also use a rather old PostgreSQL version (9.2 — released in 2012). Now, we have PostgreSQL 9.6 which has some parallel query execution support that might also change this figures dramatically."

comment,14273858,,,1493996063,,aphextron,"&gt;Try this: close your eyes and tie your shoelaces. No problem at all, right? Now, how well do you think you could tie your shoes if your arm was asleep? Or even if your fingers were numb? When working with our hands, touch does the driving, and vision helps out from the back seat.<p>I think this is an awful analogy. I can type just as fast on my touchscreen no problem without looking. The problem with having physical keyboards on a phone is space. You&#x27;re taking up a solid 1&#x2F;4th of the weight and bulk of a phone with something that is entirely dedicated to the single purpose of entering text. On top of that keyboards are a vector for dust and moisture to enter, making the phone less durable. There&#x27;s a reason iPhone is the single greatest selling electronic device in history, and RIM is circling the drain. People want slim, sexy, lightweight touch phones. Not bricks with keyboards."

(For one, this would work because it <i>does</i> work, <i>right now</i> in Erlang.) But they all came down to that it seems like you&#x27;re missing some of the problems that containerization solves. You can wrap up almost any service -- regardless of language or versions or runtimes or how it interacts with the filesystem or what versions of libraries it depends on or what global configs it expects or anything -- and ship it as a self-contained normalized service that can run right alongside any other number of other self-contained normalized services that require <i>their own</i> global configs and libraries etc etc <i>even if they&#x27;re incompatible</i> and whoever is deploying them doesn&#x27;t even need to care.<p>Everyone has their own language and toolset that they&#x27;re comfortable with and productive in. That will never change. Containerization abstracts over all of them and normalizes their deployment. You can never get that with a solution at the language level."

Unlike the unix world, they can interact with the terminal without sending things to the host, and there&#x27;s support for something sort of like html forms, tab traversal, etc.  They fill out fields and press a send key.  You can&#x27;t, for example, use a normal telnet client.

comment,14273489,,,1493993067,,grandalf,"&gt; &quot;jumping on the bandwagon&quot; is kind of a conversation ender<p>Has there not been a very profound anti-Uber bandwagon effect going on?  Several incidents snowballing into a major backlash?  I think there is some sort of organized labor sponsorship of a smear campaign, fwiw.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think there are overall benefits<p>I&#x27;m curious how you reach this conclusion.  Is it as a consumer, comparing Uber to traditional taxi offerings in your area? Or based on some other viewpoint?<p>&gt;  I am not convinced Uber is some huge innovation<p>I think innovation is the wrong word as well.  Uber is a political and economic achievement of breaking a very entrenched system that had oppressed many people so that a small number could extract profits at the expense of society as as a whole.<p>&gt; democracy and the rule of law are ... important<p>Absolutely. I view corrupt laws and crony capitalism as antithetical to the rule of law even if the laws which happen to be on the books support specific arrangements.  The taxi market was a golden goose being plucked by corrupt officials and a small number of fat cat owners at the expense of <i>everyone</i> else.<p>These sorts of crony&#x2F;entrenched arrangements are a form of organized crime, as are the regulators who enforce unfair laws meant to funnel money into the coffers of specific crony firms.<p>&gt; my version of this being fun is being understood.<p>I <i>think</i> I understand your points. But I&#x27;m not sure how you weigh your various points against each other in terms of their influence on your overall view.  I don&#x27;t disagree with any of them outright, but I think you weigh literal compliance with law too highly.<p>Also, on the subject of Uber&#x27;s corporate culture, Uber has been punished significantly already for the revelations about its culture. As much as I admire Uber&#x27;s accomplishments, I would very likely not want to work there.<p>One time I got a coding quiz easter egg in the Uber app and scored well and was invited to apply, but after what I&#x27;ve heard I would be unlikely to consider it, since I personally view the tolerance of sexual harassment behavior by companies to be one of the biggest indicators of larger culture problems and a &quot;law of the jungle&quot; environment where social dominance trumps merit when it comes to how decisions are made."

comment,14273453,,,1493992805,,georgespencer,"&gt; 30% is a pretty hefty percentage. It&#x27;s the weakest point in the article but imagine if I just cut your salary by 30%, is your job still worthwhile?<p>I&#x27;m unclear how this is a response to my response to OP. OP is saying that Apple forces developers to target the biggest possible audience by taking 30%. I&#x27;m arguing that Apple is agnostic and that if there&#x27;s a way for developers to make more money in a niche then Apple is happy with that. And you can always price your software at +30%.<p>&gt; Except it&#x27;s not the same functionality. Try Evernote for instance ... does it LOOK like the same functionality? That&#x27;s a lot of developer effort you can&#x27;t recoup. You&#x27;ve just diminished all that extra work to support both modalities with a wave of your hand.<p>That&#x27;s a distinction which isn&#x27;t made in the article. Autolayout makes it trivial to support the same functionality across both devices. If you want to introduce new functionality with the iPad then have a separate app. I believe you&#x27;re still entitled to do precisely that.<p>&gt; That thing you paid for 5 years ago no longer exists, the software you bought 5 years ago can&#x27;t even RUN on your new iPhone, what you are getting, for free, is the thing the developer made this year, with actual work, which looks like the thing you bought 5 years ago.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this I&#x27;m afraid. If you&#x27;re discussing the fact that apps sometimes need to be updated to keep running on the new versions of iOS then that&#x27;s just part of the cost of business, but plenty of developers choose to not do this. Again, nobody is forcing developers to do this. Nobody is not buying your app because they think it might not be supported in five years time.<p>&gt; But they do encourage it. It&#x27;s part of the diminishing effect. That you can opt out as a developer doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>It&#x27;s only a diminishing effect on consumers if Apple encourages developers to do it and they do it. There&#x27;s nothing forcing developers to do it. They&#x27;re choosing to. They only have themselves to blame."

It&#x27;s pretty clear that, given the referendum, even Labour would have a hard time voting against Brexit.<p>The weakness is that Brexit is simply 5x worse for the UK than it is for the EU, at least economically. The UK does around 50% of its foreign trade with the EU, while for the EU, which is much larger, this represents only around 10% of trade.<p>The result of failed negotiations is, for the UK, widespread economic depression. For EU countries, it&#x27;s a slight economic road bump. It&#x27;s the same mechanism that makes it a much bigger deal for you to get hired by Google than it does for Google.<p>There&#x27;s no amount of nationalism, tough talk, bluffing, or posturing Britain can do to change the fact that, at the end of the day, Europe can walk away from these negotiations at any time. Indeed, given the wish to clearly show, once and for all, the benefits of EU membership, failure may already be close to break-even. And even bureaucratic monsters have feelings–the Daily Mail may end up creating true European unity as a parting gift.<p>All this was obviously known before the referendum, which is why it&#x27;s baffling to still not even see it being addressed in conservative circles, which instead continue to be rewarded for lying and riling up a nationalistic furore.<p>&gt; The thing is we have a bigger problem<p>Indeed"

comment,14273381,,,1493992101,,matwood,"&gt; When you break things down, you make it easier for less experienced workers to complete work.<p>Actually you make it easier for everyone. The point of breaking down a task is to start removing assumptions, and make it so others can also lend a hand.<p>&gt; However, increased breakdown is very costly on many levels. You need extra time to break things down (senior dev), extra effort to track it in project management tools, extra time to deal with it all every day. It&#x27;s costly.<p>Time and again I have heard this reasoning, but in my experience the real costs comes when <i>not</i> breaking down tasks. There is an unknown unknown problem with large tasks, that is often solved by breaking them down with the stake holder instead of finding the issues during acceptance.<p>I do agree though that the right level to break down tasks is an art that ends up being team specific."

If he doesn&#x27;t know who it is, he asks the manager and he will direct him to the right person. If there is literally no way to proceed, he will work on another issue in the meantime and inform the manager that he&#x27;s blocked on the more important stuff. If there is some way to speed it along together with multiple other people, it will come up when he talks to that first guy. Obviously waiting for the next standup tomorrow is a ridiculous proposition, so standups solve a problem for 1 time of the day requiring by definition more people than should be required because everyone is in it instead of pulling the people in that need to be pulled in for that specific block or feature.<p>I don&#x27;t even know how people defend standups, they usually say something like &quot;hey yeah, I know it&#x27;s mostly useless but it&#x27;s just for 10min a day&quot;.

I&#x27;ve found that what&#x27;s been most effective for me, aside from spending (admittedly, far too much) time coding in the evenings before sleep, is making a concerted effort to share whole-day responsibility of the kids on weekends. I&#x27;ll take the kids on one day, my wife will take the kids on another day. We trade off during the week too so we can both have large stretches of uninterrupted time.<p>Exercise (and for me, meditation) are important balancers too - don&#x27;t neglect them for the sake of coding, you&#x27;ll find that you just get burnt out."
comment,14273213,,,1493990550,,soVeryTired,"It&#x27;s quite possible that you can teach yourself a lot of the relevant background. If you read David Barber&#x27;s book cover to cover and do all the problems, that&#x27;s a machine learning masters&#x27; course covered.<p>But the problem is that you&#x27;re competing against job applicants who already have a degree in machine learning. So it will often be the case that you&#x27;re lucky to make it past an initial HR screen. If they want to interview ten people, life is easier for them to pick ten who already have the right piece of paper."

comment,14273135,,,1493989875,,microtherion,"I transferred into my current job a few years ago, and this year, I interviewed two transfer candidates, one of them (not you, I&#x27;m pretty sure) a QA engineer who wanted to move into an engineering role, so I might have some thoughts on this situation from the other side:<p>What advantages does the candidate expect from being an internal transfer, and what can we fairly offer them? To me, an internal transfer has a sizable advantage in that they are a known quantity in many aspects: You can ask them in much more detail about previous work at the company, you can talk to their co-workers, you have a clearer sense of the projects you were involved in, and in some cases you may already have personally worked with them.<p>Where we DON&#x27;T cut the candidates any slack is the technical side of the job, and QA is usually different work from engineering. So the candidates still stand or fall based on the technical interview.<p>The controversial aspect of Machine Learning jobs in particular, and the situation you described, is credentialism. In many areas of software engineering, credentials are indeed overrated, but Machine Learning IS a very technical field, requiring rather advanced math to truly understand it (rather than just blindly plug together pieces from an ML toolkit), and right now the field is undergoing revolutionary changes, so this is one area where a recent graduate degree really DOES convey a concrete advantage.<p>It should not be an INSURMOUNTABLE advantage, but you&#x27;d have to be a very impressive non-academic candidate. What ML papers have you recently read? How would you plan to apply them in the job you&#x27;re aspiring to? What contributions have you made to the field?"

comment,14272949,,,1493988032,,cwyers,"&gt; P.S. It&#x27;s called ’statistics’.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Read Breiman&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.&quot;<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.math.uu.se&#x2F;~thulin&#x2F;mm&#x2F;breiman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.math.uu.se&#x2F;~thulin&#x2F;mm&#x2F;breiman.pdf</a><p>&quot;Statistics&quot; has largely been concerned with the &quot;data modelling culture&quot; Breiman talks about; a lot of data science is focused on algorithmic modelling, things like neural nets, random forests, and so on. A lot of these techniques have been refined outside of modern statistics because of statistic&#x27;s focus on data modelling.<p>This also ignores all of the things that fall outside of the purview of the modelling steps altogether, things like data cleaning, data engineering, and so on. All of those are properly &quot;data science&quot; but often fall outside of what&#x27;s in a statistics textbook.<p>If you are going to do data science, you should know statistics. You should know a lot of it. But that is far from the only thing you should know.<p>As to your larger point... yeah, well, jobs allow people to eat and get health insurance and all that, so it&#x27;s understandable that OP might want to be able to do those things and not just apply it for his own pleasure. My take on that is that it&#x27;s hard, both to acquire the skills needed and to signal to employers that you have them. If you&#x27;re going that route, you need to build a solid portfolio of work. Kaggle might be a good place to start."

That they recognized the bank as a police credit union instead of recognizing the Star of David as a Jewish symbol doesn&#x27;t meaningfully change the scenario.<p>PCI is not concerned about protecting the user.

There will not be any significant public opposition to this, a few articles in The Guardian and a small mention on the news between Trump stories. I have only experienced apathy when I discuss mass surveillance with people in this country. &quot;I have nothing to hide, why should I care?&quot;. There is a fundamental disconnect between real world privacy and online privacy to most people in this country. At this point it is too late anyway, May has gone full frontal assault on the internet and privacy advocates and security experts don&#x27;t have a hope. I just want her to go full-on now and implement maximum surveillance, maximum snooping and maximum data retention and profiling. All of this can only blow up embarrassingly in her face.

comment,14272700,,,1493985271,,gjm11,"I think there&#x27;s a place for the &quot;# retrieve data&quot; sort of comment. Suppose you&#x27;re <i>skimming</i> rather than reading the code, either trying to get a high-level overview of what it does or looking for the particular bit of it where a particular thing happens. Then, sure, you could just read all the code; but most of us can skim-read a small quantity of text faster than a larger quantity of code. In a syntax-colouring editor it&#x27;s easy to ignore everything but the comments, and if the top-level structure of what&#x27;s happening is sketched in the comments that&#x27;s helpful.<p>How helpful depends, of course, on the style of the code; in particular, it gets less helpful as the length of functions&#x2F;methods goes down, and in the limit of &quot;ravioli code&quot; where everything is decomposed into 3-line methods whose main task is calling other 3-line methods, it doesn&#x27;t help at all and the sort of comment you need to help with skimming is an overview of how the pieces fit together. At the other extreme, if you have the sort of 1000-line function that&#x27;s quite common in e.g. numerical code, these structure-sketching comments can be invaluable."

That is enough to give a manager a <i>pause</i>, but not to immediately dismiss it as a bad idea.<p>Most professionals will agree that it&#x27;s unrealistic to believe that developer-typing-code-time has 100% efficiency. The time spent &#x27;decompressing&#x27;, which can <i>sometimes</i> manifest itself as spending time reading&#x2F;doing unrelated stuff, does sometimes produce a solution faster than just banging away coding.<p>Management work is different from coding in that everything is hard and noisy to measure, so to some extent heuristics are relied upon, simply because it&#x27;s the state of the art in this area.<p>So, even if half an hour meeting with 8 developers takes 4 developer-hours (which is a rather large number), it does not mean those hours are wasted. If one of those meetings a day stops someone spending one week chasing a dead-end known to others at least once in a while, on average the team moves faster, not slower.<p>BTW, I actually agree that 8 developers is too much, and that half an hour is too long for a daily.

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the main point of the article though, it&#x27;s just trying to show how an inventor of something is not necessarily the person benefiting financially from their invention."
comment,14272508,,,1493982051,,jeltz,"As a Swede I find using us as an example hilarious. We are not a country which has traditionally cared too much about money laundering, most of our anti-money laundering stuff comes from other EU countries via the EU. And we definitely definitely do not have any problems with the tax revenue, our socialist government might even lower corporate taxes next year due to the current stable government income.<p>As for eliminating cash, yes we try to do that, but the reason given is not money laundering. The two reason&#x2F;excuses which are commonly given are 1) preventing tax evasion and 2) preventing store robberies. Also note that the ones most heavily pushing for elimination of cash is not our government but our banks. I think card payments are much more profitable for banks compared to cash. But it is not like our government makes a secret about that its regulations surrounding cash payments are there to prevent tax fraud.<p>And the worst country for when it comes to hunting taxes is probably the US. A couple of days ago I had to sign two forms when opening a bank account where I guaranteed that I had no ties to America. Many smaller European banks wont even accept American citizens as customers due to the extra paper work to report stuff to the American IRS."
comment,14272505,,,1493982012,,audunw,"I think this illustrates one of the catch-22&#x27;s of patents. If you hold the patent, other companies does not have incentive to make and market the invention, making it harder to create market awareness. But if you let go of the patent, unless you have the resources to compete, you&#x27;re unlikely to benefit from your invention. You do have an early mover advantage, but if you don&#x27;t have the means to invest, it doesn&#x27;t help.<p>I think the interface between IP markets and the goods&#x2F;services markets is deeply broken.<p>The core of the problem is that we have to create artificial scarcity to balance the IP economy against the &quot;real&quot; economy. For example: in theory, you could have access to every movie ever created for free. It doesn&#x27;t cost anything to make a copy. This is unlike things like bread or haircuts, where having an infinite supply is a physical impossibility. But the people making the movies have to pay for bread and haircuts, so you have to pay them something. And to get you to pay for it, you have to balance your desire to watch movies against your need to buy bread and haircuts.<p>Previously we achieved this only through artificial scarcity. Now, with Spotify, you have another model which is: someone decides that everyone should pay $50-$99 a month for music, and then you have access to all the music. The problem is that this is a pretty inelastic market. It&#x27;s hard to create competing services with different prices. It&#x27;s also undemocratic. And the default is still artificial scarcity.<p>You could imagine an IP tax. Through a democratic process, we decide that X% of our incomes should be spent on developing IP. All IP is free, but you have IP credits that you spend on the IPs that have value for you, in whatever ratio you want. The number of credits the inventor&#x2F;designer&#x2F;creator receives in a month is then used to fairly divide the fund generated from the IP tax. IP developers also have to pay IP tax, and receive IP credits, so it would be natural for them to forward credits to the IP they depend upon. Since you can&#x27;t spend the IP credits on yourself, you have no incentive to not support the IPs that you benefited from.<p>This solutions is just a thought experiment. It might not be feasible, and it&#x27;s a government-based solution. I&#x27;m not ideologically opposed to government solutions, but it is inelegant. The point is just to think about how we could interface the IP markets with the &quot;real&quot; markets in a more efficient way. There must be better solutions than what we have today.<p>Another option may be to introduce basic income, have everything be free, and just rely on donations, crowdfunding and merchandise for extra funding. Patreon seems to show that people are actually willing to simply give money to the things they like, as long as they get credit."

If your task is implementing analytics and no one else on the team has anything much to do with it, then maybe it&#x27;s best not to trouble them with the specifics.  Your summary is much better, and only a few extra words, but if no one really cares about the analytics except to know that it&#x27;s cheerfully in progress, maybe it&#x27;s not all that necessary to go into more detail. This is definitely something you need to be wary of in a multi-disciplinary team.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t mean &quot;Anyone can come over and ask me about analytics if they like!&quot; to sound defensive - it was actually more tongue-in-cheek!  Here&#x27;s another attempt: &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine why you would want to bore yourself with my analytics implementation, but please come over and ask me about it if you&#x27;re having trouble sleeping at night.&quot;  (I will freely admit that I am a confident person and would have no trouble saying something like that in front of a dozen people.)"

comment,14272064,,,1493974947,,jonathanstrange,"Even this is probably not very meaningful.<p>Seasoned and experienced Ada programmers are likely to come from a high-level (software) engineering background in some large company, e.g. in the aviation industry or military. Haskell programmers will more likely work in academia, e.g. a professor of computer science. And the C++ programmers could come from any field or industry.<p>These people will likely shine with certain tasks and be less productive with other tasks, depending on their varying skill sets. So you&#x27;re probably only measuring the overall level of proficiency of programmers of certain languages in a particular programming domain. For example, I&#x27;d bet that the average experienced C++ programmer is slightly less skilled than the average experienced Ada programmer (if both of them are mostly working with their language professionally), simply because C++ is more widespread whereas the few Ada jobs left require a relatively high level of expertise. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re writing programs in Ada for Airbus,  you&#x27;re probably accustomed to a slower development pace than if you write C++ code for a small gaming company, so the &quot;productivity&quot; will appear to be fairly low in comparison.<p>Then there are measures like LOC that are fairly meaningless across languages and perhaps even in general.<p>Finally, languages are usually chosen for their tool and library support and on the basis of available developers anyway."

When the whole learning experience is made easy and playful enough, one can start teaching fast and build more complicated assignments on top of that knowledge later on. My experience is based on building a 3D modeling platform to get children interested in design (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3dc.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3dc.io</a>). What we found is that once you get the kids modeling and collaborating with each other in a fun and engaging way, it&#x27;s possible to successfully teach them problem solving in wider contexts (even design thinking) already in the primary school.

If we assume that finding a new fleet owner is easy, then jumping ship and finding employment with someone else may make the driver&#x27;s need to maintain a good rating a fuzzy matter.<p>If anyone wishes to learn more, here&#x27;s an article to throw into Google Translate:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.folha.uol.com.br&#x2F;cotidiano&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;1746900-motoristas-alugam-carros-e-montam-frota-de-uber-em-sp.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.folha.uol.com.br&#x2F;cotidiano&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;1746900-motor...</a>"

Porting free software to a walled garden is grotesque.<p>I think focus and efforts should be directed at making good software for Linux. And I do not think that porting OSS and free software to closed systems is a good strategy for converting users.<p>Users switch from macOS and Windows to Linux for all kinds of reasons, but there is no point in trying to &quot;lure&quot; them in any way.

story,14271878,Ask HN: How much does every extra percent of equity require you to work?,1,1493972022,,_a1,"I&#x27;ve recently got an offer for engineering work at a company for a market rate salary and 2% ownership share on a 4 year vesting schedule, and have been working with them and happy for over a year. I am used to working 80 hour weeks, I work on weekends and in my downtime and frankly enjoy what I do in the hours of work that I put.<p>Obviously, some employees will have bigger ownership shares for understandable reasons that they have been in the company since the start, other employees and advisors have the same ownership share I do, but with the quality of work and the effort they put in they seem like they work much less hours.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in picking a fight here, but I&#x27;m curious to know how ownership share should actually affect how much work you put it, the latter being somewhat directly related to the number of hours and number of overnights you end up doing to get that work done.<p>If you&#x27;re at market rate, you would be at 45 hour work weeks. At 2% equity, you give your work some extra time and maybe think about designs and solutions in your downtime and at home during weird hours. But say that ownership share was at 5%, or you&#x27;re down to no salary and 2% ownership, does that make a difference in the overtime you&#x27;re supposed to put in?"

If both sides have a hard line behaviour, it will never change.<p>Instead, I recommend showing the advantages of flexibility.  &quot;I worked overtime to give you this thing which would not have been possible under your rules, how about cutting me some slack as a reward?&quot;  Somebody has to budge first.  Now, if they are only interested in sucking up as much of your time as possible and paying you as little as possible -- then they are being abusive.

comment,14271677,,,1493968625,,MrBra,"Slack is a kind of a white fly or an exception if you see the bigger picture because it&#x27;s in a segment that targets the devs community, which is very attentive and careful about the product they choose, because have the skills to decide about it.<p>But what would happen with a product targeting a more generic public (non only tech savvy people), like a new sharing economy app or a new innovative social network?<p>What I am trying to say is... the big players are now so big that they are just going to integrate any IT idea that is cool and profitable, in no time.<p>This is what saddens me. We are not in early 2000 anymore, got a concept around manipulating pictures? Yay, make a website and give it a beta badge icon and there you go, you got popular and people are interested in investing in you!<p>Nowadays? Go develop your new picture filters, meanwhile google engineers will publish a blog post where they talk about how their machine learning libs powered by 11230021 GPUs has got better result in that aspect and they will now integrate that capability in all Google pic manipulating products.<p>Do you get what I am saying?"

comment,14271635,,,1493967919,,actualproblem,"&gt; What about days without school? It sounds like the poor kids just go hungry. Summer vacation means no food.<p>Yeah, this is actually a problem. Which is why the Summer Food Service Program exists. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Summer_Food_Service_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Summer_Food_Service_Program</a><p>Unfortunately, kids living in places with a local government unwilling to jump to offer this program (which is reimbursed by the federal government) don&#x27;t have the opportunity. There are a lot of places in America where local government is incompetent and&#x2F;or sadistic. (See also: Medicaid expansion.)<p>&gt; What about the kids from families with higher standards? They are being forced to go hungry, eat garbage served by the school, or eat a lunch that is neither refrigerated nor heated.<p>Oh noes! Unrefrigerated, unheated lunches! How can a human possibly survive?! Tip: if you need your lunch at a thermal gradient to the ambient, try an icepack and insulated bag and&#x2F;or a thermos.<p>&gt; School lunch is a terrible way to feed the poor. If we&#x27;re going to do that, provide old-style food stamps or just have the postal service drop off food. Do it for everybody who doesn&#x27;t opt out.<p>There are lots of problems with school lunches. Even as a grade school kid in the 80&#x27;s, I knew there was something deeply wrong with being served lunch from a steam tray in front of a kitchen that never appeared to be actually used - my school building dated from a time when lunch was actually prepared on site from scratch, but by the time i was in school almost everything was coming from a box out of the deep freeze.<p>However, interrupt the current program without replacement nutrition in place and you&#x27;re going to disrupt the lives and educations of millions. Hungry kids don&#x27;t learn well (or behave in a way conducive to others around them learning.)<p>PS - I now live in Holland and my kids&#x27; school serves no lunch. They have to bring their own - unrefrigerated, un-heated. They manage. ( look wistfully at the school lunches served in France, and think the system here says a lot about Dutch food culture or lack thereof.) But poverty here is nothing like what I left behind in the US."

comment,14271617,,,1493967702,,glubGlub,"Given the general chaos of any single school, and the amount of &quot;<i>normal</i>&quot; discipline applied across all students in aggregate, it&#x27;s probably incredibly difficult for bystanders to notice and distinguish types of discipline, and the underlying motives behind disciplinary actions throughout the day.<p>Schools are noisy places. It&#x27;s partly a signal-to-noise and triage problem.<p>Kids fighting wjth each other. Kids disrupting class. Long quiet noiseless periods during tests. Fixed attention while movies are shown in class. Noisy cafeterias, amid rushed, scheduled lunches. Gym class as a more general hell. During the pace of everything else, it probably just blows by, while other more chaotic events grab attention.<p>To the individual child, it&#x27;s all-consuming. To the reader, each experience collected with similar accounts reads as deliberate child starvation. To bystanders in the moment, there&#x27;s probably a moment of temporary confusion, and then it&#x27;s ignored.<p>Kids should pretty much eat for free, especially at public schools, but in general too. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that healthy food remains expensive, and that kids will try to eat junk food as much as possible, but the last thing anyone wants to hear is kids being deprived of food for petty reasons.<p>It probably rings in the mind as less urgent in the moment, when there are no apparent signs of malnutrition visibly evident. Not as much the Dickensian orphanage of the imagination. In the moment, the situation probably strikes a person as the usual scolding ever-present throughout any school."

comment,14271509,,,1493965764,,djaychela,"This, indeed.  I&#x27;m currently teaching in schools in the UK, and nearly all the IT departments I deal with are solely interested in IT for its own end.  I&#x27;ve heard IT managers (at different schools) refer to it as &quot;[my] network&quot; or &quot;[my] machines&quot; - totally missing the point that they&#x27;re all there for one reason, to facilitate learning.  While this certainly isn&#x27;t the case in all schools, the majority of the ones I&#x27;ve worked at have IT departments who really have no interest in or knowledge of what teachers really need&#x2F;want to do, and simply put their own pre-decided processes and systems in place.<p>When trying to get something changed, a brick wall of technobabble is presented to school management who generally don&#x27;t know any better and defer to this &#x27;higher power&#x27;.  Unfortunately I know enough to have seen through many such reasons (such as &quot;You can&#x27;t have more than 10 Apple devices on a Wi-Fi network, it will crawl to a halt&quot;, and &quot;Firefox?  I&#x27;m not having that rubbish on my network - we&#x27;re sticking with Internet Explorer&quot;), but there&#x27;s no way to convince anyone in management that they&#x27;re being sold a dummy, particularly when it was they who decided to hire the IT manager in the first place.  I&#x27;ve got a room of machines where it takes 5 minutes to run the software I use to teach (Cubase) because the machines have mandatory profiles enforced that have been taken before the plug-in scanning has been done, so it does this scan (5 minutes or so) every time you run it.  Think of the learning time lost over the 5 years that&#x27;s been in place.<p>I really think a plan of getting these people out of their offices and into the workplace to shadow people who use what they maintain would make a world of difference.  Instead of being some whiner who creates &#x27;frivolous&#x27; support requests, they would see that a bad decision can drastically impact the experience of everyone who uses their tools.  I think I say this as someone who has been on the other side of the fence; I do support for some IT installations (including a first school with 400 pupils), so I&#x27;m tech savvy enough to be able to do what&#x27;s needed, but try to approach it from a function-first rather than ideological approach."

story,14271461,"Be courageous, share what you know",5,1493964820,,cypher303,"Sometimes people can get cagey in tech. We all have our domains, and I think it&#x27;s natural to feel threatened or encroached upon when someone else begins to pick up on that domain. But if you close up, and don’t share your knowledge with those on your team, then you’re not acting like a team member. Don’t get me wrong, I know that there is so much value to be had in properly failing. We fail, and then maybe we fail again, but then we fire up our engines and we blow the f’ing doors off. At least in my experience, failing was the best thing that ever happened to me. But personally, I&#x27;d like to see my teammates fail further ahead than I did.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that you hand your team members a blackbox and tell them to hop on your shoulders (unless that’s appropriate, then by all means), but warn them about common pitfalls and guide them when they struggle. Try to make it easy for them to succeed for as long as you can. For crying out loud, communicate! You might be wondering, “Who has time for this? Don’t you have a job to be doing?” Yeah, I do, but I’ve also got great teammates who can do that job now too.<p>It takes courage to share your hard earned knowledge with those who may someday replace you. And it’s so easy to hide behind the mystique that our field is known for. But I say be courageous, share what you know."

You can&#x27;t reliably tell if a piece of code is using a given package until you run it.<p>The dependency resolution sucks. It&#x27;s better now that they finally made it so nested dependencies aren&#x27;t duplicated, but why the hell do I have to run a manual dedupe command to do so? What that tells me is that npm doesn&#x27;t actually track dependencies, its hardly more than a fancy file downloading tool.<p>The repository curation sucks. I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ve used Python&#x27;s package manager, or Java&#x27;s, or C#&#x27;s, or Perls, but npm has zero package curation and is filled to the brim with garbage compared to the others. I have published packages for C# and Java and the semantics are well defined and reasonable, you even cryptographcally sign your code and the system checks to make sure you upload documentation etc... In the case of java, which has the best system I&#x27;ve seen, they even use something similar to DNS validation to make sure you control package namespace.<p>The above point is the absolute worst thing about npm and drawfs the other problems. Let me give an example by pasting the package publishing guidelines for Maven(Java) vs npm:<p>Publishing an npm package:
&gt;Use npm publish to publish the package.
&gt;Note that everything in the directory will be included unless it is ignored by a local .gitignore or .npmignore file as described in npm-developers.
&gt;Also <i>make sure there isn&#x27;t already a package with the same name, owned by somebody else.</i>
&gt;Test: Go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;&lt;package&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;&lt;package&gt;</a>. You should see the information for your new package.<p>I had to condense the Java guidelines but it&#x27;s roughly this:
create JIRA account
apply for access
review requirements
    verify namespace ownership
    generate crypto keys
    package coordinates&#x2F;versioning
       project description URL and license info
       developer info
       SCM info
package deployment
    generate binaries
    revolve package dependencies
    crypto sign package
    generate documentation
    online verification<p>Sounds like a lot of work right? It takes a few hours to setup and verify your domain&#x2F;keys the first time but after that all of these steps are automated. The signing&#x2F;building&#x2F;doc generation&#x2F; deployment is totally automated. Npm is a toy in comparison.<p>from their docs: 
Why Do We Have Requirements?
In order to ensure a minimum level of quality of the components available in the Central Repository, we have established a number of requirements your deployment components have to meet. This allows your users to find all the relevant details about the components from the metadata provided in the Central Repository. The following sections will detail these requirements.<p>Left-pad is a perfect example of why npm sucks. Nuget, Maven, Phython, and CPAN would have never let something that stupid happen."

comment,14271383,,,1493963425,,techsupporter,"&gt; Banks get paid far less interchange rates for Chip &amp; PIN than they do signature.<p>This only applies if the PIN is being used for debit.  I have two credit cards[0] that are issued by US-based financial institutions and, when the chip reader is equipped to do so, result in a prompt for a PIN when used.  The interchange rate is as a normal credit card.<p>The bigger issue, as has been explained to me by two people I know who work in payment tech, is that credit card issuers in the States are utterly panicked by the idea of doing anything that might result in even a small fraction of a percent of their cardholders switching to another card.  PINs are seen as inducing friction or a previously-unknown step into the payment process (since US customers have been conditioned for 20 years to &quot;enter a PIN for debit&quot; and &quot;sign for credit&quot;).  To now change to PIN-primary cards would result in confused customers, higher support costs, and plenty of customers switching either to another credit card or to (the horrors) another payment method entirely, like cash.  So the theory goes, anyway.  Therefore, US banks are loathe to introduce cards that can be verified by PIN <i>at all</i>, much less ones that are primarily verified by PIN.<p>0 - They are not debit cards with VISA or MasterCard logos; they are actual credit cards accessing a line of credit.  One comes from the State Department Federal Credit Union and the other from First Tech Federal Credit Union."

This would require lots of new technology and materials.

And without the extra mass you would have have much higher payload.

The insurer can charge an additional premium to the member as well, and generally these plans come in tiers which make tradeoffs like premium versus deductible.<p>Second, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that this is also the case in countries with fully nationalized single-payer systems: supplementary&#x2F;third-party plans tend to still be available in such countries. For example, in Canada private supplemental insurance is a multi-billion-dollar industry."
comment,14271278,,,1493961595,,spangry,"I don&#x27;t know how google 2FA is implemented, but I&#x27;d just assumed the initial code is akin to something like an initialisation vector &#x2F; nonce for a counter or CBC mode block cipher. With the counter being &#x27;time&#x27;, meaning the scheme works something like:<p>hash_fn(concat(IV, time)) -&gt; func(somehash) -&gt; [code seq. 1]<p>Then on the next round the IV is discarded and it becomes:<p>hash_fn(concat([code seq. 1], time)) -&gt; func(somehash) -&gt; [code seq. 2]<p>That&#x27;s almost certainly an over-simplification &#x2F; wrong; it doesn&#x27;t seem very secure to just use the previous output as the IV for the next round.

comment,14271173,,,1493959796,,kang,"Ethereum&#x27;s ecosystem cannot optimize for running dapps because the true value of its token is dynamically determined byt he blockchain network, for whatever value the minimum of its token provides. For eg, a gas is worth whatever the world wants to pay for it to use it as a unit of calculation on the world computer. To accurately measure the effort spent by the network to ensure the unit value of its token , we need a DMMS algorithm(as described in the sidechains paper) &amp; which is nothing but a proof-of-work blockchain.<p>Each primitive operation needs its own blockchain for its value to be determined accurately. When multiple token are implemented over a single blockchain, for eg colored&#x2F;custom coins, it cannot accurately measure the value of a unit.<p>In case of functional language, one could perhaps imagine a lisp blockchain with paul graham&#x27;s 7 primitives implemented as an opcode (stack based interpretor is irrelevant), which would be turing complete but will suffer from the problem of determining the true value of each opcode; the cheapest one will always be abused as evident on ethereum (suicide function&#x27;s cheapness was spammed)."

We typically don&#x27;t charge that for service and we do usually give a discount if someone wants to replace a product. I would totally be happy to look into this more. Can you email hr@fisherpaykel.com and let us know a few more details about what occurred?

Photography and film are completely different mediums, as are film and VR, which is the point. Nobody ever tried to replace or transform photography into film, because that would be ridiculous; trying to make traditional linear movies in VR would be equally ridiculous."

comment,14271020,,,1493956756,,NotSammyHagar,"I think every line of code is not intentional. People copy code, they make mistakes, there is emergent behavior. If you perhaps worked on a large system, like I have, databases, the database optimizers do things that you didn&#x27;t necessarily intend. the plan choices often get pushed in certain directions that were not necessarily what you meant. I worked on a query optimizer, and I tried to model the cost of different kinds of scans and filters, say on ints, vs strings, vs floats. It turned out strings were getting picked a lot of the time, and my choices (my modeling, really), led us to priotize using string based indexes more. Certain bugs and limitations in cardinality estimation lead to accidental but fortuitiously good query plan choices that were sometimes lost (not chosen) when we fixed certain bugs, exposing other bugs.<p>I definitely believe things happen in large programs that no one really intended."

It is very limiting.&quot;<p>To an extent, I&#x27;d agree as I myself miss the ability to use different lenses, set the framing, etc as storytelling devices. However, it is a matter of knowing the limitations of the medium, and not forcing &quot;traditional&quot; film making techniques into the new medium. Only frustration will result.<p>However, this format is new and evolving. Part of the idea is to give the viewer control over everything. Forcing a traditional linear story line is going against the grain of VR. More and more projects are coming out with a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; concept. Now that the tech is getting better, the tools content producers have to use will allow for more interactive content to be made. If the tech survives long enough to get there."

comment,14270984,,,1493956075,,hibikir,"In mine, it&#x27;s been just the opposite: I&#x27;ve been working professionally for 16 years, and extended contact with non developers always helped. It didn&#x27;t help me code faster, but it helped me code the right things, which is far more important than speed.<p>In my first job, We had separate infrastructure and development. Infrastructure had DBAs, Sys admins and specialists in random tooling, but nobody could code to save their lives. I managed to get myself sitting with infra, and not only I learned things that back then they&#x27;d not share with application programmers, but I could use my programming skills to deal with a lot of low hanging fruit. Today nobody in their right mind would train someone to know SQL and DB administration and know no general programming at all, because of how much power you lose by not coding... but there, it was a life saver.<p>At my next job I spent time programming from the back room of a retail store, stints in warehouses, and even with accounting. Then I could not just write code for them that made more sense, but even keep their goals in mind when working at a project with someone else.<p>At another job the company was doing heavy waterfall. The project I landed on had been going on for 2 years, but no developer had EVER talked to anyone in the user&#x27;s department. It all went through business analysts and project leads. Needles to say, the internals of the system had nothing to do with the user&#x27;s mental model, and the business analysts, which had no special training, were designing screens and answering questions, while they were badly informed. I used a fortuitous maternity leave by one of the leads to just spend a few days a week in another campus: One that had people that were not my users, but understood them far better than any analyst I had, and broke all protocol, redesigning some pieces of the system. When management came back, I told them that I wanted to show my changes to users, and they were ecstatic, as the changes were right on. A month later, my team was embedded with real business units, and management decided that, since we had better results than anyone else, that we could get away with not doing waterfall. All because I actually cared about what other people in the company were doing.<p>So sure, if you are sitting next to recruiting in an open office, and recruiting doesn&#x27;t go into any closed booths to take calls, it&#x27;s probably not so productive, but I have never worked at a place where getting to know what other departments are doing didn&#x27;t multiply my chances of having more impact."

comment,14270960,,,1493955599,,sandworm101,"Film and photography are too similar for such comparison.  Film is inclusive of photography.  Everything that can be done in photography can also be done in film, especially with today&#x27;s devices that display both as easily.  VR is different.  There are things in film that cannot be done in VR, as there are thing in VR that cannot be done in film.  But in terms of storytelling, VR is to film as the &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot; is to novels.  By allowing the viewer too much freedom to ignore one path for another, the artist&#x27;s message becomes lost.  To defend his message the artist will resort to trickery, extra efforts that detract from the work.  A Disneyworld ride can be fun, but we don&#x27;t expect anything near the depth we would from a film."

So civil disobedience is making a show of deliberately breaking a bad law in order to call attention to the fact that the law is bad, risking your own liberty in the process. Then when it goes to trial, a jury may decide that though you broke the law, you are in the right and acquit you. This power of &quot;jury nullification&quot; is also recognized in common law and while it may not actually nullify laws, it makes them more difficult to enforce and when they&#x27;re not enforced they are <i>effectively</i> void. A lot of the fun-fact ridiculous laws like &quot;it is illegal to kiss in public on Sundays&quot; are old laws which the local authorities can&#x27;t be bothered to enforce and so are not really <i>in</i> force.<p>But back to civil disobedience: it is an assertion through deed of human rights.

It depends on  lots of things.<p>2) &quot;The law&quot; is also too vague. Sometimes intent is relevant, sometimes its not; it just depends on what the law itself says.<p>3) Civil disobedience is not (as far as I know-there&#x27;s a lot of laws) a defense for law-breaking, but, it may mitigate punishment or liability for a human. This depends on many things, ranging from the law, to the jurisdiction, to the facts of the case.<p>4) The distinction I was trying to make was: unlike people, companies do not engage in civil disobedience and a court will not allow a company to claim otherwise, be it as  defense or as liability mitigation.<p>Hope that answers your question?"

Some are more or less annoying, depending on the perspective of the user and how they use it.<p>Most package managers are some form of automatic transmission. Some provide paddle shifting, some are CVT, some have two clutches and 9 gears, and some just basic four speed boxes of swirling fluid. Almost all of them are a nightmare for a regular person to maintain.<p>That&#x27;s part of why I use Slackware, which uses Pkgtool. It doesn&#x27;t track dependencies. It doesn&#x27;t resolve conflicts. It doesn&#x27;t roll back changes. It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything. And it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. The only time it ever gets in your way is if you intentionally break it. Of course, i&#x27;m on the extreme end of a &quot;power user&quot;, but the damn thing is so simple that even a total newbie can grok how it works and the potential for catastrophe if they misuse it (like a manual in a car).<p>Of the ~8 package managers I&#x27;ve used, RPM is the closest to a simple, coherent, complete system.

I imagine there are similar emails for every county, city that were actively citing drivers for legal violations.<p>Worse the drivers usually use a Lawyer selected and paid for by Uber, and guess what that lawyer isn&#x27;t some independent traffic lawyer it&#x27;s Uber&#x27;s FL lobbyist.

Not only did Uber build software that they used to evade authorities &amp; break local laws in multiple states and countries, but they profited from it (which has a variety of other RICO implications.)<p>2. Sure, corporations are people too, but, nonetheless, only people engage in civil disobedience. Related, for courts, a company that profits from violating of local laws is not a protester or freedom fighter battling injustice, it is criminal enterprise.<p>3. Charging Uber under RICO would by no means be unusual or a stretch; this is a quite run of the mill application of these laws. (eg see Preet Bharara&#x27;s RICO prosecutions:  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=preet+bharara+rico+prosections&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=preet+bharara+rico+prosecutions"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=preet+bharara+rico+prosectio...</a> )<p>4. This is unquestionably a federal matter, within the DOJ&#x27;s jurisdiction. Uber operates across state lines--and used Greyball in multiple jurisdictions. That said, Uber could &amp; likely will face criminal investigation in other jurisdictions.<p>5. Finally, this is definitely not Trump&#x27;s revenge on Travis.  Not only does it simply not work that way--USAs are independent &amp; it&#x27;d be beyond illegal, but this specific USA was appointed by Obama. (There were two Trump didn&#x27;t fire; USA Stretch is one of them)<p>(*And, yes, I am a lawyer. And, many years ago, I worked at the Department of Justice)"

comment,14270435,,,1493947348,,hackuser,"&gt; If a ride request was deemed illegitimate, Uber&#x27;s app showed bogus information and the requester would not be picked up, the employees told Reuters.<p>Ignoring the illegality of interfering with law enforcement, this is bad customer service. Not only would I resent the invasion of privacy, but that algorithm is going to have a meaningful number of false-positives. It&#x27;s a crappy way to deal with customers - if you think there&#x27;s a problem, tell them you are denying service.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine another business doing this. Does a restaurant just not bring food? An online store just not send the clothes? I know you are thinking about shadowbanning, which I also think is crappy, but at least it&#x27;s much less consequential."

There are two phases: the frustration phase, and the tedious phase. Bootstrapping it is an incredibly frustrating process - I restarted from scratch 5 times before any attempt ever got to the tedious phase. The tedious phase never ends. You have to make hundreds of packages to get to a usable desktop system. I&#x27;ve made 407 packages and I still don&#x27;t have a desktop to show for it (I&#x27;m hoping to get sway working tomorrow, I think I have about 30 packages left).<p>Still, I&#x27;ve finally gotten to a somewhat practical self-hosting system. My laptop runs it on the metal and all of the infrastructure (website, bugzilla, git hosting, mirrors) is on a server running my distro too. It&#x27;s taken almost a year of frustration, but it&#x27;s very rewarding."

But you can&#x27;t lose sight of the fact it&#x27;s not how such rules are generally applied in reality. The intent of the rule and the intent of the potential rule-breaker matter a lot.

comment,14270231,,,1493944689,,GavinMcG,"Do you have any special expertise or qualification in this area? I ask only because what you&#x27;re describing is a perfectly reasonable-sounding but naive view on how depression works.<p>It&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;easier&#x2F;more efficient = more emotional energy to get over depression&quot;. In fact, you might have it backwards. Therapies such as behavioral activation therapy[0] exploit the fact that our mood can <i>follow from</i> our behaviors. (You might be familiar with this, for example: force yourself to smile for thirty seconds, and see how your mood changes.)<p>I experience a chronic, mild to moderate form of depression called dysthymia[1]. For me, there are two things that can make a world of difference in how my day goes. One is leaving the house shortly after getting up, which prevents me from starting the day by flopping on the couch and wasting hours online, then feeling guilty. The other is taking a shower after getting up, because if I don&#x27;t, I generally won&#x27;t leave the house. Both of these actually take effort, especially some days, and your read on things would suggest that just <i>not doing them</i> would leave me more time and energy to &quot;try to get over&quot; my depression. But in fact, it&#x27;s precisely the immediate investment in myself and my day that makes the difference.<p>As it happens, cooking also ties in for me. I enjoy cooking, generally, and I feel proud of the food I cook for myself and especially for others. On the other hand, here&#x27;s what happens when I order a pizza: I feel guilty about being lazy, and I feel hopeless about the prospect of getting out of whatever funk I&#x27;m in when I can&#x27;t even get myself to put together a meal. That said, I take what I can get: I was alone a couple Thanksgivings ago, and had been in a low stretch for a few weeks, and it was a <i>victory</i> to make myself get up and go to the gas station for Bugles and Swedish Fish, rather than ordering in.<p>I&#x27;m telling you this personal stuff, which doesn&#x27;t feel terribly comfortable, because I <i>constantly</i> hear naive bullshit[2] about how depression works, and it is supremely unhelpful. It is not simple. And my experience isn&#x27;t going to be the same as anyone else&#x27;s. But the person who has to scrounge up a meal, pay bills, and take care of others could <i>absolutely</i> be doing better than the person who &quot;has it easy&quot;, because they&#x27;ve got structure, activities that get them out of their head, and others who they can be responsible for or even <i>live</i> for.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Soylent shouldn&#x27;t be on the market, and I&#x27;m not saying pizza shouldn&#x27;t be able to be delivered. But the idea that thinking about how all these factors fit together is &quot;silly&quot; and worth dismissing is really wrongheaded.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Behavioral_activation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Behavioral_activation</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dysthymia"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dysthymia</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;On_Bullshit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;On_Bullshit</a>"

comment,14269973,,,1493942070,,consz,"HFT firms make money by having sufficiently more accurate predictions of the future price than those they trade against -- here, for prediction, you can take any reasonable metric, such as the change in price in the next 10 seconds.

Their actual risks are operational (How Knight blew up) or the above situation no longer holding (How Getco, Teza, etc. died).<p>Also, one thing I have to mention in your post -- stock exchanges were not the market makers of the past. That role was played by someone called a specialist; you can think of them as doing exactly what an HFT market maker does these days, except far, far dumber and far, far slower.

This is going to be a ridiculously huge dataset, but bear with me. Then, use a genetic algorithm to evolve equations that have reasonably similar behavior, perhaps over a much smaller domain.<p>This collection of equations and their valid input ranges, are the raw material for your program. You would simplify them using algebraic solvers, when possible, and attempt to hand-optimize them for readability. Then, when you are done, the whole thing gets compiled down to big switch-case statement in, say, C. From here on, the process looks sort of like yacc.<p>So, by adding a whole new layer of magic, we get the system to explain itself in a way that a programmer could understand.

I was trying to ask a question about that point; do these companies really have no risk? Are they basically printing money?<p>I am sure the answer is no, because no company has zero risk. I want to know where the risk is, and I figured the answer to that question is answered by answering the &#x27;how do they make money on 51% of their trades&#x27; question.<p>That might not be the right question, but I don&#x27;t think my question was equivalent to asking &#x27;how do MARKET MAKERS make money on every trade&#x27;, because traditional market makers (i.e. the stock exchanges) are not the same as HFTs.

comment,14269835,,,1493940839,,Yetanfou,"In what way is it &#x27;elitist&#x27; to dislike the pablum ditched out by television channels? Strange, the way things go. It used to be that those who did not have a television set were seen as backwards but now it seems to be the opposite.<p>I never liked television programming, not as a child, not as an adult. There is nothing elitist about it, I just like doing things myself.<p>BTW, the mere fact that you&#x27;re replying to a message I submitted to this forum should tell you it I do not consider <i>everything that comes on a screen an unnecessary diversion</i>, given the fact that the probability of me using a screen to read and enter text here is rather high. Television is quite well-defined as being a medium designed for mostly passive consumption of entertainment and information. It is the combination of hardware and a whole industry to provide programming to animate those screens. It is the latter, the industry and its products, which I dislike. The hardware can be quite useful."

comment,14269673,,,1493939217,,wayn3,"I&#x27;m being called oblivious by people who confuse HFT and market making which each other. That&#x27;s cute.<p>There are companies that provide liquidity. They do nothing else. They don&#x27;t take a position in the market. Its their job to quote both a bid and an ask and to trade with anyone who wants to hit those quotes. They are not allowed to not quote a price, unless trading is suspended. Those are called market-makers. They need to be able to change their quotes quickly, because being taken out on one side of the market creates positional risk for them. The only time they make money is when they can trigger a buy and a sell at the same time. If they cant do that, they have to hedge their position. They have to compete on spread with other market makers, which is possible to do in 2 ways - being fastest to quote or having a narrower spread. Trades at the price are executed in the order of submission.<p>There are companies that engage in statistical arbitrage. They look for opportunities that are statistical in nature. Think of technical analysis but in a way that works. Think stock A and stock B being more correlated than price reflects. They want to execute fast because those opportunities do not exist for long. This kind of trading smoothens out the curve and smooth curves are nice to have, mathematically speaking.<p>There are HFT firms who scalp dodginess in price by renting colocated servers. Very tiny but almost guaranteed returns if they can get execution. Nothing wrong with that either. Low margin business model.<p>Then there are companies, or rather teams inside companies, that send buy and sell orders into the exchange that they never want to execute, on millisecond timescales, to disrupt the market. They are trying, in simplified terms, to create signals for other market participants that do not really exist, and then execute trades that they know will be profitable by exploiting other participants for whom they generated buy signals. This is your evil HFT. The T in HFT is a misnomer, because they dont really trade. They abuse stock exchange mechanics to fuck with other market participants and then try to rob them. This is mostly illegal and not allowed by the exchanges themselves. The problem here is to prove that someone didnt play by the rules. Google &quot;optiver the hammer&quot; for an example of a couple years ago. They have counter-intelligence teams whose entire job is to not trade the market for profit but to ruin other companies profits to drive them out of business. But most of this is illegal, its just difficult to prosecute.<p>The problem with banning folks is that most trading companies engage in all of these things at the same time. There are market making teams at optiver and there are evil HFT teams at optiver and if you ban optiver, you wipe out a major market maker which leaves the stock exchange exposed.<p>Another problem with &quot;banning HFT&quot; is that where do you draw the line? Market participants can suddenly not try to get their trades executed anymore? Maybe that&#x27;s beneficial to the market as a whole, but how do you even execute such a rule?"

So it is focused on a specific set of PDEs, by doing so you can apply optimizations that are specific to this PDEs and the space representation that it uses, this optimizations are not general to the underlying method of solution (which can actually be a combination of methods), so it will be extremely hard for this generic libraries to compete in performance with a focused solver."

comment,14269634,,,1493938846,,belorn,"I find it offputing when a business put people in jail because someone shared a exact copy of a program. That ideology is a large part why people put their work under gpl. As a fact, no person have ever been sent to jail for sharing a GPL&#x27;ed software with a friend. If you oppose people getting sent to jail or given fines that will last a person a life time, then it perfect rational not to help companies that do this. Some add clauses which says &quot;do no evil&quot;, others put common legal obstacles so the practical results will be that code aren&#x27;t used by them."

What is worth barring is the ability to pay them back out as dividends in exchange for the tax break.

comment,14269394,,,1493936492,,elihu,"There&#x27;s no conspiracy; programming in Haskell is the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had with a computer.<p>The &quot;if it compiles, it works&quot; thing describes people&#x27;s experience.  It isn&#x27;t always true and it isn&#x27;t a valid excuse not to do proper testing, but in Haskell a non-working solution is usually at least broken in a way that makes sense in the context of the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve.  If you program an incorrect solution to a problem, you&#x27;ll probably get a wrong answer.  But a wrong answer is different than nonsense, which is what you get if, say, you write past the end of an array in C.<p>The Haskell type system is a very good nonsense filter, and probably a majority of programming errors are from telling the program to do something nonsensical.  If you filter those out, sometimes what&#x27;s left is a working program.<p>A Haskell programmer is unlikely to write a several thousand line program and have it work correctly the first time, but even large programs are written in small pieces.  When those small pieces work correctly the first time, it&#x27;s gratifying."

comment,14269370,,,1493936336,,tetrep,"&gt; Companies should defer judgement to the courts rather than make arbitrary moral judgements.<p>Uh, no. Please no. I do <i>not</i> want the courts to arbitrate morality. That&#x27;s a far far far more dystopian world than one where corporations do (supposing I accept their false dilemma). Companies can, in theory, be created by any person, with any moral alignment. That is not the case with governments (minus authoritarian ones, which function in the context of moral-defining as more or less the same as a company).<p>Additionally, deferring to the courts also leads to the ever terrible &quot;this is moral because it is legal&quot; and &quot;this is immoral because it is illegal.&quot;<p>There is not a correct authority on morality to which you can defer. You cannot offload such decisions and wash your hands. Any moral decision you make, including deferring to some other moral-decider, is entirely your responsibility.<p>Note: I&#x27;m doing the naughty thing of morals=ethics. I know this is pedantically not the case, but I&#x27;m 99% sure that is what the article means. And, in general, this is also what everyone means outside of targeted discussions.<p>&gt; ...if someone is infected with spyware they&#x27;re probably better off infected with secure spyware.<p>I think this is a great ethical issue within the security community. There&#x27;s many arguments against working for a company you have ethical disagreements with, but that becomes much more grey when it comes to security. Sure I might not agree with the mass surveillance of the government, but wouldn&#x27;t I rather help the NSA not leave piles of malware sitting around on C&amp;C servers than let it be exposed to even more malicious actors?<p>Security could use a hippocratic oath.<p>&gt; FlexiSPY has not published a vulnerability disclosure policy or committed to no legal action against hackers. Both protective steps would be required should their program be hosted on HackerOne.<p>I&#x27;m surprised HackerOne doesn&#x27;t have a policy surrounding this already. Are hackers who submit issues to HackerOne not protected?<p>&gt; We will not take action against them based exclusively on moral judgements.<p>Hooray, kinda. I think this is a maxim that HackerOne could extend to not making moral judgements relevant at all, and to instead institute policies that reflect HackerOne&#x27;s current morals. This increases transparency and allows HackerOne to say &quot;We reject you because your company&#x27;s goals&#x2F;actions&#x2F;whatever explicitly contradict our policy that everyone wear unicorn hats on Tuesdays&quot;.<p>&gt; Their business conduct is not in line with our ambition to build a safe and sound internet where the sovereignty and safety of each participant is respected.<p>I think now would be a good time for HackerOne to write this stuff down. A <i>very</i> brief look at their site and the only thing I can see relating to this is the tagline &quot;Make the internet safer together.&quot; From which sovereignty implications can be drawn, but having such policies explicitly stated and publicly available not only allows for transparency in decisions, but also works as an advertisement, &quot;Oh hey, this company wants to protect my digital sovereignty, neat!&quot;"

The bitmap which Edge has rendered to the screen is not what will be sent to the printer driver. Instead, rich vector graphics will be sent. On Windows, the native print format is XPS, so this is most likely a bug in how Edge converts PDF to XPS for printing.<p>For simpler use cases Windows&#x27; graphics APIs can be used to both render to bitmap and to XPS but when printing something as rich and sophisticated as PDF better results are achieved by directly targeting the native print format, such as PCL, PostScript, or XPS. I suspect that&#x27;s what the Edge devs have done and why it&#x27;s producing different results on screen and in print."

comment,14269346,,,1493936132,,vostok,"I think you&#x27;re confused about how HFTs create value.

If the HFT wasn&#x27;t there then the investor&#x27;s order would just fill a bank&#x27;s order that would probably be wider and wouldn&#x27;t respond to changing situations as quickly.<p>The innovation is that HFTs are able to make better markets with fewer people.

You can do <i>habitual</i> things just fine; or procrastinative things. But, outside of those two activity-classes, it&#x27;s hard to even do the most <i>enjoyable</i> of things—like, for example, watching a serious, dramatic movie—because you won&#x27;t get anything out of such activities if you don&#x27;t invest some emotional energy into them, and you&#x27;ve just plum run out.<p>---<p>In a more technical sense, it&#x27;s my understanding that the activity of programming somehow &quot;uses up&quot; a lot of dopamine, and so gradually <i>depletes</i> one&#x27;s available store of dopamine over the course of the day in much the same way that stress, cold environments, and surprising loud noises are known to.<p>Thus, a neurotypical person who spends eight hours programming in a day, will end up effectively equivalent in behavior&#x2F;mentality to a person with ADHD for the rest of the day, until they can sleep it off and recover.<p>(This means you could probably restore your &quot;spoons&quot; by taking ADHD <i>medication</i> just after leaving work... but that seems ill-advised, for multiple reasons.)"

comment,14269256,,,1493935267,,_nullspace,"I recently tried Ample Original and AmpleX, and I like Ample Original quite a bit. The only other product I&#x27;ve tried is from Super Body Fuel, though that one had a pretty different macronutrient profile and required some preparation.<p>I agree that the focus on nutrition is a huge benefit. In addition, I appreciate the transparency of the company and what seems to be a desire to iterate and improve on their product. Today, they announced a few small tweaks to their formula and released a &quot;change log&quot; (their choice of word) detailing the reasons behind their choices.<p>Do you personally feel any physically different or have noticed any health improvements upon switching to Ample from Soylent?"
comment,14269253,,,1493935246,,wildermuthn,"Consciousness is vital to AI because there are vast amounts of data that can only be measured through consciousness — data that AI absolutely requires to solve the hardest human problems. This type of data is called &quot;qualia&quot; — the experience of pain, for example. An unconscious AI can process data about what causes pain: brain activity. Only a conscious AI can process data about pain itself, and only because a conscious AI measures pain from its own experience of pain.<p>The same can be said of any conscious experience that follows the spectrum from fear to love, terror to joy. If we want AI to solve human problems, it will need data about what it feels like to experience reality, and that data can only come by being conscious itself."

comment,14269241,,,1493935119,,hzhou321,"&gt;  furthermore, while you may be able to more quickly &quot;express an idea&quot; in a dynamically typed language, your ability to precisely enumerate the idea will be less than a statically typed one.<p>What we need realize is not all ideas are precise. In fact, most of our ideas are vague to certain extent. They are still OK as long as the vagueness does not matter to the problem of interest or it is already constrained or implied in the context. So to efficiently express an idea, both insufficiency or over specificness are negative to expressiveness. To disclaim, I don&#x27;t claim any language is the best to that regard. I believe language should be suited to the problem (as well as the experience of the team).<p>Since you particullarly mentioned type, I would suggest that not always a particular type is important in a idea. For example, sorting, the types of the items are not intrinsic in the idea. Having to specify the type contributes negatively to the expressiveness. However, when performance is concerned ragarding to certain specific sorting problem, types (as narrowly specific as we can) are of importance. However, we should recognize that is a different idea from the original idea of sorting. So even though in the program eventually it expresses both the algorithm for sorting as well as the types, being forced to mix ideas are negative toward expressiveness.<p>Haskell, its types and pureness, for example, are not always essential in a programming idea. Having to take care of these language requirement while it is non-essential, makes it less expressive (in those problem domain)."

They put up some product at a price, someone else on the other side of town sees a slightly different price because the market only moves at the speed of light.  Instead of the seller getting a little bonus, that bonus is hoovered up by the HFT guy in the middle who has a more accurate view of the market.<p>What service did the HFT provide?  Where did this mysterious liquidity come from?<p>In the old days the middlemen were responsible for actually finding the guy making the sale and matching him up with the buyer.

comment,14269178,,,1493934601,,myrandomcomment,"Wow. A personal attack. Way to make a point, not.<p>There is this statement that about 60% of bankruptcy are from medical debt. Here is a quick over view of that number:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;643000-bankruptcies-in-the-u-s-every-year-due-to-medical-bills&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;643000-bankruptcies-in-the-u-s-every-y...</a><p>So lets say it is true (it likely is) then what are the other 40% from?<p>The problem I have with your statements is that you make the companies out to be evil. They should know better and not lend anymore is what you are saying. However how does that work? Should that 60% that filled for the pure reason that someone got really sick not be able to get credit later? Should we have 2 classes of the ability to get credit after bankruptcy? &quot;Okay, well it was medical so no issues. Hey looks like you spent to much but you learned you lesson this time so I guess I will give you a loan. Hey you seem to have not learned your lesson so no loan for you.&quot; This is a slippery slope. How does a company value all of this? The answer is they cannot really. There is math behind the lending and it is faceless and has to be because anything else is subjective and could be discriminatory.<p>This is no different then:<p>&quot;Hey you should put limiters in to only let the car go the speed limit.&quot;<p>&quot;Hey you had enough soda this week. No more for you.&quot;<p>The company that lends the money can only profile on the finances and payment history. Anything else is really out of bounds. It is not the lenders job to KNOW that you cannot control your spending and they are not EVIL because they do not do so. They are not your parents.<p>You are blaming the company for something that is the persons responsibility. No one is saying that there are not bad situations were bankruptcy is required. All I was saying that doing it should not be easy. There is a reason a judge is required to rule on this."

(6. The same tastes are common to some animals much lower in the scale. Mr. A. Nichols informs me that he kept in Queensland, in Australia, three individuals of the Phaseolarctus cinereus [koalas]; and that, without having been taught in any way, they acquired a strong taste for rum, and for smoking tobacco.) Brehm asserts that the natives of north-eastern Africa catch the wild baboons by exposing vessels with strong beer, by which they are made drunk. He has seen some of these animals, which he kept in confinement, in this state; and he gives a laughable account of their behaviour and strange grimaces. On the following morning they were very cross and dismal; they held their aching heads with both hands, and wore a most pitiable expression: when beer or wine was offered them, they turned away with disgust, but relished the juice of lemons. An American monkey, an Ateles, after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it again, and thus was wiser than many men. These trifling facts prove how similar the nerves of taste must be in monkeys and man, and how similarly their whole nervous system is affected.<p>- &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;"

Another upside of having constantly inquiring &quot;explain me like I&#x27;m five&quot;-type son is that content of my brain&#x27;s RAM is instantly swapped out several minutes after I pick him at kindergarten. Bottom line: I rest better; spend less time; I&#x27;m more productive. (and earn more money)"

comment,14269061,,,1493933708,,BigChiefSmokem,"I perform very highly at work (pun intended) and have not seen continuous daily usage over the past ten years hamper my career or health in the same way drinking for the same amount of time would have caused (I drink maybe once every few months, and only in social situations, never alone). A lot of people where I work get high as well, roughly 3 out of every 4 engineers or so. This is probably not an industry average or even close to it but it is &quot;Stoners At Work&quot; for sure because this is the California culture, and as far as I can tell, California still produces some of the best tech products and tech teams on Earth and will continue to do so in spite of legalization. I think it might even be helping people with mental health issues, especially those dealing with severe stress and the quiet depression that is so pervasive in the tech industry.<p>The zone I get into when I code high is amazing. It feels like I&#x27;m Da Vinci re-incarnate, deeply thinking about my work. I seem to be able to piece things from long term memory better (although I will admit that short-term memory and situational awareness is severely hampered). It also takes away the clarity of sobriety but the level of concentration and depth of thought it grants your imagination is well worth it, and of course, is only temporary. It does amplify even the smallest instinct of hunger so I tend to do it after I eat, not before.<p>I also prefer to use it post-workout as it relaxes my muscles much better than anything else outside of a warm jacuzzi. I&#x27;m guessing the inflammatory response from the body also helps with recovery soon after a high-intensity workout. I haven&#x27;t looked at that aspect too deeply yet, I just know what my body tells me. The high itself is also amplified post-workout so you actually need to consume less to get the same effect as at rest.<p>These are my experiences, not science, but I&#x27;m guessing many others might share similar experiences. Note that I do not smoke marijuana, only vaporize it. Smoking in general is just bad internally and externally so I believe vaporizing or ingestion are the best methods."

CMake can discover libraries and it can build your code, but that assumes you&#x27;ve already fetched a dependency somehow. Sure, you can use system package managers, but these are different on every platform.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing a simple video game in C++ recently, using CMake to build. I wrote a little bit of code that fetches the few libraries I need in order to have a complete&#x2F;deterministic build process that works on linux&#x2F;windows&#x2F;mac. It lets me change versions (by specifying a new url to a source tarball).

It might help to think of it as tax credit that every citizen receives.  The credit barely puts a dent in the taxes paid by the 1%."

Things may very well cost fractions (1&#x2F;10?) of today once energy is free. It also may make automation completely more possible at scale.<p>However, the other issue with UBI is that the to pay this we need all the taxes today to create this $3T but if no one is working because they have UBI where does this $3T come from?
That is always the problem with complete socialism, who pays for it?<p>I personally think the best way to address the inequality is to keep leveraging the EITC. Make it no federal taxes or complete refund for all households under $50K and keep raising it until it works. Earn under $25K, no federal taxes plus $1K flat BI.

3. 12 minute walking commute (no buses, cars, or bikes)

comment,14268761,,,1493931515,,Jach,"Laziness can actually make things <i>faster</i> in some scenarios. Take Python2&#x27;s range() function for instance, which eagerly builds the entire list and returns it. range() is commonly used for for loops, so Python builds this list (an N operation) and returns it, and then the for loop iterates over it (another N operation). But if you use xrange(), you get a generator instead, which can lazily construct values when asked for one. It turns the for loop case into a single N operation. Similarly if you have nested function call chains, if everything is returning an eagerly evaluated list, you have to construct the whole list in memory at each call and pass it to the next stage which will eagerly iterate over the whole thing to generate its list in memory and so forth, eventually the old list can be freed &#x2F; GC&#x27;d when the new list has been made.. but with lazy sequences, you only need memory for the whole list at the very end, if you want it and not just individual values. Python3&#x27;s range() replaced Python2&#x27;s with xrange(). (The other option is a numpy-like approach where you eagerly allocate the list and then every stage just mutates that single thing.)<p>The &#x27;memory stays around indefinitely&#x27; problem is caused by not cleaning up references to generators. You can make your own xrange() clone in Python easily, and start consuming values, but if you stop before consuming all of them (assuming it&#x27;s not an infinite generator), that xrange() generator object still lives and has to keep around whatever references it needs to generate the next value if you ask it for one. When your whole language is based around laziness, you might have a lot of these and it may not be clear what references are still around that keep the GC from cleaning them up.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say reasoning about performance is necessarily more difficult, and profiling will light up a slow part of a lazy pipeline just as well as an eager one. My own struggles with laziness in Clojure were all around my own confusions about &quot;I thought this sequence was going to be evaluated, but it wasn&#x27;t!&quot; which may have led to unnecessary calls to (doall), which forcibly walks a sequence and puts the whole thing in memory."

comment,14268734,,,1493931367,,benbreen,"Since most of the text you linked is describing a specific painting, it seems to me that the most relevant quote from it is the following: &quot;Fettered monkeys, like this one, are traditionally used to symbolize man entrapped by earthly and sensual desires.&quot;<p>Which is along the lines with what I wrote as well: &quot;Desire is a dominant theme in these works...  these paintings are working through the idea that newly-available psychoactive substances -- and, perhaps, material objects as well -- could dehumanize those who consumed them, reducing them to an animalistic level. Such consumers, it is implied, had moved down a step on the chain of being, having lost their powers of reason and been reduced to creatures that were &#x27;sentient&#x27; in the original sense of the word: unable to think, and content simply to feel.&quot;<p>What I was trying to point out is that this specific sub-genre of images were reflecting new ideas about addiction (since the substances they&#x27;re consuming were new to most 17th century consumers) <i>in addition to</i> the more general association of monkeys with sensuality&#x2F;desire in early modern art, and the desire to use silly animals to satirize. I don&#x27;t think its snarky at all to point out that the latter is an existing interpretation, but it&#x27;s one that I was aware of when writing.<p>The reason why the topic matters to me is that I&#x27;ve lately become interested in the invention of the modern concept of addiction and the way we as a society grapple with it, which I think has some real world implications in terms of the legal system and in anticipating potential societal problems in the future, like the dopamine hits we all seem to get from things like Candy Crush (or being on the front page of HN)."

comment,14268707,,,1493931221,,SomeStupidPoint,"Particles don&#x27;t create a medium, they&#x27;re constructed out of perturbations in a medium, eg fields. Your paraphrase in quotes isn&#x27;t <i>anything</i> like what I actually said in my post -- you dropped key words from it.<p>What I actually said, and you misunderstood: &quot;the medium they&#x27;re creating the signal in&quot;. Your paraphrase is so far from that, I have trouble even addressing the confusion. It&#x27;s particularly egregious that you omitted key words when you&#x27;re clearly using them to make passive aggressive comments about <i>my</i> understanding.<p>The answer to how this addresses the question is that the medium <i>is</i> experiential -- anything that creates effects in it is &#x27;experiencing&#x27;. <i>Experiencing</i> seeing blue corresponds to a particular pattern of activity in the medium. (Though, there is no default &#x27;experience of seeing blue&#x27; -- it&#x27;s possible that we experience different ones, different animals have different ones, etc. This relates back to the computational structure.)<p>How entanglement is involved is that there&#x27;s a single &#x27;unified&#x27; experience when we know that different portions are generated in different brain regions, but don&#x27;t (obviously) converge the information to a point (eg, it&#x27;s always spread at least in a cluster of neurons), which suggests that we&#x27;re talking about something non-localized in the medium, ie, not a point object.<p>The source of a lot of non-locality is through entanglement, so it&#x27;s reasonable to conjecture that it&#x27;s involved here, as well -- though, of course, it could be a different mechanism.<p>If the pieces of your brain which are generating the perturbation in the experiential medium(s) are entangled, it could provide a model of how it&#x27;s carrying a non-localized piece of information -- your experience."

comment,14268647,,,1493930894,,dmix,"&gt; The inequality that you see today wasn&#x27;t caused by globalism, but by tax cuts on the very rich<p>Source?<p>Only a minority of companies in the US even have executives that get the much maligned high pay and bonuses in the last decade or so. What about the massive percentage of wealth that didn&#x27;t fall into this category? They may have gain significantly from globalism but that was hardly the result of US tax policy alone.<p>Lets not forget that democrats were in power for the last 8yrs and the state has only grown exponentially since the 1990s under both republican and democrat governments. Just because tax rates weren&#x27;t the extremes of pre-1980&#x2F;1970s doesn&#x27;t make them low. They&#x27;ve been relatively consistent while the middle class income dropped.<p>The complexity of the tax code and lack of competitiveness with international countries may have heavily influenced inequality. But it was hardly the result of explicit tax reduction for the rich...<p>The idea that tax havens are something that were merely a matter of weak policy is naive. Even worse than the drug war hawks.<p>Just because the middle class didn&#x27;t keep pace with the wealthy doesn&#x27;t mean only the wealthy were at fault. The fact the middle class lost wealth is hardly singularly the fault of the wealthy. I know this narrative sells well in politics but it&#x27;s very short sighted.<p>Even if the US adjusted tax policy to redistribute a larger chunk of taxes towards the middle class it would hardly make a dent in the new reality in the fact there is hardly a middle class economy like there used to be. So you must either develop a new middle class economy or you get temporary perks of taking it from the wealthy. This is the big whale in the room that the Bernie bro guys are ignoring. The likely scenario is that the wealthy would become continually less competitive over the years, shift way more money over seas, and the middle class would be in the same situation with a little bit more money for a short period.<p>Gov spending under any administration that enacts those policies would largely offset most of the gains going directly to the people regardless (which is good if it results in universal health care, but little else if it&#x27;s not sustainable)."

You use Python and Fortran. For example, you use NumPy and SciPy, which make Python a great high-level platform for numerical computing because they wrap large amounts of Fortran code.<p>&gt; You are mistaken. NumPy does not contain Fortran in it&#x27;s code base. SciPy does but it only makes up 25% of the SciPy code base. I have no doubt that within the next 20-50 years that will slowly be removed bit by bit.
Wrapping a legacy library is the first step to replacing it.

comment,14268401,,,1493929171,,chickenbane,"Obviously the first problem is most users (almost 2&#x2F;3) aren&#x27;t using M+.  However, that being said I do want to clear up some of your points about user agency.<p>It is true app makers are happy to ignore recommendations, but users with M+ are much more empowered.  So, for example, if the app makes permission requests repeatedly, on the 2nd ask Android will provide the &quot;Never ask again&quot; check to auto deny permission requests.  So if an app is being annoying about a permission you (the Android user) don&#x27;t want to give you can silence the app.<p>Also, you can always deny individual permissions after you&#x27;ve granted them, which also includes apps that don&#x27;t target M+.  So if you don&#x27;t think an app should require the Contacts permission then you can deny only that permission.  You can argue that this is a &quot;power user&quot; feature, but if you&#x27;re interested in app permissions I think M+ gives you the appropriate levers.  And surprisingly, I&#x27;ve seen the developers who fix their app if enough users uninstall it and leaving a review citing poor permissions."

comment,14268347,,,1493928786,,ben_jones,"From a practical perspective I doubt it. While weed will have higher pricing you won&#x27;t see the same quantity of people binging on weed like they do on liquor. You&#x27;ll have many places of employment discriminate against it (it can stay in the blood stream for a month). Many people don&#x27;t enjoy the sensation versus alcohol. It doesn&#x27;t cause the same chemical dependencies, don&#x27;t underestimate how much money bars and stores make from &quot;regulars&quot; known to the rest of us as alcoholics.<p>Finally and perhaps most important their is a huge logistical cost to being in the THC industry. Regulations at the local and state levels can take a healthy business and make it shut its doors in less then a week. Payment portals get frozen. Limits to growers, shippers, etc. keep pricing very high. I&#x27;ve yet to meet an un-affluent heavy user who doesn&#x27;t still buy from a dealer because of pricing.<p>P.S. don&#x27;t forget the religious and cultural push-back against weed. We accept beer advertising as normal, that won&#x27;t happen with weed in most places. No superbowl commercials for Gorilla Glue."

comment,14268335,,,1493928730,,zzzzzzzza,"haskell is objectively expressive. (where expressive means amount of logic per character)<p>there are multiple reasons for this, kind&#x27;ve tied together. Whitespace is function application (no parenthesis to keep track of like lisp, or even e.g. c, java, or javascript, when programming in a functional style). Immutability forces you to compartmentalize and compose everything. when everything is a function, function and variable names serve as VERY powerful documentation, especially when combined with haskell&#x27;s also VERY powerful type system (which e.g. has sum types where most languages do not, which allows for example, defining most error states of program as a data type (which can then derive from any typeclass)).<p>one of the primary benefits of laziness is to make function composition possible under a wider variety of situations (which also increases expressiveness, at the cost of occasional though not difficult to avoid space leaks)<p>one joke I&#x27;ve heard is that the ideal haskell program is 20 lines of imports and one line of perl."

Because anybody who has programmed a long enough time has had to switch languages to keep up with ever-evolving technology.<p>You&#x27;re right, a lot of people on HN who started coding around 2013 when the web&#x2F;mobile bubble started inflating learned JS and haven&#x27;t touched anything else.<p>If you&#x27;ve been coding since the 1990s or even 2000s, JS was definitely not your first language (ECMAScript wasn&#x27;t anywhere close to being capable of doing the things it is now up to even 2006), and so you&#x27;re likely equipped with the necessary skill set to build a real desktop app.<p>So even if you learned JS as your first language, it&#x27;s not TOO unreasonable to be expected learn something else like Python, C#&#x2F;.NET, or C++ that is a bit more suited for desktop app development.<p>But, yes, when you have a market flooded with JS developers and bootcamp grads, THAT is the forcing function for using Electron because C++ developers are now VERY tough to hire. They&#x27;re all doing the most hardcore infrastructure projects at the likes of Facebook, or they&#x27;re working on bare-metal performance optimization at NVIDIA, or they&#x27;re working on ML infrastructure for self-driving cars, or they&#x27;re doing high frequency trading in New York.<p>Your run-of-the-mill seed-stage startup just doesn&#x27;t have the budget for someone who knows C++ really well because even the big companies struggle finding and hiring them. With things like pointers and DIY memory management, C++ programming is HARD and easy to shoot yourself in the foot by making simple mistakes that aren&#x27;t even possible to make in higher-level languages like JS.<p>Luckily, there&#x27;s plenty of other languages out there for building real desktop apps that aren&#x27;t JS or C++."

All that wealth was then funneled into influencing the govt. to fuck American labor (i.e. ridiculously low minimum wage, further tax cuts for rich, less benefits for the needy etc.).<p>Globalism is an easy straw man to blame for inequality, but its actually allowed people with stagnant incomes to maintain a certain standard of living (or not let it deteriorate too fast) via cheaper goods and services."

comment,14268038,,,1493926873,,rspeer,"These are some pretty naive suggestions for how to uproot an entire domain of computing.<p>Julia is a JIT language. Whatever edge you get in pretty code is going to be paid for in speed. Also, it&#x27;s pre-1.0 and breaks compatibility frequently. 40-year-old Fortran code runs fine; 2-year-old Julia code is a syntax error.<p>Rust is a nice language, but all of its numerical computing is experimental 0.x stuff. You&#x27;ll probably end up wrapping another library to do your number crunching. It&#x27;s probably written in Fortran.<p>C++ has pointer aliasing shenanigans, so it&#x27;s hard to make it as efficient as Fortran. I have seen a couple of projects that tried to port Fortran libraries to C++. They came out slower, buggier, and less readable. The only reason you&#x27;d want to do that is a specific hatred for Fortran -- which you are not the only one to have, but over the decades it hasn&#x27;t proven to be a good motivation for redesigning software.<p>Of course people like to use Python, but you don&#x27;t get to use Python <i>instead</i> of Fortran. That would be incredibly slow. You use Python <i>and</i> Fortran. For example, you use NumPy and SciPy, which make Python a great high-level platform for numerical computing because they wrap large amounts of Fortran code. If you use Python for numerical computing, you are not &quot;moving away from Fortran&quot;, you&#x27;re embracing its success.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know Fortran, but I have huge respect for the people who do. They&#x27;re the reason most of the things I do are possible and fast."

The two are related, but not the same. You can be for free trade of goods and services, but not for unelected central powers (i.e. an EU, a central bank).<p>Mainstream academic economists are typically free trade, but we have no science to test this theory so just br careful about drinking too much of the kool aid. LarGe corps, banks, and US gov generally want globalism. Keep in mind why they want that (profit and power). We still have a lot of people suffering in 2017 and no longer a good excuse for it (i.e. resources scarcity cant explain malnutrition anymore)."

I like Valve and Bethesda games too.<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen exact figures, but you are severly underestimating how much cheddar people drop on stuff like Team Fortress 2 items.<p>I don&#x27;t have exact figures either, but whatever people spend on hats cannot possibly approach what people have spent on WoW subscriptions...<p>According to Wikipedia, Valve&#x27;s total equity is $2.5 billion while Activision Blizzard&#x27;s is $8.068 billion. Obviously, one produces many more games, but I still have a hard time picturing something like TF2 coming close to the amount of revenue that WoW or Hearthstone generates.<p>&gt; WoW had the same feel as W3, just with a different camera position and WASD movement.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to say that WoW and WC3 are similar games. One is an RTS and the other is an MMORPG. When I called Valve&#x2F;Bethesda games are similar, I was talking about how Valve games all feel like thin skins over the Source of Gamebryo engines. It feels like you could walk out of the facility in Portal into City 17.<p>&gt; Look at a game like CounterStrike. I remember getting into that game 18 years ago!!! and it&#x27;s still one of the most popular esports, twitch channels, is even on cable TV, and still makes boatloads of money.<p>Counter Strike is a great game. I&#x27;ve been playing it all my life, since 1.6. But you know how much money I&#x27;ve spent on Counter Strike over the years? Probably much less than I&#x27;ve spent on Overwatch loot boxes plus the game, and that game only came out last year.<p>&gt;  HotS (yawn, bad design philosophy to leveling up as a team<p>As someone who is a 1x MOBA player, I like HOTS. I find the way that experience is combined makes games a little bit more competitive but also less toxic (No all chat helps too :)).<p>&gt; I really don&#x27;t care much for PvP FPS experiences, which is why Overwatch, while a fantastic game that actually gets me to play PvP, is unsatisfying. I much prefer co-op games and I really liked the horde mode, but they make it seasonal...so I haven&#x27;t touched it in months.<p>They have a story-mode coop now, Overwatch Origins. I&#x27;m not interested in it, so I haven&#x27;t played, but it sounds like it might be up your alley.<p>&gt; Did they resent the creation of DotA, say to themselves never again, and decide to completely abstain in creating modder tools?<p>Yes, I do think they regretted not capturing the value created by Dota.<p>I don&#x27;t think Blizzard games are perfect, I just think their strategy is obvious. Blizzard is going to approach modding with the same care and caution that Nintendo approaches mobile games."

This involves stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the antagonist, so to speak, of the sympathetic nervous system.<p>A few years ago a company called Ardian had a minimally-invasive system called renal redervation for destroying the sympathetic nerves to the kidneys, in the hope that it would cure high blood pressure. Initial unblinded single armed trials were favourable, and so Ardian made $1,000,000,000 selling to Medtronic.<p>Lo and behold, in the double-blinded randomised trial, renal denervation did absolutely nothing.<p>Renal denervation was fuelled by optimism and bluff about the role for these nervous systems in disease. Shock horror, however, when manually altering them with a blunt tool such as ablation (in the case of renal denervation) or stimulation (the example here), doesn&#x27;t actually help.<p>The whole saga of renal denervation was one of the greatest examples of bad science and optimism getting ahead of us.

comment,14267918,,,1493926165,,drostie,"Your frustration in your first sentence I would equate to a general human frustration that we all feel when we see our own sins reflected in others -- you don&#x27;t back up your claim so you get mad at me for not backing up my claim. I could in turn make a really good case that the burden of proof is not on the person who says &quot;he doesn&#x27;t make that argument&quot; to prove that he doesn&#x27;t, but on the person who says &quot;he makes that argument&quot; to prove that he does. And then we can go back and forth in negativity, I suppose.<p>In an attempt to avert that spiral of world-suck, let me attempt to instead meet your request head-on. Penrose is not saying what you say he&#x27;s saying, and would not be able to fill up two books with your argument.<p>Let&#x27;s talk hacker for a second. What you&#x27;re saying is that Penrose is basically saying &quot;well I don&#x27;t understand this bug in my computer program, and I don&#x27;t understand the kernel in my computer, so therefore a kernel bug is causing this bug in my computer program.&quot; You are going to be predisposed to see any reduction of a bug towards the kernel as being evidence that yes, your characterization of the argument is correct and the argument is indeed laughable. This is understandable if someone just told you that hypothesis off-the-cuff, which I surmise is how you&#x27;ve probably encountered Penrose. (That is, I take the fact that you&#x27;re laughing as evidence that you&#x27;ve not read both <i>The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind</i> and <i>Shadows of the Mind</i>.) The alternative however, is that someone has (a) a high-level statement of &quot;this shouldn&#x27;t be happening&quot;, and (b) knows that the only way that such things <i>can</i> happen, barring things like the MMU misbehaving, is a kernel bug, and (c) has been attempting to trace down the code to the fundamental syscalls, and found that the thing-that-shouldn&#x27;t-be-happening is indeed bracketed around one syscall in particular which does not seem to be doing what the docs say it should do. And if a hacker has attempted all of this, I mean, they might still be wrong: but their argument is no longer something of the form &quot;I don&#x27;t understand the kernel and I don&#x27;t understand this bug, therefore the kernel caused this bug.&quot; It is something more sophisticated than that, and you&#x27;re doing a disservice by laughing at them.<p>One and a half of Penrose&#x27;s books are ultimately about why the computationalist&#x2F;algorithmist thesis of brain function seems deeply incomplete -- that a hallmark of some certain examples of reasoning appears to be deeply nonalgorithmic. (For example <i>The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind</i> supplements his usual Godel argument with arguments that if brain plasticity comes from local neural plasticity then it is unlikely to have a great generality, but by a clever analogy if it does have a great generality then not only does that mesh with an idea of global plasticity, but it is very unlikely to be algorithmic. The one and a half books are basically full of little digs that, seen together, <i>do</i> seriously undermine faith in the thesis.) This is essentially the &quot;bug&quot; above. His favorite example is that we are capable of proving to our own mathematical understanding that our mathematical-understanding-algorithm contains true sentences which we will never be able to prove; if this algorithm exists then it is able to prove something that it will never be able to prove, which seems like a straightforward contradiction. But there are one and a half pop-sci books  that he&#x27;s written building up some other problems with this thesis in a way that even if you don&#x27;t start off with knowledge of the relevant physics&#x2F;comp-sci&#x2F;whatever, you can hopefully understand it enough to appreciate the problem.<p>He follows these up with a principled dive into what&#x27;s actually underlying these &quot;bugs&quot;. That is, he discards ideas about souls and takes it seriously that our reasoning is realized in our brain, and takes seriously that this is a biochemical system, and evaluates whether the noncomputable phenomena that he is &quot;debugging&quot; can come from chaos or randomness or the like. He is able to rule most of these out with auxiliary considerations, and so tries to get one level closer to the hardware: the biochemsitry is well-modeled, we know, by physical chemistry; there are likely no new fundamental interactions or whatever to be found in biochemistry.<p>Looking into the physical chemistry level he finds that it can be somewhat cleanly divided into two parts: quantum and classical. Technically, it&#x27;s all quantum: but you can handle a lot more with various classical rules of thumb, and this has basically all been done before him so he can just steal those results:the classical part of physical chemistry and probably even the vast majority of the quantum part of physical chemistry are algorithmic, it is known that quantum computers don&#x27;t do other things than what computers do; they just might do many things more quickly. There exists only one part of the quantum part of physical chemistry which is not.<p>Unfortunately, he doesn&#x27;t have access to the source code,  nor docs for what nature does--so he actually constructs physical-chemistry models that could hypothetically do the sort of buggy things that he&#x27;s seeing at the top-level that he has carefully ruled out at the other levels of explanation.<p>And this is all to say: as you can hopefully now see, these books contain a lot more than simply &quot;we don&#x27;t understand X, we don&#x27;t understand Y, therefore Y causes X.&quot; Namely there is an actual understanding for example that X is realized in a system which <i>has to be modeled</i> with Y, and which has some features that <i>can only come from</i> certain corresponding features in Y, which we actually do understand very well. There has been a solid amount of good effort to push down that causal chain until one is left at these syscalls and then saying &quot;something is fishy about those.&quot; And his argument might indeed be wrong, there are many little parts where maybe he&#x27;s wrong about how chaos works and how it could cause a similar bug, just as our programmer above might be wrong about whether two processes are properly synchronized via locks or whatever -- but it&#x27;s no longer this laughable thing of &quot;ha, he doesn&#x27;t understand X and Y so he thinks Y causes X!&quot; that you&#x27;re trying to say."

Under 5% unemployment doesn&#x27;t mean anything if you can find enough salt-of-the-earth middle class white people who are struggling, because that is enough to convince people to toss the whole system and start over even if unemployment is low and wages are increasing.<p>It is truly staggering to have the right now taking on the mantle of income inequality after decades of obstructing any efforts to tackle it, so they can bring back the kinds of jobs that unions helped to define the middle class with after being instrumental in destroying unions all while blaming the left. I know its not quite that cut and dried but I think the left feels like that globalism is OK as long as you are distributing the wealth made from it. It seems like the republicans right now are willing to make us less wealthy and less well off in many ways, as long as the white middle class can benefit (even if the country suffers in general)."
comment,14267852,,,1493925681,,bronzeage,"The &quot;it will be found and abused&quot; argument is wrong on so many levels. Let&#x27;s start with the facts:

- That backdoor is called the private key for software updates. 
- Despite being well known feature, no criminals have abused it so far, and we consider it completely safe.
- The argument of &quot;it can&#x27;t be done&quot; is actually null and void. It was already done and even implemented.
- Why do you trust those companies more than your government. I don&#x27;t see how a corrupted cop is more likely than a corrupted developer. Being a developer obviously makes your point of view biased. 
- Where the government can be limited by whatever laws you choose to implement, those companies and their security practices are entirely up to them.
- It&#x27;s not a question of whether it&#x27;s possible, it&#x27;s a question of whether it should be done, and if so how.
- Open source is not much more trustable. End of the day most of the sane people do not recompile every binary, and with CVEs and security patches coming all the time you still need someone to provide the updated binaries."

comment,14267711,,,1493924609,,ue_,"&gt;I do not consider capitalism a &quot;thing&quot;. Free Markets generate winners and losers.<p>Markets are different from capitalism. The fact that you don&#x27;t consider it a stage of human history is strange, as capitalism has origins in a series of historical events. The Wikipedia article on capitalism is very good for this.<p>&gt;obfuscates that and tries to reason that there is some oppressive force, exhibited by a ruling class, over the peasantry<p>No, Marx talks about the bourgeoisie and the proletariat being the two classes which engage in struggle in our capitalist society. However class struggle is not unique to capitalism, it is, as Marx describes, the history of all struggle hitherto. Now there are other minor classes aside from these in society, as there were in Marx&#x27;s time - the petit-bourgeoisie and the lumpenproletariat. However peasantry was largely used to describe the feudal mode of production.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t think feudalism is a thing in the present, at least not in central europe.<p>Many parts of the world had not yet emerged from the feudal mode of production around Marx&#x27;s time, and large swathes had not even seen large industry expansion. Even in Lenin&#x27;s time, the functions of capital were not as developed in Russia as they were in other European nations (Germany and England being those leading the industrial revolution); in fact, Lenin split with his contemporaries on this, those opposed to him, the Mensheviks, believing that Russia had not reached capitalism yet, thus a revolution would be inappropriate and doomed to failure.<p>&gt;&quot;Morals as a concept are installed by rulers to keep their sheep in check, deal with it&quot;.<p>Marx also talks about the common forms of morality, family, justice etc. as bourgeois distinctions, as do his contemporaries such as Max Stirner and Bakunin.<p>&gt;Marxism and Communism may be closer to each other than anarchism and communism<p>Marxism is not a form of society, it is a method of analysis, which originated in political economy but has since been carried over to various other fields, ranging from geography to literature. Communism implies an anarchist society, as Communism is to do away with rulers, including those rulers of land.<p>&gt;There is no autocratic rule in the free world.<p>I was referring to the method of organisation within a company or firm, not how countries are organised. In terms of country political systems, those which are parliamentary democracies are, according to the Marxist analysis, bourgeois democracies, to perpetuate and ensure the survival of the flow of capital.<p>&gt;But at what point do people accept that every time a country tried communism, everything went to shit?<p>It depends, some take this position, and others do not. Communism and its sisters, including syndicalism, took root, such as in revolutionary Spain in which 2 million people were engaged in large-scale worker unions, with no bureaucracy, all voluntarily engaging. Same is the case with the third French revolution, when Paris was split into 48 communes, each coordinating with regular meetings the affairs of the revolution.<p>I think you have an uncharitable view of Communism or similar ideologies, especially given the much changed nature of our world since those times of revolution in the early 20th and late 19th centuries. Don&#x27;t you think it should be up to modern day Marxists and indeed leftists of any and all persuasions to find and fix those errors?<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t feel particularly exploited, btw. We live in a very free world. If you don&#x27;t want to sell your time, just don&#x27;t do it. Start your own company. See how that goes.<p>Whether you feel exploited or not is irrelevant. This can be attributed to commodity fetishism and false consciousness as elaborated by Engels. Most people (especially in developing countries) do not have the opportunity to move out of the situation of selling labour-power for a wage, and even if most people did, there are still those who must do it. Just as the answer in a feudal system isn&#x27;t &quot;make everyone a lord&quot;, the answer within capitalism isn&#x27;t to make everyone a property owner. There is not sufficient property (in particular land capital) to do this, anyway. Capitalism also requires large amount of wage labour, which would not be possible if the whole world were self employed, and we would resort to a bourgeois commodity exchange economy. Those born to parents without any land will not have any land. This is unfair in my eyes.<p>&gt;Somehow, those who are too weak, or preoccupied with other things, are blaming those who did try, for the fact that they have relatively easy lives.<p>Hard work does not give reward, at least not within capitalism. This can be shown by those people who not only take large risk but they work hard too, and they&#x27;re <i>still</i> wage labourers. And what perpetuates this? The system of property ownership. This had been identified indeed as far back as Rousseau and propagated and identified by all those anarchists and Communists through the 19th century.<p>Further, we do not blame those who try, we blame those who, in contempt of the idea that every man is born equal and free, hold property for their own profits. It is possible to try and succeed without holding property.<p>&gt;If there had never been an option to become rich in the first place, how many of those guys would have pulled a Picasso instead and just painted?<p>This is ridiculous. People generally want to follow their passions, you are forgetting that a lot of development in technology happened when capitalism wasn&#x27;t about, and indeed the scientists and inventors worked only because they were not oppressed by the rule of wage labour. Oscar Wilde talks about this in his book <i>The Soul of Man Under Socialism</i>. Those great inventors of the past usually did not work for profit at all, they worked out of the flame lit by curiosity, only resorting to the force of work when they had no money - again as a result of capitalism only affording people good life if they own property.<p>&gt;the worst peasant today lives like a god, compared to the richest of the rich just 100 years ago.<p>And that&#x27;s still not good enough. Saying that conditions have improved is just like saying &quot;well, it could be worse&quot; - in other words, the fallacy of relative privation."

There are lots of philosophical reasons to think that this is the case for <i>some</i> aspect of reality (or perhaps fields in general, even).<p>This would give us a science of experience and allow us to categorize and create new experiential beings. That&#x27;s a goal that many of us have.<p>Now, for various reasons, we might suppose a medium we&#x27;re already aware of (or mediums in some combination -- as is the position of the materialist). Then the question becomes entirely about the integration mechanism, as that&#x27;s the only piece of the puzzle we don&#x27;t know.<p>So if you&#x27;re a materialist, the integration of brain patterns in to a signal which corresponds to subjective experience is <i>the</i> question of creating new &#x27;souls&#x27; (in the sense of beings who experience), and also of categorizing what exactly has a &#x27;soul&#x27; (in the sense of inner experience).<p>The problem is how the computational structure which produces our behavior couples to our experience of it, which is a consistent, evolving perturbation in <i>something</i>, even if just in the sense of being a quasiparticle formed of the constituent parts interacting.

Fortran also misses out on a HUGE optimization that can be provided by the existence of explicit inlining from C&#x2F;C++ and implicit optimizations from things like C++&#x2F;Rust. There&#x27;s also constexpr from C++ which, in C++17, will offer huge benefits to non-trivial code.<p>Most formulas can be expressed as an inline function or constexpr and as a result can, in some cases, see huge performance improvements from compiler optimizations.<p>&gt; Compared to Java, C#, or Python, or any other JVM language, it has the advantage of compiling to machine code for every relevant supercomputer and cluster architecture.<p>You can do this with Python.

comment,14267327,,,1493922099,,tathougies,"&gt; They&#x27;re very useful, but try to avoid code that requires your coworkers to know abstract algebra and category theory in order to contribute to a project.<p>Have you ever learned a &#x27;design pattern&#x27; in Java, Python, C++, etc? What&#x27;s the difference between learning this and learning about monoids (for example). Monoids are super easy and actually compose, unlike the majority of design patterns. In my experience, learning OO design patterns was substantially more difficult than learning algebra, but I think this is mainly due to how CS education is carried out in many universities. I feel if people start with mainly FP, then OOP is what seems odd and necessitating learning odd, abstract concepts, except there&#x27;s the added bonus that all the abstractions are leaky.<p>Ultimately though, you don&#x27;t even need to learn any algebra or category theory. It was multiple years after I had already learned and started using Haskell that I even began to become interested in these topics. My interest was mainly piqued by a desire to not duplicate code -- it certainly isn&#x27;t required to learn algebra to understand Haskell, in the same way it&#x27;s not required to understand machine assembly to program in C++, or GPU transistor layout to understand OpenGL.<p>&gt;  a general sense often require more cryptic constructs as scaffolding.<p>My professional experience is mainly as a Haskell dev.

Failure is often misinterpreted by many as a stopping point or a place where we throw in the towel or hang up our boots, instead of it simply being a checkpoint to gain knowledge and understating on how to approach the task at hand in a better way.
Gaining knowledge about a goal, purpose, plan or the changes we want to see in our life or career helps us to either avoid failure or acts as an encourager to us when we find ourselves at the point of giving up.
Join me this Friday at 9pm GMT when I discuss the importance of gaining the proper knowledge in any area or field of desire we want to achieve, the knowledge that will enable us to build confidence and a solid frame of belief in ourselves, towards achieving or plan, purpose or desired outcome.

Recall earlier he mentions that if you have a social network and your retention is 5% it probably isn&#x27;t going to work out, but if you have a high end apparel business 5% retention could mean a good business.<p>The graph he presents has a blue line which demonstrates number of people in the system (100% today, 0% 250 days ago).<p>The pink line is the total revenue of everyone using the ad service on the 30&#x2F;31st day divided by the number of signups 30&#x2F;31 days ago.

comment,14267210,,,1493921185,,jliptzin,"This is basically what happens when capitalism is allowed to run wild. Massive industries consolidate into a few major players who have immense power over their workers. In this case, manufacturers realized that it&#x27;s more economical to manufacture in China than in the US so that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been doing. Simple economics. They owe nothing to the workers, only the shareholders. The manufacturing centers of the American rustbelt lost, and when you lose in a purely capitalist system, it&#x27;s pretty shitty. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens. Trump certainly won&#x27;t bring back their jobs in any meaningful way. The only way that will happen is if it becomes economical for companies to manufacture here again vs. China.

comment,14267207,,,1493921167,,dmix,"So basically you think the US government has been highly influential in developing &#x27;globalism&#x27; and it&#x27;s not entirely a natural phenomenon as a result of air travel, telecommunications, mature financial markets, lack of global war&#x2F;conflict, the opening of the east to global markets, etc?<p>Most of the things you mention, poor enforcement of tax havens, immigration policy, low taxes on capital, massive military spending, coincided with the development of globalism or were a reaction to it.<p>But regardless I disagree with your thesis, as I hardly see globalism as something that&#x27;s detrimental to America as a whole. That may be the mainstream narrative but it&#x27;s largely inaccurate. The thing about capitalism is that it goes throw booms&#x2F;busts and it evolves. This is just another phase and we&#x27;ve all been pretending we&#x27;re in control but the reality of the situation has become apparent recently.<p>So the dichotomy between historical fluke and market trends doesn&#x27;t really exist.

What would be a 100% reliable way to determine this?<p>And if there is a conflict (because now there <i>can</i> be conflicts. Oh boy!)... How should it be resolved?<p>Again, this is a source of even more complexity. All in the name of the &quot;simple&quot; solution you wanted. Just because a few MBs on disk.<p>Can&#x27;t you see where this is heading? Do you really think this is worth all that extra bullshit?<p>While UEFI is clearly over-engineered in many aspects, what you&#x27;re asking for is under-engineering. And we all know that leads to nasty stuff down the road too."

comment,14267018,,,1493920131,,pents90,"As a long-time Java developer, I really hope they won&#x27;t implement JEP 286. I think type inference by the compiler is a bad idea, as it results in less readable code, more bugs, and an unnecessary burden on the compiler. I think all the examples where type inference is convenient are trivial cases, but the downsides start to crop up in real-world, large code bases. So it&#x27;s something that makes the easy things slightly easier and the hard the things harder.<p>Type inference already happens for you when you are using a good IDE, like IntelliJ IDEA. You can just use the &quot;Introduce Variable&quot; refactoring. And better yet, it self-documents your code with the variable&#x27;s type."

But I think it is an exaggeration to say you can fit all the tool &amp; due makers in the US into one room.  If you live in a major city, try googling how many companies around you advertise their machining operations as Tool &amp; Die.  This is not including all the engineers and artists who have most of the skills required, if not the experience.  That&#x27;s not saying they want to work in your factory, which is another part of the problem.  People who have those skills in the US probably don&#x27;t want the job.  People who want the job don&#x27;t have the skills, partly because the job that would have trained them wasn&#x27;t available."

comment,14266955,,,1493919796,,rebootthesystem,"I am not going to slice and dice numbers because that&#x27;s irrelevant.  The data I&#x27;ve seen indicates the number of afflicted is far greater than the 25% you are alluding to due to Medicaid expansion.<p>Yet, let&#x27;s leave it at that.  Let&#x27;s concede it is only 25% of the folks on Medicaid.  We are at 75 million people enrolled right now and firmly headed towards 100 million if nothing changes.<p>And so, per your number, that means 19 to 25 million people are in debt with the government for their medical care.<p>You keep calling it &quot;fear mongering&quot;.  All I did is provide links to source information where the way the program works is clearly laid out.  And everything is factually correct.<p>Here&#x27;s the part you don&#x27;t seem to want to concede:  If someone is put into Medicaid when they are, say, 40 because they don&#x27;t qualify for subsidies and can&#x27;t afford anything else, they are likely to stay there for a long time.  And I&#x27;d be willing to bet money, they have no clue what&#x27;s coming.<p>So, 15 years later they are still on Medicaid only now they shift over to becoming a debtor to the government for aspects of their medical care.  And it so happens that after 50 to 55 years of age most people start having greater needs.<p>Our population is living far longer now, with 90+ not being uncommon.  Which means that the 100 million or more that will be on Medicaid over the next decade or two will have a greater component of 55 or older folks.  And every single one of them will owe money to the government for health care.<p>This isn&#x27;t fear mongering, this is a mathematical reality.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s fine if the resources for elder care come from the assets of the people receiving the care.<p>Ah. OK.  Now we understand each other.<p>I do not agree with this.  Not at all.  And mostly because most people have no clue they are accumulating debt.<p>If we did NOT call it medical insurance.  If we classified it clearly for what it is.  And if we made certain everyone knew what they were walking into it might be a different matter.<p>I know you are going to say it&#x27;s right there in the forms.  Nobody reads the fucking things.  They want healthcare and they are placed between a rock and a hard place.  They sign on the dotted line and move on.<p>-------------------<p>The fundamental disagreement here is that I am not OK with there being a program that turns people 55 and older into debtors to the government for their medical care.<p>You don&#x27;t have a problem with the idea.<p>That, I think, is the bottom line.  Everything else is slicing and dicing numbers.  This, to me, is a question about the morality of the thing, not about statistics."

Most importantly, protectionism as a mechanism for inflating wages and&#x2F;or spurring job growth <i>in an already developed economy</i> isn&#x27;t nearly as well-tested an approach as examples of protectionism in America&#x27;s past. Historic examples of US protectionism had the end goal of boosting domestic labor productivity. Modern protectionism risks doing exactly the opposite.<p>2. The diffuse benefits of free trade must be weighed against the more localized costs of free trade. It&#x27;s a difficult calculus, but it shouldn&#x27;t be ignored. Cheap stuff at Walmart and Amazon benefits a whole ton of people. Perhaps more importantly, access to foreign markets and capital creates a lot of jobs and wealth domstically. A lot of Americans are employed doing high-paying, high-quality work that is exported globally. (Including a lot of software engineers.)<p>3. The benefits to labor may be short lived if automation wipes out a lot of manufacturing jobs.

Well, is China sending the US $100 in products and not ask for anything in return?  If so, that would obviously be amazing for the US and foolish for China (free stuff!).  The truth is that instead of purchasing $100 in products to send back to China, China instead decides to purchase $100 of investment stuff in the USA, and will take the future returns that investment provides them.  An example: China sends $100 of plane, takes that $100 and builds a $100 apartment building in the USA.

This secret function is your third factor which translates the received SMS code into the value you&#x27;ll input at login.<p>Analysis: Security would increase; but ease-of-use would decrease, especially in regards to how a user would reset their password if they lose both their password and their program that calculates the cryptographic hash."

For instance, I recently upgraded an application written in a rapidly evolving javascript framework to use a different object model for integration and acceptance testing.  There are patterns, but you can&#x27;t just automate it.  Imagine if the rules for english grammar, spelling, and punctuation change every six months, and your job is to go through Ulysses and Finnegans wake, line by line, and update it (some grammar rules will depend on how you changed a different sentence 8 pages ago).  But here&#x27;s the thing, the once you start the upgrade, the entire book is unreadable until you get it all right, and everyone who wants to read it is getting irritated that you&#x27;re taking so long.  If you&#x27;re good at that, yep, you can make 150k or more a year at it.  In fact, there&#x27;s a shortage in this field at some vaguely undefined salary that can&#x27;t be revealed because it&#x27;s secret.<p>If what you do is mathematically interesting, you may be collecting privacy shattering amounts of information about people and using it to figure out better ways to get them to click on advertisements, or how to get them to stay glued to their screens.  Or, you may accept that this is their life, that you&#x27;re not trying to get them addicted to their screens, and that you just want those who already live this way to look at your screen rather than someone else&#x27;s, kind of similar to how tobacco advertising was really about getting people to <i>switch brands</i>, not to start smoking, certainly not before they&#x27;re old enough and haven&#x27;t yet chosen a brand and&#x2F;or are wise enough not to start smoking, certainly not that!<p>That may be grim, and there are good things to do as well.

comment,14266688,,,1493918125,,Bartweiss,"I think you&#x27;re assuming that you can count the jar between pulls. (That was my initial reading also.) In that case, you guess your first number, count the jar, and then work backwards for all subsequent pulls.<p>But on rereading, the info to prove isn&#x27;t &quot;I know how many beans were here to start&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m capable of counting this jar of beans by looking at it&quot;. So if you guess right on the first trial, you still won&#x27;t know the beans-remaining count, and will have to guess on the next trial too.<p>This is made <i>super</i> confusing by the claim that it&#x27;s a ZKP of the initial count. That&#x27;s narrowly true, but the real question at hand is whether you can count the beans."

Are they getting user feedback from people who need it? Could these peoples needs be met with something simpler?

Corruption may be a cherry on top, but eliminating that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that there is simply no way they can export anything at a competitive rate, and that they <i>also</i> can&#x27;t import things they need at reasonable prices either.<p>And becoming a state is in Puerto Rico&#x27;s best interests, but it doesn&#x27;t fix this problem either. Hawaii is suffering as well from the Jones Act - the difference is that Hawaii&#x27;s economy was slightly less dependent on NAFTA-affected trade, and over 20% of Hawaii&#x27;s economy comes from the military and national defense. So Puerto Rico is hit harder, but not for reasons that would be solved by statehood.<p>[0] NAFTA itself would not have been as much of a problem for Puerto Rico if it weren&#x27;t for the Jones Act, so it&#x27;s specifically the combination of both that&#x27;s relevant."

It does not matter if the government can break those locks, until the government itself begins to act like a criminal.  At that point, it becomes necessary to build locks that even a government cannot break.<p>The Snowden alarum showed us all that a portion of the US government has become functionally indistinguishable from an organized crime ring.  So, sorry Comey, but perhaps the FBI should focus for a while on investigating and burning out the criminal corruption within its own umbrella organization before we talk about maybe allowing it the power to intrude upon our personal lives at will, in the name of the greater good.<p>By the house metaphor, law enforcement is more like vampire legends.  The vampire has the strength to batter down any door, but if it crosses the threshold without first being invited inside, it loses its power.  Except the cop-vampire can also be invited in by a magistrate who issues a warrant.<p>And perhaps even that is too lenient.  Maybe our warrants should be issued by a grand jury.  Allowing them to be issued by a sole judge, or panel of judges, seems an invitation to erect secret, rubber-stamp courts like those used for FISA warrants.  Maybe your secret keys should be protected by an M-of-N consensus algorithm using about 30 cryptographically-random peers.  The government then has to convince a bunch of presumably reasonable strangers that it should be allowed access to your keys.  Should be no problem if you&#x27;re a dangerous criminal, but impossible if the state just wants to sniff around in your dirty drawers."

The C919 looks to be almost entirely traditional aluminum construction but the future of transport aircraft is looking to be increasingly based on carbon composites.  The problem is that the industrial processes and supply chains for aluminum vs composite aircraft are <i>extremely</i> dissimilar.

comment,14266361,,,1493916338,,geppeto,"Many cryptocurrencies have found ways to economically incentive &quot;full nodes&quot; without being subject to sybil attacks (one actor pretending to be multiple computers). They do this by requiring the node to have a balance of that currency, and lets them earn as miners (making it prohibitively expensive to sybil). Similar to proof of stake but different.<p>This makes their networks more secure quicker as well as turning nodes into investments in themselves. The amount of that currency you can earn in a year is the yield. This promotes price appreciation on the markets, and for those fearing mass dumps and market corrections it is prudent to realize that node operators all have different time horizons, just like any dividend investor in stocks.<p>This is all complementary to whatever else you would like to use those networks for.<p>With yields being around 8% annually, there is plenty of room for other market participants to discover these networks and accept lower yields.<p>Key words to look for are Supernodes, harvesting, masternodes, staking<p>When any network with those things become valuable and liquid enough then ICOs can happen with those currencies being the funding mechanism for the next leg up.<p>Each of these phenomenons have to be evaluated individually, for their interesting and their most dubious aspects.

comment,14266247,,,1493915664,,SirensOfTitan,"I doubt it.  If you want to blame geopolitical factors at all for the recent investment in cryptocurrency:<p>1. Chinese investors see crypto as a way of moving currency outside of China.  The Chinese government has recently cracked down on movement of money outside of the country.<p>2. The rise of populism could drive people into crypto.  The rise of actors like Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders (although defeated) implies major currency instability, especially around USD, EUR.<p>On (2), from what I understand Gold has become less of a good hedge against world economic stability as well."

From a long term perspective, its absolutely amazing that the US has managed to export all the factory level jobs to other countries and yet managed to keep the better paying jobs back here in the states. The current lack of (low skilled) jobs in manufacturing has made it clear to those Americans willing to listen: they (or their children) need to acquire those skills that make them employable in the 21st century, and those do not include low-skilled factory jobs. The next generation will be better prepared and I predict the US will continue as a global technological powerhouse (unless it gets fucked by Trumpism and populism of course)."

That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s an old people brand, it&#x27;s for people who can&#x27;t eat enough solid food to maintain their weight. Just compare the nutritional labels:<p>Soylent (400 kcal)

37g carbs (9g simple sugars, 3g fibers)
20g protein<p>Ensure (400 kcal)
11g fat
60g carb (?g simple sugars, doesn&#x27;t say, NO FIBERS)
16g protein<p>I looked at every single brand of meal replacement shakes I could get my hands on around here at drugstores, I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Soylent and figured one of them would do. You would think <i>someone</i> would be making a meal replacement that&#x27;s not sugar water garbage already. NOPE. Plus, most of them serve a different goal, either weight gain or weight loss, not just meal replacement.<p>EDIT: arguably Soylent is sugar water garbage too, it&#x27;s first ingredients are water and maltodextrin (a sugar), but it&#x27;s not as bad as the others I&#x27;ve looked at."

At all. You can prep an entire week worth of meals in 1 hour. Refrigerate them, freeze them.<p>If I don&#x27;t know how to cook, then I have to spend a decent amount of time learning.

That&#x27;s immoral and wrong.<p>As for the philosophical question of the wealthy passing assets to their children, that&#x27;s an entirely different discussion.  As an advanced and &quot;civilized&quot; nation we should not use the healthcare system as a battering ram to deal with such issues.  Healthcare should be about just that, healthcare.  Everyone should have access to it and it should not bankrupt anyone or turn them into debtors to the government.  We need to achieve that.  The issue of inheritance, etc. is a matter for a different kind of legislation and it should be kept separate from medical care.  I hope you&#x27;ll agree to that as well.<p>-----------------<p>I&#x27;m pretty sick of what politicians have been doing with our healthcare system over the past 20 to 50 years. It is an absolute mess.  And I fear it will get worst before it gets better.<p>What we need is leadership that is able to have an adult conversation with the nation to explain how we need to work together for the greater good.  Instead we have politicians in various political camps playing fucking games with our healthcare for political gain, not our benefit.<p>The right kind of leader would be able to unite the citizenry in understanding that the ONLY way we are going to end-up with a better system is if we accept that we all have the obligation to contribute --obviously based on financial ability-- in order to create a system where anyone, rich or poor, can walk into a hospital and not worry one iota about costs.  What we have today is a horrible mess.  And Trump, despite what many might think, is very far from the leader we need on this matter.  I think we can agree on this as well."

comment,14266028,,,1493914568,,TheOtherHobbes,"The initial cost of production is far from zero, as anyone who has spent more than few months (years) building a non-trivial application will tell you.<p>As you say, updates&#x2F;fixes also cost. So do marketing, web infrastructure and so on.<p>It&#x27;s usual in business to charge for utility and perceived value (&quot;As much as the market can bear&quot;), not for the cost of mechanical assembly&#x2F;reproduction.<p>OP is correct that Apple has created a new(ish) distribution model. It was a gold-rush for a year or three, but has become extremely unfavourable to new product development.<p>But this has become a curation and discovery problem, not a distribution problem. Apple&#x27;s 30% would be a lot more palatable if discovery and search worked better, if buyers could opt-in to a mailing list to support newsletters, cross-sales, and future sales, if sellers could set up trials - and so on.<p>None of this is likely because the App Store is an example of the first law of aggregation - be the feudal landowner, not the peasant smallholder.<p>The App Store is immensely profitable for Apple. The law of aggregation means that Apple has no serious incentive to make it better.<p>The App Store won&#x27;t change now. Eventually the entire platform will collapse and be replaced by a new technology in a new market space. But I wouldn&#x27;t bet on that happening within five years, and possibly not within ten.

comment,14265914,,,1493913895,,luhn,"&gt; ...people seeing eating as a nuisance that should be optimized away versus something that should be savoured and enjoyed.
&gt; In one world, Soylent could eventually dominate, in the other, it will remain a niche product because eating and food is too important too most, also culturally speaking.<p>This is a false dichotomy.  I savor and enjoy food, but not <i>all</i> the food I eat.  If every frozen burrito was replaced with Soylent, Soylent would be far more than a niche product, yet society would not have lost it&#x27;s appreciation for the cultural, social, and culinary aspects of food."

comment,14265908,,,1493913872,,rockostrich,"Any meal you can cook without the Joule using other cooking methods.  8 oz of chicken breast (~$1.50), 6 oz of brussel sprouts (~$0.75), 8 oz of potatoes (~$0.25).  That&#x27;s a $2.50 meal.  Add half an onion, some bell pepper, some spices, and oil for cooking and it probably comes out to less than $3.<p>Of course, those are average food prices in the US so YMMV.  If you&#x27;re in NYC or LA&#x2F;SF, it&#x27;s going to cost more than that no matter where you shop."

comment,14265902,,,1493913845,,johnfn,Very interesting comment. Definitely food for thought.<p>One thing to keep in mind is it&#x27;s not only depresssion that could cause the poor time management that Soylent benefits from. The whole &quot;gotta be working every minute of every day&quot; ethos of SV can feed into this very easily as well. Which isn&#x27;t also to say that the two can&#x27;t be intertwined...

comment,14265896,,,1493913804,,runeks,"&gt; I think largely because transactions can be ultra fast, ultra cheap, and can execute auditable, but arbitrary custom logic.<p>Blockchains are neither fast nor cheap; their value is trustlessness, not performance. The SWIFT network handled 15 million transfers per day in 2015 [1], Bitcoin&#x27;s current maximum is around 600k per day&#x2F;~7 transactions per second. That being said, the Bitcoin-limit is self-imposed (1MB per block), but even so the security of the network weakens as storage requirements for nodes increase, so <i>some</i> limit is required, in my opinion.<p>The value of crypto currencies is in the decentralized&#x2F;trustless medium of exchange. I think, in the end, we will use various clearing protocols on top of Bitcoin, in order to circumvent the slow on-Blockchain settlement (just like VISA handles consumer-to-merchant transactions instead of SWIFT). It&#x27;s very much like gold: perfect as a store of value, but relatively cumbersome to transfer from person to person.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Society_for_Worldwide_Interban...</a>"

The annals of history ( as in the last ~100 years :P ) are littered with field attempts at finding &quot;consciousness&quot; and mixing neuroscience with philosophy with the occasional mathematician and once in a blue moon a CS...<p>My skepticism comes less from a hatred of &quot;Strong AI&quot; and more from the fact that it has been promised over and over again with no results to show for it. In addition, every time &quot;weak AI&quot; makes progress, there&#x27;s always someone who writes an article bashing the progress of &quot;weak AI&quot; and saying &quot;it isn&#x27;t <i>REAL AI</i> (tm)&quot;.<p>This is kind of similar to the reason I dislike neuromorphic architectures, you can&#x27;t just assume that you&#x27;re right and look down upon all others, you need to show results if you want to do that."

I suffer from depression and ADHD, so while I generally collect myself enough to make a proper evening meal, prior to Huel I would often skip or forget meals, and binge on junk later in the day. I&#x27;m working on 50&#x2F;50.<p>From the horses mouth, most use cases I&#x27;ve heard are pretty sensible. Very few users treat it as their entire diet.

comment,14265863,,,1493913631,,afinlayson,"I had my own App Company back in 2009, before I went corporate and joined Apple to work on iOS.<p>I saw the problem as this: once a person has created a valuable software package, usually it costs nothing to rip it off.<p>Example:
If I create the best kick ass calculator, with 10x better UX, better functionality. And charge $10. The learning has been done and the barrier to reproduce what I&#x27;ve created is almost 0.
So someone does that, and remakes it, adds a photo sharing feature and charges $5.
Then a student comes along and thinks &quot;that&#x27;s cleaver, but what if I add farting noises&quot; and because He gets education out of it, make&#x27;s it completely free. How does the first guy recoup his R&amp;D cost? He can&#x27;t really. It&#x27;s too easy to reproduce.<p>I know this is a little simplistic, because there&#x27;s the marketing effort and SEO.

comment,14265854,,,1493913583,,ChemicalWarfare,"&gt;&gt; HN seems to venerate startups that fail, which isn&#x27;t very different from defaulting on a loan (and in many cases these startups are defaulting on loans as they shut down).<p>I don&#x27;t subscribe to the notion that &quot;bankruptcy is immoral&quot;, it&#x27;s just a business transaction within the established framework with checks and balances in place.<p>That said though - situation with startups and business development loans in general is a little different because startups are by definition attempting to turn the idea they present to investors into reality with investors&#x27; money. So unless they fail because of a blatant mismanagement of funds (which does happen of course) - in a typical startup failure situation where something is built but there&#x27;s no more runway and no more money coming in and no buyers to take over the operation - this just feels like it&#x27;s easier to justify the less negative vibe around that situation."

comment,14265833,,,1493913481,,acemarke,"I think you&#x27;re very wrong on a couple levels.<p>First, React has spread the concept of composable component-based UI development.  Angular has adopted many of the ideas, Ember has adopted many of the ideas, and there&#x27;s a whole bunch of other libraries that have been inspired by ideas that React has helped popularize.<p>Second, React&#x27;s popularity is continuing to grow.  I&#x27;m pretty biased, but I don&#x27;t see React as a &quot;fad&quot;, and I definitely don&#x27;t see it going away any time soon.<p>Third, the point of React itself is to _reduce_ complexity so that you can look at components in isolation and understand how they behave.  Yes, yes, &quot;Javascript Fatigue&quot;, tooling, libraries, etc, etc.  Most of that is not React-specific, but rather a factor of trying to build complex web applications that live in a browser.<p>If you have any specific concerns or complaints about learning or using React, I&#x27;d be happy to answer questions.  Just for kicks, I&#x27;ll toss out my standard advice for learning React:<p>The article &quot;A Study Plan to Cure Javascript Fatigue&quot; ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.freecodecamp.com&#x2F;a-study-plan-to-cure-javascript-fatigue-8ad3a54f2eb1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.freecodecamp.com&#x2F;a-study-plan-to-cure-javascr...</a> ) is a great place to start. It gives an excellent series of steps for tackling modern Javascript concepts one piece at a time: Javascript, React, ES6, and state management.<p>On that note, definitely don&#x27;t over-complicate the learning process by trying to learn many different things at once. Some people will say you should use a &quot;boilerplate&quot; to learn React, and they&#x27;re wrong - boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured, and are confusing for beginners.<p>Instead, the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first. Once you have a good understanding of how React works, you will better appreciate why a state management library like Redux can be useful, and you can learn about other tools later.<p>You should start out by reading through the official React docs and tutorial at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;</a>, and I&#x27;d encourage you to use the official Create-React-App tool ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookincubator&#x2F;create-react-app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookincubator&#x2F;create-react-app</a> ) for setting up projects. It creates a project with a solid build setup, with no configuration needed on your part. There&#x27;s an excellent post called &quot;Simple React Development in 2017&quot; ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;simple-react-development-in-2017-113bd563691f"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;simple-react-development-in-2017-113b...</a> ) that gives some more specific instructions on the actual steps to follow.<p>Past that, I keep a big list of links to high-quality tutorials and articles on React, Redux, and related topics, at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links</a> . Specifically intended to be a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the ecosystem, as well as a solid source of good info on more advanced topics. It includes links for learning core Javascript (ES5), modern Javascript (ES6+), React, and much more. I also published an &quot;Intro to React (and Redux)&quot; presentation at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;presentation-react-redux-intro&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;presentation-react-...</a> , which is a good overview of the basic concepts for both React and Redux.<p>Finally, the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord are a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn. The invite link is at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reactiflux.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reactiflux.com</a> ."

comment,14265737,,,1493912897,,csa,"A few comments:<p>- To answer your question directly, if the numbers in the article are accurate, black women were disproportionately more funded per black female founder. The overall numbers are very low (i.e., relatively few black female founders overall), so I personally wouldn&#x27;t draw any conclusions from this data since it is too easy to skew.<p>- Getting funding in general is hard. If a black female founder doesn&#x27;t get funding, it probably has more to do with their idea or team than with anything else. Said another way, the same idea with founders of different race&#x2F;sex will only very rarely change the outcome.<p>- Is it with the effort to pursue VC funding period (irrespective of being a black female)? Most ideas that people have simply don&#x27;t scale to levels that will be interesting to VCs. Additionally, even if the idea has the potential to scale, it has to scale in the right way (i.e., on a VC timeline).<p>- I&#x27;m curious about why you believe anything in TC or Wired. They are in the business of selling clicks, and most businesses like this are quick and dirty with numbers and&#x2F;or conclusions. I would weight these about zero in my decision about whether to pursue VC funding or not.<p>- Social capital goes a long way in VC funding. While there are certainly some people who will exclude because of a founder&#x27;s blackness or womanness, there are many others who won&#x27;t. I suggest getting close to some VC-funded founders somehow (social hack this). Private conversations with these folks will get you much more valuable and actionable information than a TC article or a post on HN.<p>- HN&#x27;s (and Stripe&#x27;s) own patio11 makes a point of being willing to meet young entrepreneurs to talk about these types of matters. This guy has well-informed opinions. Even if you disagree with some of his conclusions, you will at least have some great information to act on. Searching for patio11 and kalzumeus will point to a way to reach him.<p>- I suggest reading all of Paul Graham&#x27;s essays. Short summary for founders: talk to your customers and iterate your product.<p>- I also suggest you read Michael O&#x27;Church&#x27;s essays about VC culture on the way back machine. Sometimes they come off as being a bit shrill, but those essays provide a lot of valuable (and imho often accurate) insights about the dysfunction of certain parts of VC culture.<p>I hope this helps."

In the grand scheme of things, we have just started being able to really monitor and improve all aspects of our lives (in terms of time spent, convenience), and there is the question of how far we (most people&#x2F;potential customers) ultimately want to go. It has become clear that there is the potential to optimise away friction&#x2F;time spent in almost all human habits, but it is not yet clear if we really want to keep going down that route.<p>Will we keep optimizing things like meals just because we can until there are (conceivably) nutrient implants that make eating unnecessary, or will we sort of revert and see that maximising utility of every interaction does not lead to overall greater satisfaction?<p>In one world, Soylent could eventually dominate, in the other, it will remain a niche product because eating and food is too important too most, also culturally speaking."

Telling them they can&#x27;t is not freedom.<p>You emphasized <i>anyone</i> but by allowing developers to take the code proprietary, their users (which are using your code) are being denied the freedom you promote. This is of course the distinction between GPL and BSD-type licenses. One gives developers all the freedom they want while the other ensures that <i>all</i> users (including those using derivative works) are given those freedoms.<p>&gt;&gt; I feel we&#x27;ve lost ourselves in the freedom of users and forgotten about the people that make the applications for the users.<p>No, we have not. One form of license ensures all users have the right to do whatever they want with the code. The other form (which some call permissive) grants the right to deny others those freedoms. I understand both stances, but I believe calling the right to deny others rights &quot;permissive&quot; is rather misleading."

Before my daughter was born, I was able to work from almost anywhere: noisy cafes, at home, the library, etc. But after she was born it was like my brain needed a space away from home where I could close a door and have a room all to myself, a place where I couldn&#x27;t hear family sounds or be within walking distance of anyone I knew. I tried cafes and libraries but, oddly, they no longer worked for me—the noise and the people walking by suddenly became a huge distraction. I couldn&#x27;t focus.

&gt; I&#x27;m in that situation now (with a SaaS product), and my approach so far has been:
&gt; * set up tests
&gt; * set up Docker images
&gt; * set up docker-compose for easy local deployments<p>In my personal opinion, this is all good work to do. One minor nit: You probably want to get out of the habit of thinking about `docker-compose up` as a <i>deployment</i>, and just think of it as a much cleaner, much more &quot;prod-like&quot; local development environment.<p>&gt; * do lots of work to make the app behave inside Docker<p>I&#x27;m curious about this. What was the overall nature of the work? Things you would have had to figure out in a distributed platform anyway, or container-specific issues?<p>&gt; * take control of AWS and IAM using CloudFormation, making it easy to set up and roll back permissions<p>This is amazing, I applaud you for your foresight. I wish we had known about this pattern much earlier.<p>&gt; * bootstrap KOPS&#x2F;K8s with CloudFormation<p>This is where there&#x27;s going to be another giant time sink, unless you&#x27;re already pretty familiar with Kubernetes&#x27; resources—Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims, Secrets, etc—how they work together, what they enable, what their limitations are, and so on. Not to mention picking a network overlay plugin, deciding on a service discovery model, and understanding <i>how</i> Kubernetes works. BTW I am currently working on this very knowledge, and at least for me it&#x27;s been pretty heady stuff at times.<p>&gt;Future work:
&gt;* set up Jenkins CI on top of K8s
&gt;* K8s deployments of the app for CI

&gt;* K8s in production<p>Everything here seems relatively sane, in broad terms. I mainly caution against moving too quickly and also against spending engineering efforts on this if you are also an IC for the applications your teams are writing.<p>&gt;This has been my first venture in operations and it&#x27;s been very interesting and rewarding, but at times it gets very intimidating to &quot;be&quot; operations with no senior guidance.<p>Honestly, you seem to have the right mindset for this and so far you haven&#x27;t mentioned anything that I see as a huge red flag.<p>&gt;I enjoy the freedom and responsibility and I feel like I at least have a significantly better grasp on this than anyone else in the company, but I wish I knew of a way to feel like my work was good in an absolute sense, like &quot;definitely good enough&quot;.<p>Welcome to ops! There will never not be an operational issue that either needs to be fixed or is silently waiting to strike at 3AM on Monday morning."

In the U.S. every city has done that with bus services.  But if you look around the world you&#x27;ll find places like Buenos Aires that have not done this and have a thriving bus industry that can get you from very close to point A to very close to point B in much less time than buses in the U.S. and with fewer transfers.<p>But now consider something like Uber&#x2F;Lyft for _small_ buses: routes need not be set in stone.  You pre-arrange every day where and when to get picked up and dropped off.  This can probably get much closer to the travel times that private cars can deliver.<p>Bikes are not the answer, incidentally.  Only a small proportion of the population in the U.S. will use them, and only a small proportion of the population in American cities lives 0-5mi from work.  We don&#x27;t build high pop. density cities in the U.S. anymore.  The re-zoning plans in Austin (to give one example) call for adding in the next decade just one third of the housing Austin needs, thus increasing sprawl -- this happens because of NIMBYism, and the story is the same just about everywhere that isn&#x27;t already a high pop. density city.

comment,14265098,,,1493908499,,dspillett,"Makers of new libraries are free to chose how far they go with testing and support in different browsers. Of course you might be forced, by you client base (or intended client base) to support other browsers and if so you have three choices: don&#x27;t use libraries that don&#x27;t support the browsers you need to work with, test yourself and maintain your own branch if changes are needed for those browsers, or try nag people to share your pain and support what you need them to support.<p>Option three is likely to fall on deaf ears as the decision of how much time is worth spending on compatibility testing has already been made, so unless you can give a really compelling reason the won&#x27;t want to. Option two is only viable if you (or your team more generally) have both relevant experience and time, which is often not the case. So this library may not be for you...<p>Not supporting at least IE11 is rare currently in my experience but I suspect it is a condition that will steadily grow more widespread. You may find that everything in the library works well enough in IE11 and the developers try to not intentionally do something that would change this, but don&#x27;t feel they have the time to test (and fix as needed) sufficiently be able to make such guarantees.<p>Of course existing libraries that support IE11 are generally expected to keep doing so at very least least up to the next major release."

comment,14265017,,,1493907805,,drdaeman,"It&#x27;s still broken.<p>First, there is no sane way to grant permissions &quot;just for a few minutes&quot; rather than forever (unless revoked). E.g. a banking app that has a screen with nearest ATM locations doesn&#x27;t need GPS access granted all the time - only when I ask for the directions.<p>Then, there are apps that ask for just about everything (a long sequence of &quot;grant AppName access to something&quot;) at startup. It&#x27;s a subjective opinion but I believe this sort of &quot;fix&quot; to deal with the new permission model on SDK update was quite popular, as I saw it relatively a lot.<p>And it&#x27;s good if denying access is an option and you just aren&#x27;t asked the same thing again until you either give up or kill the app. It&#x27;s probably not an issue if that&#x27;s some flashlight app you can uninstall without even thinking about it, but isn&#x27;t so much when it&#x27;s an app from your mobile network, allowing you to manage your plan, or something unique enough to be considered valuable.<p>I see only two options how to fix this for real. First is more and more regulations. Second is improved app isolation and permission spoofing (silent mic input, empty contact list and filesystem, no persistent identifiers across reinstalls, etc), and activity indicators &quot;app is trying to access the camera right now&quot;, &quot;app had accessed your contact list recently&quot; that would both raise alarm or allow to grant access, depending on the end-user decision."

The only rational reason is to drive your competitors out of business.<p>This statement is far too rigid.  You probably don&#x27;t mean it exactly as written.  To illustrate, this would imply that Robinhood was not attempting to fairly compete in the brokerage market when it first launched."

comment,14264858,,,1493906403,,geofft,"I&#x27;d think that it would be fairly easy to measure, honestly: do a longitudinal study of new hires at several top companies, and come back 5 years later and see who&#x27;s still in the industry and what their level of promotion is if so. You know both their educational history, their demographics, and their standardized test scores (a close-enough proxy for <i>g</i>), and you can see how well they predict success.<p>There will be biases (in the scientific sense) in the data because of how the interview process selects for successful candidates, which is going to be correlated with these three and probably many other things. But I think the study would still be sound.<p>(Also, it occurs to me that I&#x27;ve been making about one assumption that is likely to be untrue: that people who do better at top software engineering companies are actually better software engineers. It is entirely possible that software engineering companies are systematically failing to hire and promote the best software engineers, because their interview and review processes are broken. In fact, that is what the pervasive-sexism-in-tech hypothesis implies: that individuals are <i>so</i> sexist that they would prefer to hire a man over a more qualified women, possibly because they&#x27;re subconsciously failing to realize that the man is actually less qualified. If we want to test this hypothesis seriously, we need to separate &quot;actually a good dev&quot; and &quot;recognized as a good dev&quot;. I could easily believe that being in the top percentile of <i>g</i> is correlated with hiring and promotion, because it&#x27;s easy to measure, but less tightly correlated with actually being good at your job.)"

Second, if you are really concerned, you can just remove a lot of components from bootstrap to reduce its size. I do it for my project where i don&#x27;t need for example the glyphicon, carousel, etc.<p>When using a framework, you want it to just work on all platforms.

Trading on insider information is literally stealing from those who don&#x27;t have it. Imagine the CEO of a company knowing he&#x27;s about to announce bad news and shorting his own stock ahead of the announcement to make millions from it, then buying it all up cheap at the bottom before announcing some large new government contract causing the price to rebound and making more millions again... all that money he&#x27;s making, he&#x27;s stealing from the general public by knowing what&#x27;s going to happen ahead of time and using it to have an unfair advantage.

comment,14264627,,,1493904554,,lispm,"&gt; why German companies aren&#x27;t moving their production to cheaper markets<p>German companies ARE moving their production to cheaper markets. They have been doing this for decades and they are doing it today. At the same time the market has expanded and changed. Thus new jobs are created, even a few are coming back. If we talk about manufacturing, which was the original topic, you can see multiple trends (examples in parentheses): exports of jobs (ship yards), back-import of jobs (automated manufacturing), disappearing jobs (nuclear industry), creation of new jobs (renewable energy), ...<p>&gt; economic powerhouses<p>East Germany is our own &#x27;economic powerhouse&#x27;. Twenty million people with a much different job market, compared to West Germany.<p>&gt; You obviously didn&#x27;t read the articles I&#x27;ve posted.<p>None of that is new. If you read German mainstream media, that stuff has been discussed for a long time. FAZ, Handelsblatt, etc. have published a lot of these arguments. It&#x27;s just that for each economist arguing that way, we can find another one, which argues against it. The media published this discussion. You just have to read it.<p>&gt; abolishing the laws of mathematics<p>That&#x27;s a very simplified argument, with a very limited view what actually happens.<p>&gt; But would it be such a &quot;success&quot; without major influence in EU institutions, in ECB, without Euro, with other countries having their currencies (which they can devalue to make their good cheaper and imported - German - goods more expensive), with customs on its goods, with fairer wages in Germany? I highly doubt it.<p>Germany has influence not because the ECB or the Euro. It has influence because it is the largest european country, it sits in the middle of europe. ECB policy has NOT following German demands. The Euro was not a German invention. But that European monetary systems have been influenced by Germany because of its economic power has always been true.<p>If you look back, Germany has export oriented with large surplus for decades. Without the Euro, with the European Monetary System, with the Euro.<p>The german economy will simply adapt to the changing conditions: weak currency, hard currency. The industry will react, but it will always be export oriented. Generally the economists prefer a harder currency, which actually will not have a specially negative effect on the export industry. With the super-hard Deutsche Mark, the export industry was doing just fine."

comment,14264426,,,1493902525,,Mtinie,"<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; It would be cool to do it in such a way that you ship the crypto &quot;fund&quot; as a binary that users run on their own server, kind of like a smart wallet. The program would make automatic trades to rebalance some BTC you initially deposit. You could &quot;withdraw&quot; BTC with a sale (implementation detail) whenever you wanted.
</code></pre>
I like the concept, a lot. In fact, I like it so much so that I&#x27;m going to toss out a bunch of unsolicited advice for you -- or whoever starts down the path to build a tool like this -- to consider.<p>My immediate concern would be ensuring the fund was large enough to support the counter party risk that everyone would take on as their tokens cycled between BTC and whatever else was in the index. If it&#x27;s not large enough and you have a significant enough event that triggers a higher-than-normal BTC pull out you may end up in a situation where some number of the users are stuck with tokens that they can&#x27;t do anything with.<p>The second concern I have is how you&#x27;d manage to avoid a situation of a eventual &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;, wrt all of the token-specific fees that are automatically deducted for each transaction. Every trade the tool makes -- if conducted on-blockchain versus through a centralized service&#x2F;layer -- will gradually erode the user&#x27;s capital.<p>If you tried to aggregate the trades off-blockchain to avoid the individual transaction fees for every trade you introduce a whole new set of risks and challenges.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re doing everything on-blockchain, you need to consider that the &quot;settlement time&quot; for each transaction won&#x27;t be consistent. The different tokens will take different amounts of time, and even within the same token there&#x27;s going to be wild variability. For example, within the last two months I&#x27;ve had different BTC transactions take anywhere from 1 hour to 2 days to reach six network confirmations. I always include a (nominally) higher than the minimum required transaction fee to ensure I&#x27;m not actively dropped by miners, and it&#x27;s as much a function of luck as it is lots of other variables that would be outside of your direct control. You could pay a larger fee per transaction in the hopes of getting the miners to prioritize your trades, but that leads you back to my early point about &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;.<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t think there would be legal requirements there.
</code></pre>
For you, the developer, maybe not if you give it away.<p>For the person running the software there are almost certainly going to be tax implications at a bare minimum (and all sorts of other local regulatory and legal &quot;land mines&quot;) that they would need to consider.<p>If you&#x27;d like to charge money for the binary in the form of a perpetual license fee, you may be ok. I expect that you would eventually run in to regulatory issues if you set it up to charge a trading fee or subscription fee (ostensibly for &quot;financial services&quot; such as assisting with the matching of traders). It all depends on how quickly your tool reached a point where it was successful enough to draw the attention of some regulator, somewhere.<p>---<p>IANAL &#x2F; IANAA, but I spent a number of years working full-time in the cryptocurrency space, so I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of great ideas up-ended by even the perceived threat of legal action.<p>I enjoy discussing these topics, so if you or anyone else would like to chat about it off HN, my contact info is in my profile."

The problem is that any one of them might collide with some tiny piece of junk, turning it 1000 pieces of junk (which is now 1000x more likely to collide with something, and impossible to control). These satellites won&#x27;t tip the scales, but it&#x27;s a nightmare scenario that comes ever closer with every satellite launched."

comment,14263781,,,1493892816,,ajha239,"I&#x27;m an accountant and do not think this is the end or even a bad thing necessarily. I know PR is attached to the US Dollar but any dollar has to originate and then be entered into the economy, which is usually done by crediting&#x2F;lending institutions.<p>If you look at the entirety of the economy, bankruptcy is inevitable to some level or money has to be made somewhere. There is simply too much cash flow at any given time to say what countries owe what to who because if every country was debt free then there would be absolutely no currency.<p>Even Trump has filed bankruptcy FOUR times, including defaulting entirely on a multi-billion dollar loan but he gained value through the process. I&#x27;m not saying anyone should accept defaulting on any payments but the effects of looking at an entire economy are not necessary the same. The first time PR asked for money, the value of the dollar in PR was then multipled on top of itself every time additional currency was acquired from the US. If PR was going to completely get out of debt, then it would need a large amount to be shot straight into the economy, just like this.<p>There is so much more to it and nobody knows what will happen, just like we don&#x27;t know what the stock market will do at a sound of a bell.<p>Best of luck thou"

comment,14263700,,,1493891515,,ue_,"&gt;See how far you&#x27;re going to get with your startup by offering to pay software engineers &quot;enough to sustain them&quot;.<p>This is not a refutation. Just like the raw materials used for production, the means of production, land rent etc. what is purchased is a commodity. Labour-time is that commodity. It makes good business sense to not only buy commodities at their value (and no more) but even to try and buy commodities under their value.<p>Why do you think labour-power is any different? It must be paid in accordance with its value, and how much extra is minimally required to ensure the continuance of the production of this commodity.<p>&gt;The owner of labour-power is mortal. If then his appearance in the market is to be continuous, and the continuous conversion of money into capital assumes this, the seller of labour-power must perpetuate himself, &quot;in the way that every living individual perpetuates himself, by procreation.&quot; The labour-power withdrawn from the market by wear and tear and death, must be continually replaced by, at the very least, an equal amount of fresh labour-power. Hence the sum of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labour-power must include the means necessary for the labourer&#x27;s substitutes, i.e., his children, in order that this race of peculiar commodity-owners may perpetuate its appearance in the market.<p>&gt;Included in the value of labour power is both a physical component (the minimum physical requirements for a healthy worker) and a moral-historical component (the satisfaction of needs beyond the physical minimum which have become an established part of the lifestyle of the average worker). The value of labour power is thus a historical norm, which is the outcome of a combination of factors: productivity; the supply and demand for labour; the assertion of human needs; the costs of acquiring skills; state laws stipulating minimum or maximum wages, the balance of power between social classes, etc.<p>If the capitalist paid for labour-power at more than its value consistently, in the long run the capitalist will tend to make no profit at all. Profit originates in surplus value being extracted, and although there is leeway (there is a rate of surplus value, for example 0.6, though it could be 0.3 and the capitalist would still make a profit) any sensible capitalist will aim for the largest extraction possible."

comment,14263685,,,1493891104,,developer2,"The way people are treating cryptocurrency exchanges makes absolutely no sense to me. Most people are buying into it because they are absolutely certain they will manage to cash out once the currency hits an extreme &quot;all time high&quot;. When such a peak occurs whereby the top 1% - as determined by number of coins owned - cashes out, everyone else who jumped on the bandwagon thinking they would also cash out is going to be left with exactly nothing.<p>Let&#x27;s be absolutely clear: your coins are only worth what someone is willing to pay. And when the one and only true &quot;run on the bank&quot; of one of these currencies happens, it will happen within the span of less than an hour. All these people who are buying to eventually cash out are going to blink and wonder what the hell happened.<p>Take BTC as the example right now. All over the place, people are showing regret for not buying in a few years ago. No average BTC &quot;shareholder&quot; is going to be able to cash out for more than mere pennies. The majority of coins are owned by big players, and you are effectively dumping your cash into their pockets by buying into it.<p>BTC&#x27;s Nakamoto &quot;promises&quot; they will never cash out their enormous share. How nice of them. The community can monitor Nakamoto&#x27;s wallets all they want. I can&#x27;t wait for him&#x2F;her to cash out their BTC, and screw over the entire system. I&#x27;m just sitting here ready to laugh."

After all, political speech is free speech.<p>Then people either self-radicalise (go on a murder spree without coordinating action with a larger group; e.g. many mass shooters), or they meet up in person. Lots of radicalised people go to the Middle East where they can&#x27;t be surveilled by western security forces.<p>There&#x27;s remarkably little evidence that terrorists are making routine use of strong encryption."

I have seen great works of art made using Microsoft Paint.<p>&gt; Ubuntu is pretty solid but I would be a liar if I wouldn&#x27;t admit it has serious flaws (e.g. making the user execute superuser shell commands to test and enable hibernation is pretty shitty UX).

But, there are plenty of things that can only be done using a terminal in macOS, as well. In fact, macOS&#x2F;Apple is pretty much known for hiding things from their GUIs.<p>Anyway, I do not agree that typing in commands are bad UX. Many things are far easier and faster to do in a terminal than through a GUI. One example: installing software.<p>&gt; I started off the year by giving a couple of alternative browsers a chance to wean me off my reliance on Google Chrome and even Brave was a more workable solution than Firefox: in order to make Firefox work properly I had to learn about its multiprocessing mode and individually test extensions from the official addon hub for compatibility. And while the dev tools certainly feel like a lot of effort went into them they come nowhere near the UX of Chrome&#x27;s.<p>Why are you talking about browsers and comparing Firefox to Chrome, are you trying to compare open source vs closed-source?

My guess is that both fees are regulated.<p>Your guess is correct, and it&#x27;s the basic equivalent of net neutrality. In essence, European energy markets moved to net neutrality when they were liberated. Before, the local utility &quot;owned&quot; the customer, and in turn got to decide where to buy (and&#x2F;or produce themselves) the energy they sold to the customer. Their monopoly power was restrained by being publicly owned, or by being required to keep prices close to those charged by publicly-owned utilities.<p>Energy is slightly different in that it is almost a true commodity, so people rarely cared (&quot;almost&quot;, because some consumers have since chosen to pay more for renewables)"

comment,14263547,,,1493888702,,IsmaOlvey,"No. They&#x27;re using the same gameplay code as the original Starcraft:<p><pre><code>    Q: How did you go about replicating all the unexpected “bugs” that made BW micro
    so special? Did you simply reuse code from the original game, or did you find a
    solution to replicate the nuances of BW’s gameplay?

    A: StarCraft: Remastered is able to achieve this effect as it uses all the same
    gameplay code as Brood War. This means that Dragoons and Goliaths are still a
    bit derpy in how they react to movement commands. The Reaver’s shot doesn’t
    always find a target. Mutas stack.

    The fact is that the gameplay is identical enough that old replays from 1.16
    will play and work just fine under StarCraft: Remastered.

I still open &gt; &gt; Photoshop&#x2F;Lightroom on my Windows laptop when I need them (although lately I&#x27;ve been trying to use DarkTable and RawTherapee for some projects) but yes, Gimp is far from being a high end tool. Illustrator still kills Inkscape (I worked with a hardcore OSS guy who said it&#x27;s just a matter of training, what you&#x27;re use to and what you start with. I could tell he&#x27;d never done any real graphical editing work ever).<p>Could you expound on what DarkTable, GIMP, and Inkscape needs to be more comparable to the Windows&#x2F;Mac alternatives? What are the crucial, missing features?<p>As a hobbyist photographer and video editor, who has used Lightroom and Photoshop extensively, I find that I manage fine with alternatives available on Linux.<p>&gt; But who is working on it? Obviously not you. Obviously not me. It&#x27;s a lot of work. I&#x27;ve looked at code here and there and often said &quot;..huh..that&#x27;s not has bad as I..oh no wait..yea..yea it is..I wish I had the time to work on this.&quot;<p>I am working on it. A lot of us are. But we need to know what to implement. We need bug reports and feature requests. DarkTable alone has almost 20 000 commits and 200 contributors. The Linux kernel has about a 1000 contributors for every release.<p>Does it look like we&#x27;re not working on it?<p>And money? ... Well, yes, most HN commenters seem to be very money-centered. After all, it&#x27;s a site about starting new crappy companies, pushing shitty, useless products noone needs. They don&#x27;t give a shit what they partake in, as long as the paycheck is right.<p>But, nevermind that.<p>A lot of open source contributors are paid full time to do this. So you can work on open source 24&#x2F;7 and get a fat paycheck, if that&#x27;s your thing. The two are not mutually exclusive.<p>Then there are those who actually code because they like it, you know. Because it&#x27;s their passion. They might endure a shitty job to make a living, but in a weekend they do 50 commits to open source projects.<p>Be a slave if you want, I choose not to. I work on whatever I want."

comment,14263478,,,1493887533,,stephen_g,"Really, the Federal Government <i>must</i> deficit spend for the private sector to be able to save in the presence of a current account deficit. It&#x27;s actually just accounting, derived from the definition of GDP itself (it&#x27;s called the <i>Sectoral balances equation</i>, see Godley &amp; Lavoie 2012 but also around the Internet).<p>If the Government doesn&#x27;t deficit spend (or run large enough deficits), the only way the private sector can grow (as a whole) is by taking on more debt - which was the case before the GFC. But as soon as the lending slowed and stopped as the private sector stopped being able to take on more debt, a huge source of demand disappeared and the economy tanked. This actually very neatly explains the GFC as well as Japan&#x27;s crash in the 80s, and even the Great Depression. It&#x27;s no coincidence that the worst financial crashes have come after some of the most successful runs of surpluses! This was actually the main sign seen by most of the analysts and economists who warned of the GFC in the years running up to it (there were 11 identified by Dirk Bezemer in 2009 who qualified a set of conditions under their research).<p>Sectoral Balances explains quite neatly also why austerity never work (unless you have a big trade surplus) - the more Government spending that is cut, the more that growth is reduced. So deficits aren&#x27;t really discretionary for the Federal Government, but are more determined by the economy. If you cut the deficit while the economy is performing badly, growth suffers and revenue is reduced (of course, the flip-side is that too-large a deficit would be inflationary). The deficit should approach zero as the economy reaches full employment and full capacity&#x2F;efficiency - but most economies aren&#x27;t really anywhere near full employment."

One thing I noticed is that the people who tend to come from LinkedIn ads, tend to be unemployed and of lower skill levels.  So LinkedIn is used a lot to find good people, but not for ad dollars.<p>Haven&#x27;t spent enough time with Twitter&#x27;s marketing tools to have an opinion one way or another on them.<p>While not a social network, I just keep coming back to Google Adwords, tends to produce the most most reliable results."

For instance there is a noticeable push for projects to go Apache which is GPLv2 incompatible.<p>OpenSSL is famously GPL incompatible but now it&#x27;s only GPLv2 incompatible. Likewise all GPLv3 code is GPLv2 incompatible so you effectively have two worlds that both have similar goals but cannot share code work together. This is particularly striking in the Linux environment where the kernel is v2 licensed and the user land pushes really hard on GPLv3.

Average income difference between families moving in and out of Illinois is over $20,000. The property taxes are second highest in the nation relative to COL and everyone agrees that they need to be increased to maintain the current budget. The state cut funding for all college grants programs and the average freshman class size at state schools has shrunk an average of more than 20% in two years. Illinois is the biggest exporter of students, and many never return. Pension costs are already 25% of the state budget and this is projected to increase.<p>The state is so deeply corrupt that bankruptcy seems inevitable. If not for the whole state at least Chicago. Madigan literally runs the state from the shadows and gov. Rauner has no real power.<p>The budget problems are accelerating at a frightening pace as anyone that can afford to leave the state does.

This is important because the signature script itself is unsigned data (a signature can&#x27;t sign itself), which means that it&#x27;s possible to change the signature script of a transaction, thus changing the transaction ID, and invalidating all transactions that pointed to the original transaction.

A and B lie on opposite sides of the globe and have essentially never had trade or direct contact.

Person Pb mops the floors in country B and gets paid $5.00&#x2F;hr. (You may wonder how we can define both of their incomes in dollars if the two countries have no contact; you can define a virtual exchange rate based on respective purchasing power, for instance).<p>Your interpretation states that there is a transfer of wealth from person Pa to... person Pb? Everyone in country B? Everyone in country A? It&#x27;s not clear, but any of those conclusions seems unreasonable. There is no causal connection between country A and country B, so there can be no wealth transfer between them. And how can the existence of country B, at the unknown and unreachable recesses of the earth, cause a wealth transfer within country A?<p>The more reasonable interpretation is the opposite: it is person Pb who is receiving a transfer of extra wealth. From whom? From the past and present inhabitants of country B, who have created the wealth, technology, infrastructure and knowledge that allows Pb to receive more for the same amount of work. This interpretation, unlike yours, is backed by clear causal connections.<p>I do agree, however, that people often fail to account for <i>this</i> transfer of wealth."

This means that should bitcoin fail spectacularly because of its scaling problems, litecoin would be the safe replacement choice, as it&#x27;s exactly the same thing, but without scalability issues - due to mentioned features recent add. It would be a bit sad not to replace bitcoin with a more modern coin, like ethereum, but that&#x27;s still something that could make litecoin relevant."

They will, however threaten to impound your vehicle for minor infractions (which would be illegal in most cases) and&#x2F;or threaten to jail you to wait for your court date. Either of these situations will require paperwork and the money goes to the state and not their pockets, so they make you wait and reconsider the bribe, but eventually let you go. Usually.<p>Also, in the context of this thread, having cash or money in the bank makes no difference because traffic stops now have portable card machines for &quot;spot fines&quot;!"

comment,14262938,,,1493879694,,ericd,"Morality is human defined, but it&#x27;s the set of ideas that, along with a society&#x27;s institutions, distinguishes a well functioning society from a corrupt and dysfunctional one. It&#x27;s the set of memes that allows us to function at the massive group scales that we operate at, that allows us to trust strangers to run things that are vital to our own survival. And when that breaks down, and people start acting in their short-sighted self interest (or you think you see them doing that, anyway), you start seeing that trust crack. I think we&#x27;ve been seeing that happening in the US for a while, and I think corporatism separated from a sense of decency and personal accountability while at work is a large part of the cause.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s right for a company to do what you describe wantonly. I absolutely think we should shame companies when they mistreat people.<p>And what you&#x27;re describing with your children is selfish, but it&#x27;s an understandable selfishness - your children are of course going to be a higher priority to you than society at large, as it is with almost all parents.<p>Anyway, my idea about the obligations of fulfilling one&#x27;s debts seems to be an unpopular one, and I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t change anyone&#x27;s mind, especially if they&#x27;ve chosen to take on a lot of debt themselves, so I&#x27;ll stop here."

This eliminates a huge swath of the population, mainly everyone that isn&#x27;t rich.<p>And again, I don&#x27;t dispute that there are other ways to kill. Only that most of them are vastly less efficient, reducing the possibility of sprees like those we see in the US.<p>Also 600 deaths is nothing to scoff at.

As soon as you require information about something other than the internal state of the chain, you have a problem. I believe some companies are attempting to implement solutions at the moment but I&#x27;m not familiar with the technology.<p>Crowd-funding is an already popular use case for blockchain contracts, as well as the creation of tradable tokens built on top of the platform. Decentralised exchanges are a nice idea but to my knowledge they are outclassed by the speed of centralised servers. Decentralised, &quot;fair&quot; casinos (such as Edgeless) are also possible with smart contracts but I think they won&#x27;t be able to compete with traditional casinos that have an edge but offer large and enticing welcome bonuses.<p>For a quick overview of some of Ethereum&#x27;s Dapps you can look at:

But I think it makes more sense to defer to expertise advice than to bury one&#x27;s head in the sand."

comment,14262830,,,1493878187,,flashmob,"&gt; Bitcoin has by far the greatest amount of research and intellectual effort driving it<p>It&#x27;s not like the research is exclusive. Note that any research done on bitcoin can also be shared and used on other projects. Litecoin for example, which is a fork of bitcoin, is now benefiting from bitcoin&#x27;s R&amp;D by using Segwit first.<p>Likewise, other blockchains can teach a lesson for bitcoin. For example sha256 proved not to be a good hashing algo because the reliance on ASICs, which centralizes mining. Another important area in research is the development of other greener forms of blockchain security such as Proof of Stake, which will most likely replace Proof Of Work once perfected.<p>In a way, when I think of bitcoin, I think of it as this whole massive umbrella project that includes all the alternative blockchain projects too, that can all share their research &#x2F; experiences &#x2F; ideas with each-other. This is the beauty of open source software."

comment,14262794,,,1493877813,,dlgeek,"So, Levandowski was trying to use the 5th Amendment to prevent Uber from disclosing, during discovery, the author of a report (in Uber&#x27;s possession, not Levandowski) that Uber was claiming was privileged.<p>There are a few issues here:
1.) 5A protections don&#x27;t generally cover the production of existing documents, only testimony (statements, answering questions).
2.) 5A doesn&#x27;t protect corporations, only individuals.
3.) It&#x27;s (apparently, per the discussions in the various court filings on this issue) incredibly rare to try to prevent the disclosure of the metadata on a privilege log. (Basically, during discovery, if you find a document that&#x27;s responsive to the discovery, but think it&#x27;s privilege from being turned over, you have to provide a report of what the document is, who has it, who has ever seen it, etc. to prove that it remains privileged.). 
4.) For someone who isn&#x27;t a party to the lawsuit to try to assert this is incredibly unusual.<p>The judge basically called the whole argument bullshit. But it was all related to the document stuff, not Levandowski&#x27;s testimony&#x2F;deposition."

Sure, Valve and Bethesda have probably contributed more gaming experiences to the world across their many games and their liberal policy towards modding. There are only a few Blizzard games, but they&#x27;re better and they make much more money. It&#x27;s a tightly controlled experience, but the quality control means Blizzard fans will at least try almost every Blizzard game at some point. Can&#x27;t say the same for Bethesda.

comment,14262590,,,1493874754,,greggman,"I still haven&#x27;t drunk the VR kool-aid.<p>I want to believe. I&#x27;ve used all the software. Played many games. The problems for me are 2 fold<p>1. I don&#x27;t have the space. I don&#x27;t personally know anyone that does. Maybe if you live in the mid-west or the suburbs but there are plenty of cities where people are unlikely to have a space for room scale VR and arguably the non-room scale VR is just not that compelling. Visiting a &quot;VR space&quot; is not ever going to be mainstream so that seems like an issue for mass VR adoption.<p>2. When I play a good non-VR game I play for hours and days at a time. As an example last month I played Zelda:Breath of the Wild for 70+ hours, 10-14 hours a day. I&#x27;ve yet to play anything in VR that I could stay in for 10-14 hours. In fact many VR games get extremely tiring very quickly. I&#x27;ve played a few where after 10 minutes I&#x27;m exhausted. That&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem likely to become a main form of entertainment.<p>I&#x27;ve also played at a few VR arcades. Again the games have been fun and immersive but the also felt like thrill rides. In other words, 5-10 minutes and I&#x27;m done. Neat experience but just like I could not ride a rollercoaster for 10hrs I can&#x27;t do VR for 10hrs. It&#x27;s not about the form, it&#x27;s about the activity. Searching a room, opening draws, pressing various floating buttons, holding virtual weapons. It&#x27;s tiring not relaxing like non VR games.<p>Those issues don&#x27;t seem solvable. They aren&#x27;t tech issues they&#x27;re inherent to the whole concept. Fixes for the space would require direct brain implants so you don&#x27;t actually move around, you just think you are. I don&#x27;t know if there is a solution to the 2nd. It&#x27;s one thing to push buttons to see Nathan Drake climb mountains. It&#x27;s another to actually do the climbing.<p>As for the article itself I was a little sad to see VR defined as only<p>&gt; VR… only tracking, rendering, and display. Tracking is the process of recording the user’s location and orientation in 3D space. Rendering is the process of constructing the appropriate image for a user. Display refers to the fidelity with which the hardware can produce the rendered image.&quot;<p>Even with the problems mentioned above there seems to still be low-hanging fruit.<p>If you want to be able to talk to people in VR you need to be able to emote. That means you need low-res cameras looking at your eyes and mouth so your avatar can show your expressions.<p>Similarly, 2 hands is not enough. I need censors on my feet and maybe knees, waist, elbows. In many VR experiences I&#x27;ve played things where bumping up against something with my waist or, kicking something away with my feet, using my knee to close a draw etc seem like natural actions that were thwarted by lack of input."

comment,14262569,,,1493874196,,developer2,"Yep. It&#x27;s a sad state we&#x27;re in. It&#x27;s just too risky to pay more for an app from a publisher who is not well-known. All too often, installing an app for $3-5+ is disappointing when you discover the app is not what you were expecting. I rarely pay for apps, simply because I&#x27;d have paid thousands of dollars over the lifetime of a single phone, only to uninstall 95% of apps after discovering it was not for me.<p>Is an in-app purchase <i>required</i> to offer something tangible? Instead of using ads and offering an in-app purchase to remove ads, I&#x27;d love to see cheap apps (ie: free or $0.99, without ads) with options for in-app purchases - maybe $3, $5, $10, $20 - that are nothing more than a voluntary donation to pay more for an app I find worthwhile.<p>If I could volunteer to pay more for apps <i>after using them for an extended period of time</i> (fully unlocked, no trial gimmicks), I&#x27;d likely have spent a lot more money than I have thus far. I won&#x27;t pay thousands for a bunch of crappy used-once apps, but I&#x27;d pay a few hundred for the bundle of apps I&#x27;ve kept."
comment,14262566,,,1493874115,,firebones,"From what I&#x27;ve seen, buybacks are often more about preventing dilution due to share-based compensation; they&#x27;re effectively a tax-advantaged dividend. However, they can also be a sign of a company that has no better idea for spending their capital, which can indicate a decline in the ROI of their R&amp;D. Could HP and IBM have done better with their cash over the last 10-15 years than buying back stock?  Share repurchases seem to obfuscate with plausible deniability whether the intent is to return capital in a tax-advantaged way, or whether there&#x27;s just a basic lack of faith in investing in new innovations."

comment,14262527,,,1493873281,,uiri,"I am not saying that any of this is practical for 99.99% of email users. In fact, I would venture to say the opposite - my suggestions are practical for less than 10 in 100,000 users. With that caveat, there are a variety of ways to make email more secure.<p>Every Unix system has a mail daemon as a core function. If you&#x27;ve ever seen &quot;This incident will be reported.&quot; because your user is not in the sudoers group, the incident gets reported via the local mail system. Mail servers today (outside of Microsoft&#x27;s Exchange servers) are still overwhelmingly Unix-like systems. A mail user just needs a Unix host, a username and ssh + mutt&#x2F;pine to access their mail in this way. Then an attacker needs to identify the unix host, the username and the ssh credentials. The first two bits are likely to be trivial - the Unix host is probably published in DNS MX records, and the username is probably the local part of the email address. The last part does not necessarily need to be a password. Good security practices will have it be an ssh keypair. ssh keypairs are provably computationally secure (until quantum computing comes along) and ssh private keys often also have passphrases. Other measures - like U2F security keys - can also be required as part of ssh authentication.<p>So this is probably the gold standard when it comes to security for an email inbox. Is there any way we can make this more usable so that a GUI mail client can be used? One answer is to run the mail client on the Unix host and use ssh X forwarding to display it on the client machine. Another answer is to run a POP or IMAP server on the Unix host, force TLS and use normal plaintext passwords over the TLS tunnel.<p>Both the ssh and the IMAPS solutions require some way to authenticate the server side of the connection. The ssh mechanism typically defaults to trust on first use, but since one is publishing DNS records anyways, a SSHFP (ssh fingerprint) record seems like a good additional step. The IMAPS solution requires re-authentication of the certificate for each session. I am not sure what the current state of the art is for this for IMAPS servers. I personally believe that the CA model used for HTTPS is severely flawed.<p>All of this to say that for the truly dedicated user of a certain minimum (but high!) level of technical sophistication, passwordless login everywhere is possible (ssh keys; or having the email client securely store the password for use with IMAPS)."

Even a lot of the theory we did cover was done through hands on activities, like creating our own databases so we had to know how things were stored and indexed efficiently.

In the USA when someone in government says something that you agree with, it may because they are sincere, or it may be because its what you want to hear. Politicians, and humans in political roles, may <i>lie</i>. Lying is when they say something that isn&#x27;t true. They may do this for many reasons. A common reason is when they want an outcome X, and they say to you that they don&#x27;t want outcome X. &quot;Oh thank goodness! They don&#x27;t want outcome X either! I can go about my business.&quot; They might say they &quot;don&#x27;t want a backdoor&quot;. Technically, this isn&#x27;t even a lie. Comey does <i>not</i> intend to put a backdoor on your phone. Your phone is not a house. Clearly it cannot have a door. But Comey very much wants to be able to decrypt the information on your phone and says so specifically and at great length. A technical person would call this &quot;a backdoor&quot;. It is clearly not a backdoor, and no form of door will be installed on your phone. When Comey says &quot;we dont want access to devices built in in someway&quot;, what he means is that of course your phone wont be built with the access mechanism. Your phone is an inert piece metal, plastic and silicon etc. What he wants is that when your phone is first connected to electrical power, at the factory, <i>then</i> it will have the access software installed. Not <i>built in</i>, but <i>installed at the factory</i>.<p>If you are curious about how you might incorporate what people say into your reasoning about reality and outcomes, this is a good book: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0029117062"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility&#x2F;dp&#x2F;002...</a>"

And he&#x27;s right, consumers will see certain benefits -- like zero-rating -- while that consolidation is occurring. But then, afterwards, we&#x27;ll be stuck relearning the lessons of Standard Oil and Pacific Bell all over again."

comment,14262275,,,1493869330,,analog31,"Sometimes I wonder if things like fashions, art, music, etc., could get us out of an economy that depends so much on carbon emission. I was once at a Mary Kay convention (as a hired musician), and a few of the people were trying to sell the band members on joining the business.<p>I asked them if you can get a pink Prius for selling enough stuff. The answer is yes.<p>I suggested that cosmetics were the ultimate &quot;green&quot; product, because you could sell something with virtually no material content for an arbitrary price, and that Mary Kay should position itself that way. Could we support an entire economy, selling luxury goods to one another, with minimal ecological cost?"

It is not really conceivable that all these people are capable of taking on jobs which require complex thinking, judgment, creativity, or other higher skills.<p>There are plenty of &quot;low-skill&quot; jobs that nonetheless require human labor in some form because of the ability of humans -- even less intellectual humans -- to think creatively and contort themselves both mentally and physically.<p>Imagine a robot that does everything a school janitor can do. That simply won&#x27;t exist in the near future. Sure, maybe the janitor won&#x27;t have to mop large floors anymore.

comment,14262137,,,1493867553,,dangerlibrary,"The classic paper on minimum wage hikes and employment rates is Card and Krueger.<p>On April 1, 1992 New Jersey&#x27;s minimum wage increased from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after the rise in the minimum. Comparisons of the changes in wages, employment, and prices at stores in New Jersey relative to stores in Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage remained fixed at $4.25 per hour) yield simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. Our empirical findings challenge the prediction that a rise in the minimum reduces employment. Relative to stores in Pennsylvania, fast food restaurants in New Jersey increased employment by 13 percent. We also compare employment growth at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (and were unaffected by the new law) to employment changes at lower-wage stores. Stores that were unaffected by the minimum wage had the same employment growth as stores in Pennsylvania, while stores that had to increase their wages increased their employment.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w4509"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w4509</a>"

comment,14262011,,,1493865679,,aub3bhat,"Arguing deaths due to &lt;x&gt; happened more frequently than terrorism in some time period is useless, if the underlying process that generates those numbers are widely different.<p>Rather than thinking in terms of mortality rate over a period, its more accurate to think in terms of events. A single lightning bolt strike can at most affect 0 ~ 10 people with a gaussian distribution. A terrorist attack on the other hand has a long tail distribution and can cause 10^0 ~ 10^4 deaths.<p>There is no organized cult going around making lightening bolts with explicit intention of causing large scale harm. On the other hand there are several organized terrorist groups which are intentionally trying to do that. As far as being overweight or bad driving habits, billions of dollars are poured into health care system, automated driving and regulations with goal of reducing deaths due to them."

That exploitation led to many small scale wars (armed and civil). Towards the end of the British empire, many Brits lost their wealth and investments in colonies.<p>&gt;&gt; What we did have was protections so that first world people weren&#x27;t competing with third world labor laws. Now the thought of any kind of tariff protection is heresy.<p>UK is nothing special on this planet. God didn&#x27;t come one day and say, &quot;Hey, you guys are special. You guys deserve better labor laws at the expense of your colonies. Here&#x27;s all the wealth of the world for you.&quot;<p>The wealth, luxury and healthcare that is afforded by the average British is a consequence of colonization (a form of globalization) which started from 1600s. Let&#x27;s look at the historical timeline:<p>1600-1950: This was the time when third world people were fighting and dying for resources because the British empire exploited them. All the labor protections the British people got was because of the massive wealth extraction from other countries. There simply was more wealth per citizen.<p>1200-1500: Before above wealth, Britain had the same labor laws as the &quot;third world&quot;.<p>Looks like the rest of the world is not a slave to colonization any more and are making the most of it. Do you disagree they don&#x27;t deserve to try to improve their lives?<p>If UK recedes from the global market, nobody gives a fuck to be honest. Other countries will find a way to continue trade without the UK and keep building their own wealth."

If the laptop wasn&#x27;t normally used, that&#x27;s a fairly regular thing to do if you want to set up the laptop to get access legitimately.<p>All the data was downloaded, but reading between the lines, that&#x27;s just a SVN checkout, which is going to get everything in the repo by default unless you request a specific subdirectory.<p>A few days later a UDB drive is attached for numerous hours.<p>A few days after that, another operating system is installed, and the laptop is almost never used again.<p>All of this can be explained away as benign, but it&#x27;s also possible it was intended to look that way.  This could just as easily be explained as someone trying to access thee data and obscure the fact as it could be someone trying to set up a work laptop they plan to use while away from the office for a few days when they haven&#x27;t bothered for to set it up for years prior because they had no need.<p>This would look a lot more damning if Google was asserting that Levandowski was not supposed to have access to the SVN, or had not needed any access to it prior to this point, but unless I&#x27;m missing it, they aren&#x27;t saying that (although they do a good job of making it easy to assume that).<p>That said, that he set up the company that would later become Otto prior to all this access (with the assurance it would not compete), and also noted to numerous people that he planned to start his own self driving car company prior to the above actions (both according to the original filing though), does cast them in a somewhat different light.  That there is evidence of other people that left exporting specific documents from Drive days and&#x2F;or hours prior to their departure <i>does not look good</i>."

In all of those other languages, exceptions are used for normal error handling in addition to &quot;fatal&quot; events. In Go, panics, if used at all, are generally used for fatal runtime errors (memory, segfault, etc), or in place of assert, and indicates a fatal, unrecoverable flaw in your program.<p>At every job I&#x27;ve worked at it was generally discouraged to handle MemoryError exceptions in python and OutOfMemoryError exceptions in Java.

comment,14261813,,,1493862658,,KallDrexx,"&gt; Members of our government are so indoctrinated about stopping &quot;terrorism&quot; that they have lost all sense of perspective. Terrorism is a political word to describe political enemies of the state, yet the patriot act and surveillance machinery has been used in enforcement of many other kinds of (less serious) crime.<p>You are looking at the problem wrong.  It has nothing to do with government indoctrination but an issue with incentives.  The FBI&#x27;s whole job is to investigate potentially illegal acts and as human beings they are incentivized to do their job as well as they can.  When the opportunity comes up to give them more tools to do their job no one in the FBI is going to say &quot;no I want to continue with one hand behind my back&quot;.<p>The exact same thing happens at companies.  Companies with poorly aligned incentives will quickly see employees act against the will of the company as a whole to make sure they look and come across as best as possible, and any chance a decision comes up to help them do their job better they will fight for it, because not doing so is pretty dumb.<p>Well run companies work around these incentive issues by trying to get everyone aligned with checks and balances.  We don&#x27;t have that in the government because the people who are supposed to be doing the checks and balances (congress) have incentives to follow the FBI&#x27;s requests because of the political suicide of coming out against solving crimes and defeating terrorists.  It can (and will) be used against them at election time and their checks and balances (us as voters) fall for it all the time because we (as a collective whole) are short sighted and scared that something might happen and don&#x27;t want to be someone who voted for someone soft on security.<p>The only way to realign the incentives back for societal good is to get the common voter to understand the bigger implications of issues and hold our elected officals accountable.  Until that happens the incentiives are always going to be aligned for the government to gain power."

comment,14261798,,,1493862402,,nine_k,"One way to fight terrorism is refusing to be terrorized.<p>The goal of terrorists is inflicting terror and reactions following from the terror. Terror suppresses reason, so the reactions become less reasonable and thus detrimental to the attacked side.<p>By this measure, terrorists have unquestionably won. The Western societies under attack suppress their core values after the attacks, such as openness, free speech, tolerance to a variety of views, and primacy of reason and right over force.

OK, but when you have people investing multiple millions at a 100mm+ valuation, on an unproven team (and this is a charitable description in many cases), pre-product, there is a risk that the opportunity is being mispriced. There is a conflict -- on one hand, an ICO is &quot;fairer&quot; to developers in that they receive immediate compensation, and a larger share of the opportunity for the work they are doing. On the other hand, this mechanic is highly prone to fraud and abuse."

“What does this consumer think about Fisher and Paykel right now?”
“Will this consumer buy another Fisher and Paykel fridge?”<p><i></i> The answers are likely to be:
Well I am unhappy because my Fisher and Paykel fridge just died.
I am even more unhappy because Fisher and Paykel charged me $149 to tell me my fridge had just died.
I need a new fridge, and it cost an extra $149 because I got a service call first instead of immediately replacing the fridge.<p>My fridge should have lasted longer than 8 to 10 years but it’s probably similar to the life of other such products in the 21st century.  It doesn’t matter much to me.
The answer to this question should matter ALOT to Fisher and Paykel.  Right now you know I need a new fridge and you also know that how I feel about Fisher and Paykel is either negative or neutral.  You should fix the relationship and give me incentive to buy again from you.<p>When Fisher and Paykel sends a service guy, who says the fridge is dead, Fisher and Paykel should charge me $0, not $149.

During that time several corporstions (particularly pharma) had factories and jobs there. During that time there was a boom in bond sales - a lot of predatory practices that are reminiscent of the US housing bubble were done there, too. Once the tax loophole was closed, corporations left the island, jobs went to shit, the bonds could not be repaid, and all well, you get the picture. Except that in this case, &quot;not paying debt&quot;, literally means not paying a huge chunk of all the life savings that people poured (arguably even patriotically) to their own bond system (see the parallels to the housing crisis?).<p>You could technically boost the enconomy there by reintroducing similar tax loopholes, but it would be a temporary fix, and there would be significant struggles in the Senate and Congress...

take a piece of paper, divide it in 2. 
one the left side write down: 
we share: 
-vision(do we have the same goal, do we see the future in the same way...), 
-commitment (do we want to spend a good part of our life together, what come first? startup, life or family?)<p>one the right side write down:
we differ in:
-orientation(you need both; one who see the bigger picture and one who pay close attention to the smaller stuff)
-expertise (complement each other)
and always assume the best but plan for the worst ;)
check your own network and think deeply who you can imagine working with. go to local(if possible) founders event(check on meetup)
if you still don&#x27;t find a co-founder, apply for a start-up weekend or hackathon (you can work on a project over the weekend, it give you a bit of an insight who you are dealing with.

comment,14261426,,,1493856958,,magicalist,"&gt; <i>Basically the output is the unrolled version of the recursion, which cuts down on function invocation (comparatively expensive in dynamic languages).</i><p>You&#x27;re right about why it&#x27;s included, but this is a bug, not a feature. If this is a hot function it&#x27;ll be optimized. The recursive call is a known, non-dynamic invocation so the function location will be inlined leaving just the fairly low function call overhead itself. There&#x27;s a reason nobody does arbitrary-length loop unrolls.<p>I would definitely bet that this is a bug to be fixed :) Right now you can see this if you call fib(20) in that example...the compiler times out while trying to unroll that far. Clearly that behavior won&#x27;t stick around."

comment,14261399,,,1493856650,,grandalf,"&gt; Wiretapping and search warrants...<p>True, but there is a big difference between presenting evidence to a judge to obtain a search warrant and subsequently manually wiretapping a phone line or two and the sort of massive-scale surveillance&#x2F;capture we have today.<p>It&#x27;s like the difference between a doctor examining an awake patient who has complained about a specific symptom... vs to a doctor sneaking into the bedroom of thousands of sleeping non-patients and performing a secret physical exam on their genitals just in case anything about their genitals seems alarming.<p>The crime (building the illegal infrastructure to do that surveillance) is now justified after the fact by a fairly quaint comparison to traditional police work.<p>As much as I&#x27;d like to, I don&#x27;t believe that surveillance is about police work.  It&#x27;s about political intimidation which is identical to the kind of political intimidation that seems obvious when talking about other police states from history.<p>The effects of intimidation are not obvious as everyone expects them to be.  I&#x27;ll make an analogy with the North Korean regime to illustrate my point.<p>How is it possible that the leader of N. Korea is able to make statements to the public that are obviously absurd.  Are people in N. Korea less rational than elsewhere? Less intelligent?  No, but over time the range of ideas considered acceptable has adapted to include some of the most ludicrous (and contradicted by fact) claims imaginable.<p>How does this happen?  I think it happens gradually.  How likely are we to loudly criticize our government when we know all our devices contain a hot mic and all the audio might be getting recorded?  Maybe we still offer a criticism but we couch it a bit or we follow it with some praise.  Small things like this mean that we all hear less criticism, less scrutiny, less dissent.  All because we are not sure who is listening or who will be reported to authorities for holding a controversial view.<p>Over the course of decades, perfectly intelligent, rational people in N. Korea are easily able to believe some fairly outlandish claims simply because of a few decades of secret police presence and fear of being reported.<p>What does this have to do with the US?  By definition, terrorism is a political crime. It causes intimidation and fear.  It is designed to be asymmetrical and sporadic, and is impossible to stop.  The only way to fight it is with extreme social control... a more compliant society where holders of nonstandard beliefs are more easily identified.<p>If the surveillance data had not been used to fight non-terrorism crimes, or if the systems were designed with a cryptographically provable audit trail, I&#x27;d consider the possibility that this was just a more modern way of doing law enforcement.  But sadly I think all of the evidence points in the other direction."

comment,14261339,,,1493855910,,derefr,"The NES&#x2F;SNES era had a lot of games that use sprite animation state&#x2F;OAM memory as the canonical place to hold the current state of something. Often even important, high-level pieces of game business-logic state, were just left as sprite attributes on particular sprites.<p>Two examples from Super Mario World (which loves this technique):<p>• You can avoid dying from running out of time in SMW, by simply getting a power-up right as the level timer reaches zero. The level timer just changes the Mario sprite&#x27;s animation to STATE_DYING (once, when transitioning from 1 to 0); so if you can get the <i>sprite</i> to play a different animation, the game forget that the player was supposed to be dead.<p>• The &quot;null sprite&quot; glitch: Yoshi &#x27;carries around&#x27; enemies in his mouth by just 1. marking the enemy sprite as invisible and intangible, and then 2. storing a pointer to said enemy sprite. If you can get that sprite to unload from OAM memory and get something else to take its place, then when Yoshi goes to spit the enemy out, he&#x27;ll instead spit out whatever random garbage is now at the OAM location referenced by the pointer."

It&#x27;s not for running production services and it&#x27;s not polished, but it&#x27;s very powerful.<p>It comes with a combined bootstrap and control script which has been tested with  Ubuntu 16.0.4 and mac os. Windows and other distros will follow, but it should work on anything x86 which runs Vagrant and Virtualbox if you do some manual setup - the readme in the repo gives a kind-of-detailed&#x2F;kind-of-hand-wavy explanation of how to set it up manually.<p>I should highlight up front that this was made as both a learning exercise and to solve problems I experienced specifically when working on isolated container ecosystems. It was built out organically so there&#x27;s a lot of tidying up to be done, and I&#x27;ve cut corners here and there to get it out the door. There&#x27;s no scaling or clustering, and you shouldn&#x27;t attempt to run production services on it. You <i>can</i> enable an external interface in the vagrantfile to present the containers on your LAN, but you&#x27;d be wise not to expose it to the internet in its current state. I aim to move it towards something tidy and secure which exports production ready containers and stacks in the future, but for now, it is what it is.<p>I also haven&#x27;t included a license. I wanted to ask you guys for opinions on which license I should run with. I&#x27;ve read loads about the various different licenses, I&#x27;d like to see some discussion on the pros and cons from people with experience before making a decision.<p>Anyway, with that all out of the way...<p>Nedoka lets you control containers, stacks, segments and groups of stacks with painfully straightforward syntax. Your container landscape is defined in yml files anywhere within a config directory tree, and specs can be wired up however you want, regardless of where they live. Any spec can be a container, a stack, both or neither, and can have children which inherit and extend its settings. Stacks&#x2F;containers&#x2F;partials can contain dependencies which come up when required, and can include other containers and stacks, and merge containers, stacks and partials together to create new things.<p>It sounds a bit wild, but it&#x27;s all very straightforward in practice, the end result being that you can wire any number of arbitrarily complex builds and environments together however you want, and control any portion, portions or the entirety of it as easily as you can a single container.<p>Aside from letting you mash configs together to create all manner of ridiculous superstructures, there&#x27;s a lot more going on. Tags anywhere in your specs will generate and&#x2F;or retrieve vault&#x2F;consul based secrets, create and switch users portably, trigger actions on the host or other containers, split layers, inject cache busters, pull environment variables and so forth. Specs can have onbuild, onrun, post-start, pre-backup, post-restore, host post-run, host post-destroy, and arbitrary (and extremely handy) helper scripts defined inline, and can be accompanied by file structures and&#x2F;or database dumps which are injected into the resulting builds automatically at baseline.<p>When containers come up, .test DNS records are created on split views for traffic kicking around within the VM and over a hostonly interface. If you uncomment the external interface in the vagrantfile, containers with endpoints will be presented over a shared IP with reverse proxying where relevant. If you enable ipvlan i the settings and provide some basic network config, containers with defined service endpoints will automatically join an ipvlan bridge where they&#x27;ll act as distinct endpoints on the LAN.<p>Specs can specify service endpoints and port forwarding. HTTP endpoints are automatically reverse proxied. HTTPS endpoints will be reverse proxied and a certificate will be created and signed by a local CA.<p>A basic database abstraction layer handles the creation, backup and destruction of postgres, mysql and mariadb databases and users - add a db to a spec and it will be created automatically and backed up&#x2F;restored alongside the container. Databases are treated as persistent, but can be destroyed or restored on demand. Environment variables for accessing databases are injected into the containers they&#x27;re defined in automatically.<p>Backups of containers or stacks can be taken manually and will happen automatically on the destruction of a container, restores happen similarly transparently on run, but you can baseline or restore to previous restore points whenever you want.<p>It covers a lot of ground, and I&#x27;m sure for some people it will break in weird and wonderful ways (you can generally just restart supervisor or the VM, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of bugs I haven&#x27;t come across) there are also some obvious pain points such as manual renaming and repacking of backups being needed if you want to change a container&#x27;s name, there is no API or web frontend yet, and it needs a lot of polish, &quot;but other than that it&#x27;s fine&quot; :)<p>I&#x27;m very fond of Nedoka, not just as the creator but as an end user too. I can&#x27;t wait to see what people make with it."

Our iOS users save an average of $106 a year in parking tickets<p>We started building Spot Angels the day we got our car towed and had to pay $569 to get it back :)
The idea behind SpotAngels is simple. The app sends you reminders before street cleaning, tow away or any other parking restriction without requiring any action from you.<p>The app knows all the restrictions in 25 cities including SF, NYC, LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle and London. 
The data is more than 95% accurate and constantly updated by the community.<p>If you have a Bluetooth speaker in your car, you can connect it to the app and it will automatically save your parking location and set up a reminder for you. When you turn off your car, the Bluetooth disconnects from the app and your parking location is saved. 
If you don&#x27;t have a Bluetooth speaker, you just need to open the app and save your parking location each time you want to set-up a parking reminder.<p>I hope you will enjoy it. Please let me know if you have any questions!"

Your two points are in direct contradiction.<p>It is possible that he realizes 99.9999% (read the Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville) of investors are far better off with S&amp;P500 index investing than actively picking stocks, and that he doesn&#x27;t need to tell the 0.0001% anything because their skill will manifest itself."

Points you then pointedly ignore when replying.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be asked what you&#x27;re saying precisely, you just have to provide more detail earlier, or at the very least the proper rubrik. I just don&#x27;t understand the hostility here mixed into factual matters.<p>There&#x27;s little to answer in your last post. Your definition of gradual was decades; re solar power it&#x27;s already been decades, but the actual transitions to new technologies - the mass adoptions - happen quickly - so you&#x27;re really changing the subject. The first consumer product (radio) to appear in my city with transistors came in the early sixties, at a price of $79 - a fortune then - but only a few years after that, you couldn&#x27;t buy a regular radio with tubes. The transition was very rapid. Kodak&#x27;s stock took a long time to fall to earth, but the loss of revenue was sudden, and massive.<p>Re transmission - solar will strongly tend to be local. Batteries: you can look up discussions of Vanadium batteries (just one novel tech) elsewhere on HN, but note that individual batteries are now being built that are nearly 1GW - so 50,000 GW is very far from impossible - even if that figure turns out to be accurate. Not impossible at 5 cents a watt. Betting that this or that is impossible is usually a bad bet.

The effect of a government bankruptcy on the economy and the society (present and future) is not really comparable to the effect of a bankruptcy amongst individual economic agents. Those are completely different scales.<p>Also, morality is always attached to anything which involves society and its institutions. For example, good faith in contracts (bona fides) which has evolved all the way from the roman republic is an example of codified morality which proved to be quite useful in societal transactions (i.e. it solidifies expectations of behavior and hastens transactions).

comment,14261066,,,1493853024,,partycoder,"In healthcare, you have HIPAA and if you mess up patient records you can lose your license, be subject to legal actions. e.g: leaking 1 patient record.<p>If a pharmaceutical company releases a drug that causes negative side effects, lawyers are happy to sue the company on your behalf for free.<p>But software engineering is a discipline where no license is required, and now thanks to informal educational institutions like coding camps, not even a degree is required. You can ruin the lives of millions of people but always hop around and get another job.<p>Companies maximize their margin saving money on security (and other non-functional requirements), and expose customer sensitive information to significant risks with no accountability. A statement like &quot;Sorry! we got hacked, your SSN and credit card information is now being sold by the bulk in an .onion site!&quot; would do. We as consumers should punish those incidents more aggressively and demand a reasonable cause.<p>The product-driven minimum-viable-product lean-agile full-stack get-it-done culture of spaghetti code bases without security needs to die now. It&#x27;s highly profitable and the preferred business model for many, yes. Is it ethical? hell no. Stop doing it. In those cultures, security is treated as &quot;tin-foil hat paranoia&quot; and laughed upon, and put into some &quot;nice to have&quot;&#x2F;&quot;maybe some day&quot; list, with the lowest priority.<p>A security bug can make it into any software. But if you assembled a team of coding camp guys or fresh graduates to work on a banking platform or making an IoT pacemaker you deserve to be sued for neglicence.<p>Unfortunately because software is a relatively new activity compared to others, there is no established legal framework around it and that needs fixing."

comment,14261036,,,1493852791,,NTDF9,"&gt;&gt; There is a very interesting failure of imagination of the remain campaign in assuming that their best interests were the same as other people&#x27;s, and denigrating or dismissing other people&#x27;s concerns as due to stupidity or racism. The Brexit vote result is a comeupance for this self-serving elite.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that they didn&#x27;t vote with their best interest at heart. But best self-interest with incomplete information can lead to disasters.<p>Let&#x27;s say brexit causes some other country in EU to become the financial powerhouse of the region, means a lot of jobs get out of the UK, which means more strain on social services and lower value of investments already made by said voters, which means poorer retirement.<p>The above could well be right or wrong. But do you really think the average citizen actually thought about all this? Or did they just charge out because they &quot;felt&quot; left out?<p>Given a choice, most citizens&#x27; self interest dictates cheap housing, education and healthcare with lower taxes.

comment,14261012,,,1493852568,,FullMtlAlcoholc,"Limited liability, along with joint stock ownership, was possibly the greatest financial invention of all time. In terms of big history, I would mark the inception of this form of human social organization as the beginning of &quot;The Great Acceleration.&quot; To a great degree, this is also why the West became so dominant until recent times, allowing for the building of then state of the art ships to undergo risky trade and exploration missions. Without it, no one besides monarchs would invest for fear of being financially ruined for the rest of their lives.<p>Conflating personal morality with economics... is very bad. It leads to things like debtor&#x27;s prisons (which, unfortunately, exists more or less in America) and heavily prejudices against poorer people. It&#x27;s an easy to understand system... you borrow money, you pay it back with interest. Its the lender&#x27;s responsibility to ascertain your credit worthiness. If you default, it becomes harder for you to get credit and you pay higher interest. There is no need to also attach negative behavioral characteristics. Lets face it, we all know someone who is bad with money, but that doesnt make them a bad person, it just means they need an accountant.<p>How many times has the President declared bankruptcy? I have many issues with Trump but this is not one of them. in fact, I commend him for being able to reinvent himself by learning how to create an effective brand and sell his name.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye if a company made a controversial decision, like laying off a number of workers for the benefit of shareholders.

The definition of capitalism I use is based on the capitalist mode of production, that is, how goods are made within a capitalist economy, viz. production to maximise exchange value over use value, the primacy of wage labour, private (and yes, this can include the state&#x27;s) ownership of social means of production, and most social production is for the goal of capital accumulation.<p>In my opinion this is enough to say that a particular society is &#x27;capitalist&#x27;, though like all words there are variety of nuances and exceptions and additions that can be attached. Capitalism in my view neither necessitates nor excludes government controls on production, social democratic policies, taxes, the state (except for defense of private property) etc.<p>A good example of a capitalist (state capitalist) country is the Soviet Union."

comment,14260805,,,1493850672,,lf275,"True, I don&#x27;t look at it as an ethical failure either way. I am saying, however, that the public&#x2F;federal government have an interest in maintaining the perception that that is a one-off and state&#x2F;local governments are reliable borrowers. If a string of bankruptcies happen in a short time window, this could quickly erode the perception that state governments are reliable, and negatively impact many other states that are struggling and need low-interest financing just to pay the bills.<p>For anybody who has taken a look at the balance sheets of public entities, it is shocking how poorly capitalized many of these local governments actually are, and how aggressive some of their financial assumptions are (with low interest rates and 50% of their capital held in debt, a 8% assumed rate of return is extremely aggressive, and they would need financial rock-stars to achieve this at their scale). If investors are spooked, then interest rates could spike for many other government loans, and cause contagion among local government entities that would eventually require the federal government to intervene."

comment,14260616,,,1493849112,,paulmd,"The secret is that Buffett <i>isn&#x27;t</i> beating the market by 7-10% a year over decades.  He&#x27;s not a hedge fund prodigy, he&#x27;s a management prodigy.<p>His companies beat the market because he is the antithesis of the quarterly-numbers-driven model of Wall Street.  He focuses on fundamentals, long-term value, and having leadership that&#x27;s on the same page.  He makes sure his businesses aren&#x27;t underspending on fundamentals or overspending on inessentials, and then he gets out of the way.<p>Saying that Buffett &quot;beats the market&quot; is like saying that a sports coach is really good at picking winning teams.  His companies outperform the market because Buffett enables them to outperform the market.<p>(on top of that, yes, he&#x27;s a savvy investor and he&#x27;s made some ballsy calls - but absent his management I doubt you would see him doing better than the 2% that other actively-managed funds can earn above the market return)"

comment,14260610,,,1493849087,,chamakits,"I was born and raised in PR, but have since moved.<p>100% of our politics surround this very question. The 3 mayor political parties are one pro statehood, one pro staying with the current status, one pro independence. The first two have always dominated, and only these past elections we had a candidate without a party make a dent in elections.<p>I&#x27;m saying all this to say, that the statehood (or lack of) is a very complex subject for Puerto Rico, both for real logical reasons and also for equally valid emotional ones.<p>To keep it simple though, statehood is a possibility, in as far as there may be a time where a majority may desire it. However, Puerto Rico doesn&#x27;t really have much say on, other than voting to say if PR as a whole are in favor of it or not. So far, past votes, the results are no. But even if it&#x27;s ever a &quot;yes&quot;, we don&#x27;t control it that happens or not. The US does."

comment,14260448,,,1493847909,,anigbrowl,"As I said (but should probably have said at the beginning rather than the end) I think the use of civil forfeiture in practice is frequently horribly corrupt. While the basic idea has merit - we don&#x27;t want criminals to profit from ill-gotten gains - the application of that principle frequently turns into an asymmetrical and highly politicized contest between who can better manipulate the rules, to the point of drastically undermining respect for the principles they were established to uphold.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that I don&#x27;t always make it clear enough when I&#x27;m making a narrow technical argument vs when I&#x27;m making a sweeping ideological one. I am 100% against police departments being able to profit from civil asset forfeiture, both because the incentives for abuse become overwhelming and because the existence of abuse is then used by others as a pretext for undermining the system within which such rules originate.<p>My personal concepts of the relation between individuals, society, government, law, and justice, are radically outside the mainstream, which is why you should consider switching to a monarchy and installing me as King, or Queen. On the other hand, distilling those radical ideas down to a manageable set of operational principals that don&#x27;t require everyone to be a philosopher is difficult, which is why you should probably hold off on the coronation for a bit."

comment,14260406,,,1493847621,,rebootthesystem,"In the US it is extremely easy to rack-up hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.  A single operation can cost $200K.  Be ill for an extended period of time and the idea of millions of dollars in medical care isn&#x27;t out of the realm of the possible.<p>And so, imagine selling the family home to try to pay medical bills or provide more favorable circumstances only to get a knock on the door by the Medicaid estate recovery folks who have first dibs on the proceeds of the sale.<p>Not only that, the sale also means the patient is now kicked off Medicaid because they have money.<p>I&#x27;ll repeat it because the shift in perspective is important:<p>If a private insurance company had exactly the same clauses in their policies people would be up in arms, they would be brought up on charges and some of their management would land in jail.  Yet we are willing to accept this from our government?  And enroll people by the tens of millions?<p>This should not be.  We should provide care to the needy without any such preconditions.  Our government should not sink hooks into them at all.<p>Readers seem to be confusing passion for fear mongering.  This is real and, as far as I am concerned, it is seriously immoral.  We should not be in the business of doing this to our own citizens.  This isn&#x27;t health insurance.  Not sure what it is, but I know what it is not.<p>This is the point that is being missed in my exposure of this issue:  This is an abomination.  The US should not have a program fraudulently presented as insurance that takes people&#x27;s property at all.

comment,14260367,,,1493847333,,rebootthesystem,"Perhaps I am being too idealistic.<p>I believe that with the right leadership and a conversation with the nation we could converge on a system that was fair, took care of the needy and got government and insurance companies as we know them to day out of the system to the necessary degree.<p>I don&#x27;t, for a moment, believe that we can get both government and insurance companies entirely out of the system in the US.  In the first instance, government, you would not want to.  Oversight and rules are important.  In the second instance, insurance companies, there could be an argument of their need in absorbing some of the risk.  Admittedly, not an easy problem.<p>What we have today, this hodge-podge of laws, agencies and programs is a complete disaster.  This should be obvious and evident to anyone who takes the time to take a full dive into the absolute mess healthcare is in the US.  The ACA did not fix anything, it made it worst, because it isn&#x27;t a real solution.<p>I won&#x27;t claim to have the solution.  As I alluded above, this requires leadership that can bring forth a national-level conversation that, over a year or four, can converge on something that can deal with all issues equitably.<p>One angle is what I might term a to be a moral obligation:  We have the moral obligation to take care of each other.  What follows, then, is that we all contribute to a fund or a national health insurance policy of some sort that covers absolutely everyone with, perhaps, reasonable co-pay&#x27;s to take some of the edge off.  If one of us needs a million dollars of medical care he or she should be able to get it.<p>This should also come with some obligations.  I think there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the idea of requiring regular checkups of some sort.  This is where it gets complicated.  What do we do about people who destroy themselves through substance abuse.  I don&#x27;t know how we deal with that and other matters.<p>Anyhow, I think we can all agree that we ought to be able to do far, far better than this mess created by our politicians in playing sick partisan games with one of our most basic needs.  And this has been true over at least the last 50 years, no political party is devoid of blood (almost literally) on their hands.<p>We truly need to take this up to a much higher intellectual level in order to converge on a good solution.<p>It is interesting to see the reaction had on HN when someone like me, who recognizes the emperor has no clothes, comes along to critique a very real problem with one of these programs, Medicaid.  The reaction is evidence of the political polarization out there and the disconnect that exists with what politicians have done to our healthcare system.  It&#x27;s a mess and what we have isn&#x27;t getting any better."

comment,14260286,,,1493846805,,dragandj,"There are other models other than two extremes. For example, in (at least some) European countries there is not such thing as private person going bankrupt. However, of course that that person won&#x27;t be sold to slavery. Simply, if you can not repay the loan, your property will be confiscated and sold to repay it. You can dodge that by not having any property on your name, of course, and most such people do that, but that also means having no flow on your bank account (everything over a small life-sustaining minimum would be taken every month).<p>That is at least in theory. Since a considerable part of the economy is in the gray zone, there are ways of dodging that. Large part of the law system is corrupt, so well connected people always find a way to be untouchable. The system is also inefficient so lots of those debts exist just on paper.
Basically, you can&#x27;t go bankrupt as a person, and you wont be sold to slavery, but you will effectively still own the debt and the only way to not repay it is to work in the black zone outside of the system, or wait so long that the lenders write it off themselves (after a few decades or so?)."

Social fun like Rec Room, or RPG&#x27;s, or MMOs, or shooters, or playing pool, or pingpong, etc. Its a varied experience and I think its a little dismissive to say something like &quot;Oh but its only games now?&quot; Games are huge! Why are we discounting this incredible part of the human experience and something part of all human cultures? This is like saying, &quot;Oh you&#x27;re in love and getting married? That&#x27;s just endorphins and patriarchy.&quot;  Its dismissive to an extreme.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve watched a bit of youtube with my Vive and can certainly see it making in-roads with consumption of media, but even the best pool simulators, gun range, or pingpong simulators not only feel nothing like the real thing, but they&#x27;re barely a fraction of the fun of the real thing. If futurists are banking on VR replacing many real experiences, well, they better be ready to be disappointed. VR&#x27;s strengths aren&#x27;t being a digital version of real experiences, its making fantastic worlds and experiences of its own that feel &#x27;real&#x27; and interesting."

ranging from 1,110 km to 1,325 km). SpaceX has proposed an additional constellation of 7,500 satellites operating even closer to Earth.<p>For the end consumer, SpaceX user terminals—essentially, a relatively small flat panel, roughly the size of
a laptop—will use phased array technologies to allow for highly directive, steered antenna beams
that track the system’s low-Earth orbit satellites. In space, the satellites will communicate with each other
using optical inter-satellite links, in effect creating a “mesh network” flying overhead that will enable
seamless network management and continuity of service.<p>Later this year, SpaceX will begin the process of testing the satellites themselves, launching one prototype
before the end of the year and another during the early months of 2018. Following successful demonstration
of the technology, SpaceX intends to begin the operational satellite launch campaign in 2019. The
remaining satellites in the constellation will be launched in phases through 2024, when the system will
reach full capacity."

Over time I purchased more parts, hit up the Lego-Pitsco-Dacta store to get others (stuff like pneumatic pieces and gears), and a few of the Mindstorms expansion sets...<p>I sunk several hundred into it all before I came to realization that it wasn&#x27;t cost effective; today I know it isn&#x27;t.<p>If you want to prototype (or outright build) robotic systems, just go with &quot;raw&quot; materials (especially surplus or junkyard pulls). Small scale stuff can be easily bodged together with hot glue, cardboard, and RC servos. At the time, a great controller for it all was the BASIC Stamp, today it would be an Arduino, RasPi, or ESP8266 - or any number of other options that are all low cost.<p>Still - where Lego (and other building kits) shine is the modularity and standardness of the system. There have been attempts, some fairly successful, to do the same with more robust (mechanically and structurally) parts for kits (makerbeam, vex, actobotics), but they don&#x27;t all have the traction the Lego enjoys from being a near first-mover, and not requiring tools to put together.<p>But if you don&#x27;t mind tools - there are plenty of lower cost options out there (not saying this because people don&#x27;t know it - plenty do)."
comment,14260136,,,1493845916,,giltene,"I&#x27;m in no way arguing that Intel and others do not also contribute to HotSpot. It&#x27;s just that MUCH more attention and seems to be paid to LLVM, and the amount and impact of contributions there are bigger.<p>As to the AVX2 work contributed: there are all sorts of &quot;easier to integrate&quot; AVX2 uses that had been added to HotSpot over time (especially with intrinsics, which tend to be nice and isolated from the rest of the code gen), but the vectorizer in C2 is not nearly as capable as the one in LLVM, and the results speak for themselves. And I expect o see a similar gap open when AVX512 becomes available on Skylake EPs soon.<p>On the &quot;how many contributions directly applicable to Java vs. C++ question&quot;: we were surprised at how readily those &quot;C++ focused things&quot; apply to idiomatic java code. The LLVM contributions can probably be better describes as &quot;expecting certain patterns and idioms that are common in C&#x2F;C++&quot;. And once you bring the Java code to LLVM IR form and &quot;remove the breaks&quot; as much as possible (e.g. fix how things like safepoints, GC barriers, and depot points used to defeat most optimizations), the patterns seem to be there in the Java code as well. The vectorization u-bench thing here is certainly a good example of that in play. We didn&#x27;t massage it to find the vectorization opportunity. I didn&#x27;t even get specific directions or tips on &quot;write it this way&quot;. I just wrote some &quot;I <i>think</i> this loop should be vectorizeable with AVX2&quot; pieces of java code and the existing vectorizer seemed to have just picked them up and had its way with them."

comment,14260082,,,1493845545,,klodolph,"&gt; In duck-typed like Ruby&#x2F;Python, you don&#x27;t necessarily know whether a piece of code is going to fail, so you assume it does. That&#x27;s why you have try&#x2F;catch blocks all over the place.<p>That&#x27;s an unreasonable viewpoint.  Whether you understand what a piece of code does at runtime is down to the particulars of the code far more than it depends on the language you choose, and it&#x27;s nothing but code smell to put try&#x2F;catch everywhere because the code isn&#x27;t doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing.  At best we might agree that it&#x27;s difficult to maintain a high level of code quality in a large Python project, but try&#x2F;catch everywhere won&#x27;t improve things.<p>There are generally two good places to put try&#x2F;catch.  The first is to put try&#x2F;catch around a small piece of code that is expected to throw an exception, like parseInt(), and handle the exception right there.  The second is to put try&#x2F;catch around a piece of work which is large enough to make a decision about even when you don&#x27;t know why it failed—things like top-level HTTP request handlers in web servers, or individual work items in batch processors where you can decide to skip the item and move on to the next.  In either of these cases, you&#x27;re using exceptions to alter control flow.<p>That&#x27;s the same way it works in Python, Java, C++, C#, and so many others.  And Go uses the same principle, too, even though Go uses error returns.  Which is why I am still confused about your original comment—since Go does not have exceptions.  Go literally just has panic() and return."

So that&#x27;s another $79.<p>The Vive already has an accessory ecosystem as companies are more willing to invest in the more &#x27;open&#x27; system. You can buy a thinner cable, various comfort gaskets, a complete wireless solution (only in China for now), non-controller trackers to attach to your body or objects in your playspace (still mostly devs doing this), a foveated rendering plugin (just anounced), etc.<p>You get a slightly wider FOV and a lot more room if you wear glasses.  Also a built-in camera, which is a little gimmicky, but a godsend if you want to move a chair, read a text message, move the cat, etc without taking your headset off.<p>You&#x27;re also supporting Valve and SteamVR which does not engage in the dirty business of exclusives or &quot;walled garden&quot; approaches like the Facebook&#x2F;Oculus model. There are also privacy issue with the Oculus software. Even when its not running it has a encrypted connection to Facebook&#x27;s server constantly.<p>Lastly, it seems to be the dev favorite. A few of the betas I&#x27;ve been involved with have been Vive-only.<p>That said, the Vive needs a price cut. It occasionally gets $100 off. I&#x27;m hoping they make that permanent."

comment,14260028,,,1493845186,,rayiner,"Advertising is often coercive, designed to manipulate people into buying things they don&#x27;t need&#x2F;overpaying for things. <i>E.g.</i> brand advertising is why people pay $150 for a $10-pair of jeans made in Vietnam. Children&#x27;s brains aren&#x27;t fully developed, which makes them uniquely susceptible to manipulation via advertising. At the same time, they have no conceivable need to learn about different products, because almost none are direct participants in the economy.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to categorically ban advertising in a free society, but at least in the U.S. speech that does nothing more than propose a commercial transaction is subject to lower First Amendment protections, and the combination of harmful effects on children and the lack of any benefit probably get you over the First Amendment hump in that specific scenario."

comment,14259893,,,1493844353,,derriz,"Being introduced to Miranda was a revelation to me back in the day.  I still prefer aspects of Miranda syntax over Haskell.  For example, the formatting of guards in Miranda:<p><pre><code>  gcd a b = gcd (a-b) b, if a&gt;b
          = gcd a (b-a), if a&lt;b
          = a,           if a=b
</code></pre>
versus Haskell<p><pre><code>  gcd a b | a&gt;b  = gcd (a-b) b
          | a&lt;b  = gcd a (b-a)
          | a==b = a
</code></pre>
I know it&#x27;s a small thing and you can get used to such differences but since FP became just an occasional side interest for me, I never made the switch as a heavyish Miranda user to Haskell.  For a long time even getting a Haskell compiler to run was a massive pain.<p>So I started using Mark Jones&#x27; Gofer[1] interpreter which was trivial to build and still is 20 years later assuming you can find the source tar ball.  It kept the nicer syntax of Miranda and added most of the power features of Haskell.  I particularly liked the generalized list comprehension feature which really should have made it into Haskell; things like combinator parser code reads beautifully with it.<p>I know it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re used to but Haskell code always looks ugly to me in comparison to Miranda or Gofer.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gofer_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gofer_(programming_language)</a>"

That shift is going to happen though. Seniors are not a cohort you can ignore. They vote like clockwork.<p>&gt; I think you underestimate how much taxes will need to raise to cover these liabilities. The federal government already has its hands full with SS + Medicare commitments it can&#x27;t handle.<p>I don&#x27;t, but we should&#x27;ve been setting aside these funds. We didn&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ll still need to pay out even at a reduced benefits level.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d rather see failures and bankruptcies at a local level, which will maybe convince other municipalities to reform before they collapse. I don&#x27;t want everything centralized into one giant US federal government default. That&#x27;s not a better plan.<p>Reform will not happen. That&#x27;s code for &quot;cutting benefits&quot;. As long as the US government maintains the ability to tax, it will not default. Social Security keeps a third of seniors out of poverty. 45 percent of Puerto Rican&#x27;s are already in poverty. Cutting benefits further? That&#x27;s not tenable.<p>No one held government accountable over the last several decades, and now we&#x27;re stuck with the fallout.<p>EDIT: Because of ye olde&#x27; HN throttling limits:<p>Most seniors don&#x27;t pay taxes, due to marginal tax rates. Seniors will vote all day to keep their benefits intact. I don&#x27;t blame them."

comment,14259620,,,1493842595,,apostacy,"What I&#x27;ve found, is that every virtual credit card provider has to try to process recurring payments, even if that virtual credit card is depleted, kind of defeating a big use of virtual credit cards. I am sure that this is something they were obligated to do by other financial institutions. So virtual credit cards just end up being solely for online transactions that are not recurring.<p>The only company I have found that actually does what I&#x27;m describing is entropay.com, and they are based in Malta and I don&#x27;t trust them for big transactions, as they have been known to steal people&#x27;s money."
comment,14259617,,,1493842571,,misterbowfinger,"They do much more than just alter control flow - they add to the stack, and are used to debug issue or bonk out of your program entirely. In duck-typed like Ruby&#x2F;Python, you don&#x27;t necessarily know whether a piece of code is going to fail, so you assume it does. That&#x27;s why you have try&#x2F;catch blocks all over the place.<p>In statically-typed languages like Java, you should be able to infer, mostly, what your program is doing at runtime, and if it&#x27;s doing something you&#x27;re expected, you raise an exception&#x2F;error so that you stop processing whatever you&#x27;re processing."
comment,14259614,,,1493842541,,conistonwater,"I agree with your first comment, but for the second: I think that means that high earnings multiples and elevated risk would normally result in returns lower than, rather than in line with, the average. So he expected what he thought would be the consequence of overvalued markets, but got averages instead.<p>Outside the context of this bet, there&#x27;s quite a lot out there on whether unusually high multiples (I think the really popular one for discussions is Shiller&#x27;s CAPE) do or do not predict returns, or whether they predict anything at all. The opinions usually range from &quot;the market says this is the right price for this risk, so it must be right&quot; to &quot;we&#x27;re going to crash&quot;, but it&#x27;s not all that clear who&#x27;s right. (I think Shiller&#x27;s right about overvaluation—I&#x27;m not sure what Buffett thinks.) But it&#x27;s a pretty old topic, so that one is definitely not something he made up just as an excuse."

comment,14259572,,,1493842282,,astrocat,"Justice Thomas is essentially arguing that the 14th Amendment (the &quot;no depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law&quot; one) is the wrong reason to give the person a refund of their fees after an overturned conviction.<p>Reading the dissent, it basically says: when the person was convicted, they paid their fine, and at that point the fine money is now property of the state.  The overturning of the original conviction doesn&#x27;t, however, mean that the fine money also reverts ownership - he claims it is still in ownership by the state so the person cannot claim it is their property being deprived without due process under the 14th amendment.<p>He proposes that the &quot;correct&quot; way to get the money back is by invoking this other thing called &quot;The Exoneration Act,&quot; NOT the 14th.  The problem is the Exoneration Act isn&#x27;t a law that says the state HAS to return funds, it&#x27;s more of a specific appeal process for people to apply to get funds back.  In other words, he recognizes there is no state law in Colorado that requires refunding these fees (nor does he offer a viable Federal one), but he claims there is a process available, at least.<p>In that sense, his dissent isn&#x27;t really about him believing these people are NOT owed a refund in the moral sense of what is just, he&#x27;s simply arguing that the court should not establish that refunds of costs&#x2F;fines in cases where convictions are overturned is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.  It&#x27;s kind of a pedantic dissent.  And I still don&#x27;t agree with him :)"

comment,14259518,,,1493841940,,apostacy,"I use entropay.com, which lets you create virtual credit cards, and pre-charge them. And if the account runs out of money, the transaction is declined, and the merchant has no way to get your money after that.<p>As a warning, there are some problems with entropay.com though. Over the last year, some merchants have been able to detect that entropay.com virtual credit cards are prepaid, and require a plastic card. Also, entropy cards are from Malta, so companies like Spotify or Netflix will only give you access to content licensed there. Finally, and most importantly, entropay.com has a tendency to &quot;float&quot; your money, and I&#x27;ve heard that sometimes they just snatch it. I&#x27;ve never dealt with more than $150 at a time.<p>Since they are based in Malta, I think it would be very hard to dispute anything with them. But if you have to do any bigger transactions, you should use a bank here anyway. But it&#x27;s great for trying out services where you don&#x27;t trust them, or are just concerned with overages. I use them as a buffer for a lot of recurring payments.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some services on hackernews that offer virtual credit cards, but the problem is, that they all are tied to some underlying checking account, and even if the prepaid balance is declined, the company is obligated to somehow collect the money, if they can. There&#x27;s no way to simply cancel a recurring payment. I&#x27;m sure that this is because they are required to by banks in the US.<p>I really wanted to have a complex money firewall, like you describe, but in practice, I&#x27;ve ended up just using plain old credit cards for most things. It is still very good to have an entropay account, though."

And when I told them I am already a verizon customer, they had to re-run it and found that it will actually be $119.99 for the first year, $129.99 for the second year on a 2 year contract.<p>And that&#x27;s before I even get the bill which in my experience with verizon is often 10% larger than the quoted price with internet only (and when I had phone+internet+tv it was almost double the quoted price after taxes, fees, expired discounts, required equipment rentals, and other bullshit)."

They make it extremely difficult to the novice user so much so I wonder if they just give up in frustration. Edge doesn&#x27;t provide you with a default list of search engines like the major browsers do. Instead you&#x27;re supposed to navigate to the search engine web page and then drill down to ADVANCED settings and make the search engine web page you&#x27;re on the default search engine. I wonder how many psychologists they employed to come up with this anti user experience behavior in order to easily prevent the user from simply changing the search engine to what they really want.<p>Additionally, the option to change search engines in Chrome is one click away in Settings.

comment,14259482,,,1493841736,,pcwalton,"V8, like all tiered JITs, doesn&#x27;t do many optimizations unless the code to be optimized is hot. This is the right thing for V8 to do, because most code on the Web is cold and so it&#x27;s better to just run the code rather than sitting there optimizing it. But it does mean that there are a lot of optimizations that would be profitable to perform in the aggregate that are nevertheless unprofitable to do at runtime, because the time spent to optimize outweighs the running time of the unoptimized code. AOT optimizers like Prepack can solve this dilemma, by doing expensive optimizations ahead of time so that doing them won&#x27;t eat into the runtime of the program."

Should they not carry bats to the ballpark because of stats?<p>Should the society stop the game from happening, outlawing it but declaring winner at the same time, because of stats?<p>That is the equivalent of society banning guns from citizens.

comment,14259368,,,1493840962,,blanket_the_cat,"Let me rephrase that; Skipping reindexing punch cards: If your adversary can write some ASM to get the EIP to point to a malicious instruction, they can instruct your system to do something you don&#x27;t necessarily want it to do. Then our homies at bell labs built C, as a layer of abstraction to ASM. With C, your adversary has several ways to accomplish getting the EIP to his malicious instruction. Then, over the years, many brilliant, incredible minds, (no sarcasm about that. None.) have built abstractions to simplify C, and then built abstractions on top of those abstractions, and then abstractions to simplify those abstractions. (I&#x27;m totally not even going to touch networking protocols) There is decades, of building systems with flaws, on top of systems with security flaws, (which admittedly wasn&#x27;t as much of a concern to anyone, as providing the functionality to accomplish objectives, business and otherwise) ... literally, like over half a century of this. So then these middle-management suits, operating with &quot;LEAN 6-Sigma&quot; misconceptions about the nature of the world, expect a kid, with a degree in anthropology (not knocking the study) to run through a 12-week intensive program, and be able to write code for a production system, with perhaps 2 people on their dev team of 8-16, and 3 folks in devops&#x2F;IT who understand security to be able to proof all of that code, and make sure that your Gibson is bulletproof? It&#x27;s unrealistic. If she wants to hack your Gibson, she&#x27;s going to hack your Gibson. We&#x27;re all going to attempt to stop that, and after we&#x27;ve failed, we will spend days filling out reports, talking to feds, and mitigating the damage. But we&#x27;re continuously building onto a flawed mechanism, with another flawed mechanism. I mean, do you know any civil engineers who would say, &quot;Oh hey this foundation is cracked, let&#x27;s build something that tries to patch those cracks, and when that&#x27;s broken, we&#x27;ll build another level on top of that, and let&#x27;s just obfuscate what&#x27;s really going on underneath everything so that nobody who uses the building realizes it&#x27;s unstable, and just hope it doesn&#x27;t get too windy, or that there is an earthquake.&quot; ? Ipso Facto: When you launch some ransomware, that threatens the software reading a gyroscope to tip over an oil tanker if you aren&#x27;t paid $1,000,000, and try to blame it on some kids who&#x27;s only crime was curiosity, they will find a way to subvert the carefully measured security mechanisms you have put in place, to not only clear their names, and prove beyond the shadow of doubt that it was in fact YOU, who hatched this terrible plot, but also save the environment.<p>Sorry, I should have said that to begin with."

comment,14259347,,,1493840823,,yladiz,"I hate to bring this up whenever I see a Facebook project, but it still warrants saying: the patents clause in this project, like in others including React, is too broad. I really wish they made a &quot;version 3&quot; that limited the scope of the revocation to patents pertaining to the software in question, e.g. Prepack, React, rather than a blanket statement that covers any patent assertion against Facebook. While I suppose the likelihood of this occurring is small, I can imagine a company holding some valid patents, such as something related to VR, that aren&#x27;t related to Prepack that Facebook infringes upon, as well as using a software that Facebook produces like Prepack, sue Facebook for infringement, and then losing the right to use Prepack as a result. From my understanding these kinds of clauses are beneficial overall, but the specific one that Facebook uses is too broad.<p>Tangentially related: what would happen if you did sue Facebook for patent infringement, and continued to use this software?"

To be able to recover swiftly from such a crash, the greek economy would have to switch from a very inflexible and sclerotic one (that it is now) to an adaptible, flexible and liberal one. The demographics of Greece do not support such swift action - greece is aging rapidly and the brain drain has gotten really intense. With regards to trade, greece probably benefits from things  like e.g. the common agricultural policy more than it loses through restrictions. There is little support for grexit, because of a) the rhetoric and FUD from almost all political parties (including the  pro-euro syriza)  and EU and b) because there is not enough consensus on the side of the people to go through what would amount to a revolution."

comment,14259302,,,1493840491,,nostrademons,"These are different situations: the practice of options backdating you linked to refers to the <i>strike price</i> of <i>employee</i> stock options, while the article refers to the <i>vesting date</i> of founder shares in an <i>acquired company</i>.  (If you don&#x27;t understand vesting, it basically means that you don&#x27;t actually receive the shares and gain the ability to sell them until the vesting date occurs.  Typically stock options are granted at hire, but they might vest over a 4-year calendar, with you receiving 1&#x2F;4 of the shares at the 1 year mark and 1&#x2F;48 of the shares each month thereafter.)<p>When a company is acquired, it&#x27;s often structured as a stock swap where all the founders&#x2F;investors&#x2F;employees of the acquisition forfeit their stock in the startup, and in return receive stock in the acquiring company, worth whatever the acquisition price is.  It is common for vesting dates on the acquirer&#x27;s stock to be backdated to the date of employment at the acquisition (which for a founder would be the date of company formation).  If they didn&#x27;t do this, think of how screwed founders &amp; employees would be with every acquisition: you thought you owned $X worth of stock in the company, but actually you own nothing, and you have to work at the acquirer for 4 years to earn back the stock you previously had.  (Oftentimes, there might still be a cliff anyway, where you have to work at the acquirer for 6 months or a year anyway to receive the shares you thought you owned.)"

comment,14259206,,,1493839817,,sandworm101,"A factory won&#x27;t just casually add a degree requirement.  That has implications.  In a union environment this may require a higher pay scale.  If they increase the minimum standards for a current job they may have to retrain people.  There may also be a trickle effect on managers who may too now need degrees.  So whereas a startup may just start requiring degrees to weed out candidates, a large employer like a factory (or government) won&#x27;t do so unless necessary.<p>I&#x27;m just starting that rare job that insists on a &quot;four year degree plus other post-graduate education&quot; but isn&#x27;t specific as to which degrees they want.

  - Extension functions [1].
  - Nullable types (compile-time null checking).

I opted for parts just below the top of the line because I thought that would be the sweet spot. (I opted for a GTX 1070 rather than a 1080 for example). I have had no issues so far, but perhaps over the longer term I&#x27;ll wish I had opted for the top of the line build. That is not the case yet. I see your point about buying for the long term savings rather than needing to upgrade every year. I haven&#x27;t yet had issues with that but that may be true over a longer period of time.<p>Additionally, if you choose to buy a PC prebuilt rather than building it yourself it costs a lot more so your price range becomes more accurate than my estimates. That said if I were to give a cost estimate to someone who wanted to get a PC for VR development I&#x27;d tell them they can build a PC that can run everything for around $1200 USD and it would be completely adequate for development work for at least a year or two. As someone pointed out above that doesn&#x27;t include the headsets, so the whole endeavour is still quite expensive."

comment,14259062,,,1493838714,,itamarst,"It depends on the kind of code you&#x27;re writing, and where it is in its lifecycle.<p>Briefly:<p>* Humans can determine if your code does what it&#x27;s supposed to.<p>* Automated tests can keep your code stable, i.e. make sure it doesn&#x27;t change.<p>If you care about correctness you want manual testing and code review. If you care about stability you want automated testing like unit tests.<p>If you care about both correctness and stability you need both kinds of testing.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve mostly written libraries, where stability is very important, so yes, lots of unit tests.<p>Longer version: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codewithoutrules.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;26&#x2F;why-how-test-software&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codewithoutrules.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;26&#x2F;why-how-test-softwar...</a>"

Are there plans to incorporate Flow definitions as an alternative to the __assumeDataProperty helpers?<p>Edit: Looks like this is targeting compiler output, so Flow types would typically be gone by that stage.

comment,14259023,,,1493838464,,mattnewport,For me there&#x27;s no comparison between the experience of firing a gun or a bow and arrow in VR with hand tracked controls vs in a traditional game with a monitor and a mouse or gamepad. Even virtual target practice with very little &#x27;game&#x27; around it is pretty fun I find.<p>The industry is still figuring out how to create gameplay that takes advantage of VR rather than just porting over gameplay mechanics from traditional games. There are also limitations on how ambitious VR games can get given the current size of the market. There&#x27;s some very compelling experiences starting to appear already though in my opinion.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake to put too much emphasis on the current relatively high cost of hardware as a guide to the future potential of the medium. We know that price will come down and if you compare it in real terms to the cost of early PCs it already looks quite affordable.

If no functions on `window` are called during initialization you could just use `__assumeDataProperty` on all the properties of `window` you access.<p>If you call a function on `window` during initialization you would need to use `__residual` to emit the code into the residual program (assuming the call has no side effects on the heap that need to be seen by other initialization code). This is because otherwise Prepack cannot know how the abstract function would modify the heap (if it is an arbitrary function it could modify the global object for example), so it is not safe to execute."

comment,14258984,,,1493838193,,theseoafs,"What kind of guarantees do you want from your type system?  Strictly speaking the only guarantee that linear types give you is that <i>every single</i> linear value will be consumed at some point, which generally means that no resources ever get &quot;leaked&quot;.  If the idea of accidentally leaking a resource is unacceptable to you then you might find that affine types are <i>too</i> flexible, as languages that implement affine types generally give you <i>some</i> way to leak a value.<p>In practice I don&#x27;t know if anyone is overly concerned about this.  While Rust doesn&#x27;t have linear types, I find you have to bend over backwards to introduce a situation where you might accidentally leak a resource.<p>Tarean makes a good point with respect to fusion, but &quot;guaranteeing&quot; fusion requires additional assistance from the compiler in addition to the basic implementation of linear types."

comment,14258906,,,1493837634,,lispm,"&gt; Even if you convince me these two languages are so different, there&#x27;s nothing here to convince me Common Lisp deserves the title of the &quot;real Lisp&quot; or &quot;true Lisp&quot;<p>It&#x27;s the lineage of Lisps where Common Lisp is in, which is Lisp:<p>Lisp I, Lisp 1.5, Standard Lisp, Interlisp, Maclisp, New Implementation of Lisp, ZetaLisp, Spice Lisp, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, ISLisp, ...<p>Those are all compatible to some extent and share a common core. Code moved a lot along these dialects. Macsyma had been written in Maclisp, moved to Zetalisp, then to Common Lisp. Reduce was written in Standard Lisp and then was ported to Common Lisp (without adoption). Hemlock was written in Spice Lisp and moved to Common Lisp. LOOPS was written in Interlisp and then moved to Zetalisp and later Common Lisp. CLOS was written in Common Lisp and was moved to Emacs Lisp and ISLisp. Even much of Common Lisp was moved to Emacs Lisp. ISLisp can be implemented as a package in Common Lisp relatively easily (Kent Pitman did this to check that ISLisp is compatible and has nothing which is not &#x27;easily&#x27; implementable).<p>It was also usual that some Lisp implementations ran multiple Lisp dialects side by side, sharing everything: data, memory, I&#x2F;O, ... For example Interlisp-D had a Common Lisp implementation side-by-side with Interlisp. The Symbolics Lisp Machine ran Zetalisp and four variants of Common Lisp side-by-side.<p>Then there are a lot of derived languages which either have different syntax, different semantics, different data structures, etc.<p>Examples are Logo, MDL, Scheme, Racket, Dylan, ML, Clojure, Javascript and a bunch of other languages.<p>Scheme initially shared some code with Lisp. Dylan tried it with a Lisp transpiler, ML initially was written in Lisp, ...<p>&gt; Scheme can also run LISP code from 1960 with a very small driver.<p>The old Scheme is relatively near the Lisp mainstream, the newer Scheme less and less. Twenty years ago there was some code sharing between Lisp and Scheme, now almost none.<p>For me there are two definitions of Lisp:<p>* the main line compatible and sharing Lisps<p>* the general abstract family of Lisp which share an undefine subset of a set of features: lists, s-expressions, lambdas, parentheses, ... But you can find lots of languages in the larger Lisp family which have only a rough subset of this, like Javascript or Logo."

Any comment that strays from the &quot;party line&quot; is immediately downvoted, usually without response from anyone.  The &quot;silent hand&quot; of disapproval shames into submission or obscurity.  The ideological purity of the community is preserved at all costs--especially at the cost of intellectual diversity.<p>I see comment after comment, ones that are completely reasonable and polite, downvoted into grayness because they disagree with the prevailing opinion.  Instead of posting a reasonable, polite rebuttal--you know, furthering the pursuit of knowledge and understanding--people anonymously click the &quot;I disapprove&quot; button and censor opposing views.  And you and dang don&#x27;t do a thing about it.  The people downvoting comments like that are completely abusing their downvote privilege, but it never stops.  Then you revoke <i>my</i> <i>upvoting</i> privilege after I correctively upvote some unfairly downvoted comments.  Apparently that&#x27;s &quot;working as intended&quot; at Hacker News.<p>Even Slashdot, as far a cry as it is now from its historical golden era, is a bastion of open-mindedness compared to HN.<p>So why should I waste my time here?

Neither actually offer any type of protection against these particular issues.<p>Unless you are wandering around with $20K in cash everyday, your bank account is still subject to the very things you seem to be afraid of. The only thing that changes in a mostly cashless society is your access to your bank account. If the government is going to freeze your account, it matters little if you have a chip card or need to go to the teller.<p>Thankfully, we in the west have moved most of the management of this to the private sector, and require things like warrants before any real action is done.

A loud exhaust can also make you more noticeable to cars, I&#x27;m not going to say loud pipes save lives but in close proximity an exhaust can be the difference between a car noticing you and not.

comment,14258768,,,1493836802,,deepnet,"At least in my case VR simulator sickness was nascent  prioproception.<p>Fast paced and hectic movements performed in VR would make someone sick if performed in real life.<p>Back in the day, playing FPSs with shutter glasses, I realised the motion sensations were tied to the motion. Then the sensations became a feature not a bug.<p>Once I understood the feelings they stopped making me nauseous. VR-prioproception improved my FPS performance. Feeling orientation and velocity really helps.<p>And immersion goes off chart.<p>Hard to know what way one is pointing in space, sometimes  there are scant motion cues.<p>But in VR with prioproception When your stomach jumps into your mouth, pulling insane high-G maneuvers as bolts of laser fire crackle past your ship. With prioproception you sense it, becoming as Tudyk said &quot;a leaf on the wind&quot;. Fully Embodied. No mind, no controls, you just are.<p>My vision for VR is a web browser, informed by Gibson&#x27;s original vision of cyberspace, XEROX Park&#x27;s 3D information sorting and VRML97 with Unreal style portals as hyperlinks.<p>IMHO The VR in Snowcrash was mundane.

comment,14258699,,,1493836339,,mighty_atomic_c,"Banning suicide is as effective as declaring pi as 3 via legislative fiat. At least in my mind.<p>For one, it is hard to enforce; those who choose to end their own lives may not show any signs until the attempt. If they succeed, they cannot be punished. If they fail, what is a &quot;just&quot; punishment? How do you effectively punish someone who wants to die so that after their punishment, they want to live?<p>I guess, philosophically, we do have absolute control of our bodies in practice. Making laws that defy the reality of what humans are is a path to tyranny. If people dont have absolute rights, does the state? There is talk of balancing individual rights against the state, which shallowly encouraging, but to me any system where the individual is not free to not make choices about their body will always be able to justify actions that trade more rights for &quot;security&quot;."

comment,14258684,,,1493836259,,captn3m0,"The basic summary of the situation so far (somewhat simplified) :<p>- Aaadhar is brought in as a national identification system, originally for benefit distribution<p>- The Supreme Court in a judgement on October 2015 notes that there is no legal framework for aadhar and restricts it  to only 3 schemes. It notes that aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for any scheme<p>- The current government rushes the aadhaar act as a money bill (the constitutional validity of which is also being challenged) on 11 mar 2016<p>- Several government departments start issuing gazette notifications making aadhaar mandatory for various schemes (including benefits for AIDS patients, bhopal gas victims, college entrance examinations, birth certificates among others).<p>- The Finance Bill of 2016 passes several amendments to make linking your aadhaar mandatory with your PAN card. Historically, a PAN card was the entity on which you filed your taxes, and with this in place, you cannot file taxes as your PAN card becomes invalid if you don&#x27;t link it.<p>The case being argued today is one that challenges the amendments making aadhaar mandatory.

comment,14258579,,,1493835689,,anigbrowl,"Why doesn&#x27;t Facebook give people a way to have input to their &#x27;community standards&#x27;? Basically it&#x27;s a black box that&#x27;s presumably stuffed with lawyers, marketers, and some analytics people. I see zero evidence that there is any actual input from the people who use FB. It&#x27;s essentially a dictatorship dressed in a costume of democracy, and I would far prefer it if the &#x27;community standards&#x27; were called what they are, &#x27;Rules of Mark&#x27;s Club.&#x27;<p>This is a sore point for me as an artist. It&#x27;s tedious when posts are removed because they depict or seem to depict nudity and you have to go through and assure some anonymous and wholly unaccountable person that they&#x27;re not. One of my friends teaches art history at UCLA and - surprise - he posts lots of fine art on his wall. He has to have 8 or 10 accounts because he is constantly getting temp banned for posting famous paintings of people with no clothes.<p>It also bothers me on a more general level, eg it&#x27;s fine if I take a picture of myself with my shirt off but if one of my female friends does the same thing she risks being restricted from posting or having her account terminated because her breasts are apparently a worse thing than extreme gory graphic violence that comes with a warning but is nevertheless acceptable to post.<p>That&#x27;s sexist bullshit that turns women into second class citizens. I utterly fail to understand how it&#x27;s OK to share pictures of just about any violent subject matter, but any kind of nudity, sexual or not, is grounds for having your account terminated.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of some of the things I&#x27;ve seen on FB over the last year, some with an automatic clickthrough content warning (which is a good idea and mostly well implemented) and some not. As far as I&#x27;m aware none of these have resulted in account terminations for people who posted them:<p>Beheadings (video, multiple examples); hanging; people being shot&#x2F;have been shot; serial killers and their refrigerators stuffed with human meat; disembowelments; autopsy photos. In each of these cases I don&#x27;t mean grimy thumbnails where you can sort of imagine what was going on, but photos and video of sufficient clarity to be used in a news broadcast if not for the disturbing nature of their subject matter.<p>I&#x27;m leaving out other stuff that I found sufficiently disturbing that I prefer not to even describe it. I&#x27;m not into gore, beyond watching a few horror movies in a given year. But I&#x27;m pretty open with my friends list and allow people to join me to groups, so I&#x27;m exposed to a certain amount from trolls and of course there are episodes of violence in the real world that are newsworthy, and I prefer my news without censorship of any kind.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that I&#x27;m not calling for this stuff to be removed or banned from FB. I think the &#x27;graphic content, are you sure?&#x27; warning strikes a sensible balance between protecting people&#x27;s sensibilities and allowing free discussion and information. We live in a world that is often violent and I believe that concealing the ugliness of violence often allows it to proceed unchecked. It&#x27;s also true that some people become obsessed with or celebrate violence, and that admitting it as cultural currency risks desensitization or normalization of violence. Those are tricky questions to which I do not believe any one person, firm, or society has a perfect answer, but given that the instinct of criminal persons and regimes is generally to conceal rather than reveal transgressions, exposure and condemnation is probably a more effective response than obscurity and censorship.<p>After that unpleasant detour into the pits of human awfulness, I <i>really</i> want to hear from someone at Facebook:<p>a) why it&#x27;s OK to engage with the reality of people inflicting horrible violence on others, but it&#x27;s not OK to let people engage with the reality of sexual or aesthetic expression, and<p>b) why the 51% female majority of the population are subject to tighter restrictions than the male minority, and<p>c) why the &#x27;community standards&#x27; don&#x27;t offer any formal mechanism for community input and decision-making.<p>Think about it, Folks. A picture of a healthy naked body is grounds for account suspension or a ban, but it&#x27;s totally OK to show that same body hacked to pieces? That&#x27;s some grade A bullshit, and platitudes about how &#x27;we try to reflect the prevailing standards of society&#x27; isn&#x27;t going to cut it.<p>Automation <i>intensifies</i> whatever process you choose to automate, and if you automate a standard whereby erotic desire and self-expression are constrained but extreme violence and interpersonal aggression are less constrained, guess which you&#x27;ll end up with more of? Likewise if men are allowed freedoms that are systematically withheld from women, guess whose freedoms are going to be expanded and whose are going to be reduced?<p>I demand answers on this. Facebook is one of the most powerful political entities on the planet and those who own it need to explain why, within Facebook, there is greater tolerance for violence than nudity or sexuality, and why one half of the population is subject to greater restrictions than the other half."

They would have to either go through one of the larger delivery companies or not deliver at all due to being blocked.

I found this claim a tiny bit far-fetched, but on the other hand, the amount of false claims the established media kept throwing at him is amazing.<p>I came across ppl who thought Varoufakis as a <i>buffoon</i> like Trump, Boris Johnson, etc. and other political figures who can&#x27;t put two words together.

comment,14258264,,,1493833843,,moron4hire,"Not necessarily. As always, the answer is &quot;it depends&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to get into high-end, room-scale VR with hand-tracked controllers and high-fidelity graphics, then yes. You need a Windows 10 PC with as much RAM, CPU, and GPU as you can muster. Plan on spending at least USD 2000 on a custom-built PC.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to get into smartphone-based AR, you can use practically anything to write the code, and there are plenty of tools to be able to build completely cross-platform apps. But you will want a flagship phone, whether that&#x27;s the latest iPhone or one of the Androids with a powerful CPU and GPU. AR is very <i>CPU</i> intensive. While there have been demonstrations of SLAM on GPUs, all of the implementations I&#x27;m aware of are doing it on the CPU.<p>Where should you start? Well, without hand-tracking of some kind, I don&#x27;t really consider it VR. Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, Samsung Gear VR, and Oculus Rift without the Touch controllers are all glorified 2D interfaces. They don&#x27;t provide anything actually new in terms of being able to interact with the application.<p>Smartphone-based AR apps will probably reach a wider audience sooner than VR. But if Microsoft&#x27;s approach to headsets and Windows Holographic pays off, I think that is not a perpetual state of affairs. Ideally, this gets down to the size of a pair of sunglasses (which is very nearly the case already). At that point, smartphone-based AR is going to be a quaint novelty."

comment,14258255,,,1493833822,,ryanwaggoner,"Everyone is going to have their own opinion and 2 cents about what you should do, so I&#x27;ll add mine to the mix.<p>First of all, most importantly, you&#x27;ll never find a better investment than yourself, up to a point. Whether it&#x27;s education, new skillsets, saving time, starting a new business, etc, you&#x27;re likely the best investment vehicle you have. Don&#x27;t read this too literally, it&#x27;s not a science, but I&#x27;d add it to your thinking. Ask yourself regularly how you can invest in yourself and grow your earnings.<p>Second, related to the above, I think it makes sense to spend a bit of time optimizing and automating your finances (I&#x27;m a fan of &quot;I Will Teach You to Be Rich&quot; by Ramit Sethi, despite the scammy title), but from then on, spend 20% of your energy on keeping expenses low, and 80% on growing your income. You can only cut expenses so far, but income is essentially unbounded.<p>Third, I would spend a lot of time educating yourself on finance and investing. As has already been mentioned here, the &#x2F;r&#x2F;financialindependence subreddit and the Bogleheads forums are both great places to go from here. Read lots of books (both of those places will have recommendations), blogs, listen to podcasts, etc.<p>Fourth, in terms of the stock &#x2F; bond market, I&#x27;d recommend just doing index funds with Vanguard. I could go on and on about the reasons, but basically it comes down to it likely being the best way for you to get the highest returns in the public markets. You can&#x27;t beat the markets in the long run, and almost all the non-index-funds out there can&#x27;t either. Vanguard popularized index funds, they&#x27;re owned by their investors, and they have the lowest cost funds available.<p>Fifth, if you&#x27;re likely to get overwhelmed by options, just do a lifecycle fund to start with. It&#x27;ll handle all your asset allocation and rebalancing for whatever your time horizon is. If you&#x27;re <i>really</i> likely to get bogged down, consider Betterment or Wealthfront. You&#x27;ll pay a bit more in fees, but in return for convenience and a fancy dashboard that makes you feel good :) Better than never getting started!<p>Sixth, I&#x27;m bullish on real estate in good cities with long-term growth, but I&#x27;d recommend you have a decent pile of cash, start slow, and invest for cashflow. Keep in mind that buying investment real estate is just buying a small business. It just so happens that for a bunch of reasons, you can borrow 75% of the purchase at pretty favorable rates, and it&#x27;s lower risk than buying many other types of businesses. It is <i>not</i> passive :) Biggerpockets.com is a great community for learning more about real estate investment.<p>Seventh, going back to the first point, beyond public stocks &#x2F; bond and real estate, you could also look to invest in private companies, either your own, as an angel investor, etc. There are some crowdfunding sites that have popped up recently for doing angel investing in startups, investing in real estate, etc. You can also look at things like Prosper or LendingClub, where you&#x27;re lending money on a marketplace to other individuals. Lots of options.<p>My advice would be to focus your energy on the big three that people have almost <i>always</i> used to build significant wealth: public stocks, real estate investments, and your own business. The others are exciting and interesting and can work, but generally carry a lot more risk.<p>My own (unscientific) approach is to keep them all below 10% of my networth. Same with picking individual stocks, if you&#x27;re into that.<p>Hope that&#x27;s helpful!"

On your farm, you dont have to worry about your boss, your church, your neighbors, the street, the block and that shows.

comment,14258180,,,1493833419,,graystevens,"Security is one of those arts, especially when it comes to the programming side of things, that one tiny chink in your armour is enough. There are people and tools out there which scan continually for the bugs and holes, either wearing a white hat and submitting them to bug bounty programs or similar, or wearing a darker shade of hat and doing much worse.<p>Of course, there are things out there which can help a business to minimise these risks and to try and catch these potential coding horrors before they&#x27;re put in-front of the general public:<p>- Static Code Analysis (sometimes referred to as source code analysis) is sometimes a quick win here, but of course not the silver bullet. Sometimes a bug cannot be easily identified by just looking at code for common mistakes, it takes a skilled eye or even dynamic analysis for it to be spotted. However, static analysis can be added into your production pipeline and workflow, checking on each push for any newly added vulnerabilities!<p>- Automated vulnerability scanning&#x2F;testing is also something else which can be done in-house usually, with the right tools. There is no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t be running various security scanning tools against your application during testing&#x2F;pre-production, such as web application scanners or even fuzzers.<p>- Go external, and get a 3rd party to penetration test your application if it requires that level of scrutiny. There are plenty of smart folks out there who do it day after day who can do this for you.<p>You can also deploy thing post deployment of course (depending on what you are coding!), so for web applications, a WAF (web application firewall) is sometimes useful to stop the vast majority of automated attacks. The alerts from this will also give you a very good idea of what is out there and at what scale you are being targeted.
I&#x27;m currently working on a side project [1] which is to try and identify breaches once they have happened, as unfortunately they are almost inevitable. It isn&#x27;t always your code which lets you down! It may be a dependency or library, or even a simple phishing email. Put simply, my project produces a canary to add to your user base, that we&#x27;ll monitor continually for a number of tell-tail signs that someone else may have a copy of your data.<p>At that point, it&#x27;s time to invoke your incident response process!

I&#x27;m a bit surprised this isn&#x27;t on the front page already.<p>This is such a cool service.<p>I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of knowing Peter (and a decent amount of his team) through their work @ Heroku over the years, and have always been a huge fan of their work. I had dinner with Peter and team a couple of weeks ago, and was 100% psyched to learn that manifold was going to be launching soon.<p>The problem they&#x27;re trying to solve is that purchasing &#x2F; managing subscription services for developers is tricky.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever used a platform like Heroku, it&#x27;s extremely convenient to manage additional developer services because you can easily provision &#x2F; upgrade &#x2F; downgrade &#x2F; remove them using a consistent interface (billing included). But the problem here is that you&#x27;re bound to Heroku specifically.<p>I&#x27;ve often wanted to have a similar place to purchase all my services for apps (and companies) and have them bound to an independent identity: that way I can carry them with me wherever I might need them, and for whatever projects I might have.<p>The other important part of this here (which is where I hope Manifold will be particularly useful) is helping me (a developer) figure out what services to use.<p>The problem I have now is that when I work on applications, I&#x27;ll need to provision Redis. So if I&#x27;m on Amazon I might use ElastiCache, or RedisGreen, or some other provider, but being able to sort through them, compare them, see reviews &#x2F; rankings, etc., is all really important.<p>Anyhow: I&#x27;m really excited!

comment,14258135,,,1493833165,,sjtgraham,"Thanks for the questions:<p>The legal one was looked at by lawyers earlier this year. There were two points to consider:<p>- copyright infringement via reverse engineering<p>- &quot;hacking&quot; statutes, e.g. Computer Misuse Act 1990<p>They concluded that there are no concerns in terms of copyright infringement, we have devised many non-infringing techniques for reverse-engineering and use them wherever possible, not least because they are easier to work with. When it is not possible to use such a technique this is where the exemption kicks in for creating inter-operable systems. FYI &quot;infringement&quot; occurs when transforming a low level language, e.g. machine code, into a high level representation. Computer programs are considered literary works, and their authors enjoy the full protection afforded as such.<p>The hacking statutes are very broad and technically if you used my laptop to access your own email while I was away in the bathroom you would fall foul of computer hacking laws in the UK. They said action via this angle said is a low risk (despite lawyers being conservative by nature). Teller isn&#x27;t actually liable anyway, as it does not &quot;cause&quot; the access, the user does. Can a user accessing their own bank account ever be considered unauthorized? Would a bank prosecute their own customers for doing so? Unlikely, given Yodlee has been able to operate without legal challenge for decades now.<p>In terms of breakage, bank APIs rarely change. Most do not ever. The most aggressively defensive and technically competent bank IMO is Barclays and it takes them months to ship something to mess with me. They also can&#x27;t just simply break something there is a window where both versions are supported where they advise users to upgrade before forcing the matter some releases down the line."

 please .. don&#x27;t start. I sunk 1-2 grand into sets - for me it wasn&#x27;t worth it. The old legos were a lot better. Reusable pieces that make them an investment. The newer sets often have special purpose pieces and instructions to just build 2-3 models. I thought I was learning about mechanical stuff - differential steering, inside of an engine, etc. Frankly, watching Youtube videos is a much more cost effective way of learning. What is the worst thing of it all - artificial scarcity. I&#x27;d buy sets I didn&#x27;t really care for because I was afraid they would go out of stock.

comment,14258072,,,1493832778,,anigbrowl,"First, good luck - it&#x27;s a difficult space and I applaud you for trying something different. I have a few uncorrelated questions:<p>1) Is the API limited to types of transactions or do you host configuration information? For example, I&#x27;ve often wished for a bank account that would look at my outgoings and some criteria that I&#x27;ve set, and then allocate some monies to savings or investments on a percentage basis rather than an absolute number. Are those calculations something I&#x27;d need to do at my end and then send you a bunch of API calls to make the transaction, or would they run as bots on your server? Sorry if that&#x27;s not very clear<p>2) Will you impose tight or narrow restrictions on who can open accounts? For example in the USA many banks require an SSN to open an account and won&#x27;t accept an ITIN (another kind of tax ID sometimes issued to immigrants), placing millions of people outside the banking system and thus making it that much more difficult for them to pay bills etc.<p>3) Will your service have access to the SWIFT network for international transfers or are you subject to restrictions while you prove some sort of banking <i>bona fides</i>? I don&#x27;t know anything about banking relationships in South Africa or so but I&#x27;ve noticed the US is very aggressive about limiting transaction access for anything that looks like it could be remotely connected to crime of any kind, and I have sometimes had the impression that US banks are very &#x27;suspicious&#x27; of anything that might coincidentally pose a threat to their business model.<p>I want to wish you a lot of luck and am very excited to see where this might go. I&#x27;ve never enjoyed dealing with money or finance, and get no more enjoyment out of being paid than I do out of paying bills. Financial chores are about as much fun as cleaning a toilet and the idea of being able to reduce the amount of time spent on dealing with money without putting myself at financial risk sounds heavenly."

comment,14258012,,,1493832544,,itamarst,"While investing is important (personally it&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 stock index fund and US treasuries), another important thing to do is reduce your expenses.<p>1. The lower your expenses the less money you need on an ongoing basis. This means you need less savings to fund your lifestyle.<p>2. The lower your expenses the more money you have left over to save and invest.<p>The combination means you have more money <i>and</i> it lasts longer. This is pretty important career-wise because it makes it much easier to find a better job: when you need to quit or lose your job you have much longer to find a good job, you don&#x27;t need to take the first one you find.<p>Expanded version here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codewithoutrules.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;living-below-your-means&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codewithoutrules.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;living-below-your-me...</a>"

comment,14258006,,,1493832524,,forgotpwtomain,"&gt; In the rest of the dissent, Thomas discusses the due process that was available under Colorado&#x27;s Exoneration Act and indicated that this law did not automatically entitle convicted persons to an automatic refund of any fees associated with their convictions, partially because state law ordered that money to be dispensed via victim compensation funds.<p>&gt; This highlights a potential chilling effect of this ruling. As states are now on the perpetual hook for any monies that may be confiscated from someone who is eventually exonerated (and in the case of white-collar crime, this could be millions of dollars), and since you can&#x27;t know that someone won&#x27;t be exonerated in the future, states who are interested in keeping their budgets balanced will be incentivized to hold such money in escrow instead of dispensing it for victim&#x27;s relief.<p>It seems that Thomas&#x27;s dissent finds its basis in that the defendants should have followed the due process set forth in the Exoneration Act to have a <i>substantive entitlement</i> to the money, on the other hand in Alito&#x27;s concurring opinion he quite explicitly disagrees and posits that the Exoneration Act violates due process:<p><i>These stringent requirements all but guarantee that most 
defendants whose convictions are reversed have no realis
-
tic  opportunity  to  prove  they  are  deserving  of  refunds.
Colorado  has  abandoned  historical  procedures  that  were
more generous to successful appellants and incorporated a 
court’s case-specific equitable judgment.  Instead, Colorado 
has  adopted  a  system  that  is  harsh,  inflexible,  and  pre-
vents  most  defendants  whose  convictions  are  reversed  
from  demonstrating  entitlement  to  a  refund.    Indeed,  the  
Colorado  General  Assembly  made  financial  projections
based  on  the  assumption  that  only  one  person  every  five
years would qualify for a financial award under the Exon-

You might hear from this interview how Varoufakis looked at Greece&#x27;s crisis negotiation-position with the EU: that for Greece, similar to the employee-management structure of Valve, there was a lack of hierarchy between peers and only a room full of equals. In that sense and through the Valve-hierarchy of equals lens, much of the tone-deaf rhetoric of Varoufakis towards his peers though the bailout talks can be interpreted with a wider spectrum of sound.

comment,14257856,,,1493831688,,gregpilling,"Very good comment, thank you.<p>You are exactly correct on the tooling costs, except there is no limit to the high end. Ford might spend many millions on tooling for a new car at the extreme end of the scale, for example. I think all tool and die makers are way to used to saying &quot;$10,000 and up&quot; anytime you ask them about die costs.<p>We often employ ghetto-tools when doing small runs. This means a tool carved out of cheap A36 steel that will only last a few hundred uses, or layers cut out on the laser and stacked up to make functional-but-ugly tool. Tools like this can be made from scrap laying around and some machine time - essentialy free since the costs were already sunk. Its a great way to see if an idea will work, or to make something in small runs of 10 or 50. A $10,000 tooling cost is non-starting if the total sales expected is measured in a few thousand dollars.<p>This is why flexible tools like laser cutters are so popular. No special tooling to buy, the laser does it all. The high price of tool and die making has put most of those shops out of business or moved it offshore to Asia. What little we do for my company we do inhouse now. The problem with a laser is that everything starts to look too much 2D and too boring. &quot;When everything is a hammer ...&quot;<p>Flair.co looks like neat stuff.

comment,14257832,,,1493831565,,frankydp,"The OP may be over the top and on the fear-mongering side of things, but there are some very difficult situations monetarily especially for elderly recipients.  While there is some policy to not completely bankrupt surviving spouses, the reality of a long term care spouse utilizing medicaid is that the surviving spouse must reduce assets to below $2500 with few exceptions or shelters.  That policy will almost guarantee that the surviving spouse if not a homeowner, will be strongly below the poverty line for the rest of their life.  The primary cause of that scenario is the huge gap between enough money to be retired(50k-150k), and the amount of money required to be retired without assistance(350k-500k).  Full time skilled care like a retirement home, can easily cost $7k a month on the low end, with averages around 28months.<p>The OP may be able to make a more widely accepted argument, by more empathetically communicating that medicaid is at best emergency support for crisis, and not a vehicle for long term or widespread medical care.  He is correct that using Medicaid as a primary vehicle for ACA coverage expansion ensures a very large group of people will have huge negative motivations to exit poverty, even more so than were previously.  I would guess that the OP has first hand experience with Medicaid policy completely eliminating a family member&#x27;s entire life&#x27;s monetary worth, which is a hard pill to swallow when someone has paid into Medicaid for decades.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.longtermcarelink.net&#x2F;eldercare&#x2F;nursing_home.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.longtermcarelink.net&#x2F;eldercare&#x2F;nursing_home.htm</a>

People from back east don&#x27;t have a strong a tie to conservation as most of their land isn&#x27;t public land or land they have easy access to.  Most hunting out east, and in Texas, is owning land or knowing someone who owns land.  As you move further west most hunters use public land and they are more inclined to focus on conservation.

(And Washington is a bit weird, as it&#x27;s vastly rural save for a handful of places that attract a lot of out-of-state people, more so than, say, Atlanta, Des Moines, etc).<p>But here&#x27;s one anecdote to demonstrate what I&#x27;m talking about:  My wife grew up in Hampton, VA, and when she was a teenager they painted over the &quot;whites only&quot; signs at the community pool.  The rule hadn&#x27;t been enforced in a long time, but everyone was fine with it being there.  A generation+ was raised with a glaring symbol that some people were considered lesser, and being told that it&#x27;s no big deal.  Her grandmother once wandered a store for 15 mins trying to find a black employee to get something down off a shelf, rather than have any of the white employees do manual labor.   (And yes, my grandparents had a lot of overt racism too...but they learned to tone it down whereas her grandmother didn&#x27;t).  Her father had views that are reprehensible and would sound a bit harsh coming from a KKK member.  The stories about sexism are less horrifying, but far from good.<p>Racism is everywhere, racism is bad.  But if we want to improve things, we can&#x27;t pretend that everyone is equally racist - we need to acknowledge and try to correct.   The reason I have hope for humanity is not that we&#x27;re perfect, or even good, but that we RECOGNIZE these behaviors as bad.  Slavery?  Still happens, including in affluent nations, but we consider it a wrong, which is a necessary first step to getting rid of it.   Ditto racism, sexism, homophobia, etc - the human species has a lot of work to do, but we&#x27;ve made progress.   I don&#x27;t want to lose that because people ignore the higher rates of overt and blatant racism in ANY area by saying &quot;well, it&#x27;s true other places too&quot;.

We’ve been working on this for the past few months and would love your feedback. :) You can use Manifold to buy and manage services like LogDNA, Mailgun, JawsDB, Bonsai, Scout, RedisGreen, and Memcachier. We’re starting small and adding services slowly but eventually we’d like to add many more services and a more integrated developer experience (e.g. a CLI). We are in a very early stage, so we hope it can be of some use to you.<p>We’d love any questions, advice, or thoughts you have on the direction we’re taking. One thing we’re really passionate about is making the sum greater than the parts with our services, and we’d really be curious about whether adding specific types of services or building integrations feels more useful in accomplishing this. Thanks!"

What he said was <i>we won&#x27;t accept any more loans that we can&#x27;t pay back</i> and requested a sort of <i>new deal</i> for Greece which of course, included a large debt haircut.<p>He was never pro-Grexit. He was arguing that even throwing Greece out of the common currency was impossible, etc.<p>I understand that his way of doing things might confuse some people, but if you take the time to read&#x2F;watch his interview his thinking is crystal clear: He wants to change the EU from within not disintegrate it. In fact he is <i>trying</i> to save the EU from itself (e.g. Brussels) by democratising the processes (e.g. add mics and records to Eurogrops, etc.).<p>Plus, I the ECB effectively closed the GR banks he had a plan of putting the ECB (Mario Draghi) against the Bundesbank. His own party kept him down stripping on of his only <i>weapon</i> by re-assuring the ECB behind his back that they&#x27;ll not allowing him to use it. His plan was very clever."

comment,14257595,,,1493830403,,schoen,"I think you&#x27;ve oversimplified the legal situation here. Many states&#x27; laws do allow parents to give their children alcohol, but they may also allow the parents&#x27; practices in this regard to be considered as a factor in finding that they are unfit parents, which is a determination that should be made by a formal hearing, considering various evidence.<p>This may seem kind of bizarre, and perhaps the criteria in many states need to be made clearer and more objective, but it&#x27;s not an inconsistent position. In many contexts the law allows parents to expose their kids to different kinds of risks, but if the overall amount of risk is considered too high, then the parents&#x27; fitness may be questioned. In the alcohol context, a judge might consider that letting children drink at meals in their parents&#x27; presence was not unfit parenting, but knowingly allowing the children to drink every day without any supervision was."

It might not be a lie, but it does a significant disservice to the American people.  The morning after Trump launched the most recent attacks against Syria the top 5 newspapers in the country had 18 stories on it.  Not a single one was an opposition piece.  We found out from Wikileaks that toppling Assad was a plan put in place in 2006 by Israel and Saudi Arabia and is primarily about trade and an oil pipeline.  The plan was to trick Assad into thinking he was being attacked and get him to use chemical weapons so the US could come in and take him out.  The fact that more Americans are knowledgeable about the fact that some brown people got their travel plans interrupted by a stupid EO than they are about the fact that Obama has the blood of a million Syrians on his hands over an oil pipeline is all the evidence you need to know that &quot;real news&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;real.&quot;  That&#x27;s why people are fleeing to all of these &quot;fake&quot; news sources, because we know we&#x27;re being lied to in the &quot;real&quot; news."

comment,14257475,,,1493829800,,achou,"The survey polled 430 &quot;mostly everyday programmers&quot;. Unfortunately, everyday programmers mostly know very little about security.<p>Developers tend to think of security as about avoiding coding mistakes, and that&#x27;s reflected in their idea that security is about pen testing, code review, tools, etc. Any security professional will tell you that these are valuable but only a small part of the big picture. Take a look at Microsoft&#x27;s SDLC for a wider view of what it takes to weave security into every aspect of software development[1]<p>Probably the single most valuable thing most development organizations could do to improve security of applications is to do threat modeling[2][3]. It&#x27;s especially valuable in the early stages of application design, but it can be applied at any time. Threat modeling can increase awareness of how an application&#x27;s security assumptions interact with its overall architecture. Thinking through your application&#x27;s threat model systematically is the first step to prioritizing mitigations.<p>Unfortunately, this is voodoo to most developers even though it really should be an intrinsic part of designing application architecture. I&#x27;ve heard people say there&#x27;s a mental block because the kind of thinking required for security is almost the opposite of that required to design and construct systems. I don&#x27;t believe that though. I think it&#x27;s mostly a matter of training and historical accident that security is even a separate discipline. It shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sdl&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sdl&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msdn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;library&#x2F;ff648644.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msdn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;library&#x2F;ff648644.aspx</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.owasp.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Application_Threat_Modeling"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.owasp.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Application_Threat_Modeling</a>"

comment,14257409,,,1493829459,,resoluteteeth,"Windows S sort of makes sense in various ways:<p>* It can replace the free licensing for cheap tablets which had fairly extreme hardware restrictions so normal laptops couldn&#x27;t use it. These restrictions probably had the unfortunate effect of giving the impression that Windows was unusable on tablets because these devices <i>had</i> to have limited RAM to be eligible.<p>* Now, they can give free or cheap licenses to devices with any specs, but get the payment for a full version later if the users want it. This way they can compete with higher-end chromebooks.<p>* By preventing users who aren&#x27;t tech savvy from installing junk that will clog up their system, they can actually give them a better experience.<p>* They can give developers yet another reason to put their apps in the app store, even if just using their new conversion tool. Maybe there&#x27;s still hope that people will actually use the app store!<p>* Because the upgrade goes right to Pro, rather than Home, for $50, this actually isn&#x27;t a bad deal for individuals who want Pro anyway. Currently I think that&#x27;s actually more than a Home-&gt;Pro upgrade. I imagine they&#x27;ll fix that, but even if either upgrade route is the same price, the OEM cost for the 10 S license should be cheaper or free so, it might be cheaper to buy a 10 S computer and upgrade.<p>Still, from a user&#x27;s perspective, Microsoft locking down the OS and trying to force people into the Windows store doesn&#x27;t seem that reassuring, and if you can&#x27;t use WSL I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use 10 S anyway. I might buy one of these laptops and install linux, though."

It would probably be equal to the typical daytime minus nighttime temperature difference at that time of year and location on the Earth.

comment,14257373,,,1493829251,,thesmallestcat,"It&#x27;s not natural to love or even like your work. Trying to force yourself to do so is perilous. Being burnt out is not a failure. The only fix is to draw back from work in some way. That could be a vacation, it could be not trying so hard at work, it could be finding a new job, it could be finding a new living situation. Combining any of those with new interests, or rekindling old ones, might do the trick. Constantly trying to pep yourself up is not a good idea, you will eventually face catastrophic burnout.<p>The only other option is self-medication. That is only advisable if you truly have no other options but to keep your head to the grindstone, and you will have to deal with the inevitable fallout of self-medication, which ain&#x27;t pretty. So only turn to that as a last resort, like if you&#x27;re compelled (by legal or financial obligations) to continue, where the consequences of stopping outweigh the major drawbacks of self-medication.<p>This is why it&#x27;s so important to achieve a low cost of living and some savings, as it expands your options when you face serious burnout (i.e. you can quit your job without having another one lined up, or take a much lower paying job, etc.)."

comment,14257190,,,1493828461,,YCode,"Small persistent holistic steps in the direction you want your life to move.<p>If you want more money look at where you can save money (not eating out, buying generic products, etc.) and things you might be able to do on the side to earn more.<p>Or if you rather start applying for jobs and seeing what else is out there. You don&#x27;t have to find a job today, just start looking.<p>If you want to have more energy find an exercise routine that works for you and start eating more vegetables and less sugar&#x2F;bread. Take time to meditate or at least relax and clear your head. It&#x27;s likely there&#x27;s something buried in your head that is causing you to be demotivated.<p>If it&#x27;s your perspective that needs tuning work on rewiring your brain. Stuff like replacing &quot;this is hard&quot; with &quot;this will take time&quot; or learning to be okay with being wrong&#x2F;weak and asking for help when you need it.<p>If your work isn&#x27;t fulfilling maybe talk with your co-workers or supervisor to see what can be done to make it better. If that&#x27;s not realistic, maybe your job actually does suck and you need to go back to the first paragraph.<p>For me personally, I find setting aside time to untangle my brain helps the most. Sitting someplace and working on a posture or breathing exercise and really just putting some distance between me and my problems for a little while.<p>Usually after that my problems seem much smaller and more manageable."

comment,14257175,,,1493828410,,rebootthesystem,"Does everyone here understand that the ACA much promoted &quot;twenty-seven million people now have insurance&quot; is a complete farce?  The number keeps expanding, of course, and it is a tragedy of almost unimaginable proportions.<p>OK, with great claims one must offer solid evidence.  No problem, I accept this responsibility.  Thankfully this is a rather easy task.<p>The great majority of these 27 million people are on what&#x27;s known as Medicaid.<p>Is Medicaid health insurance?<p>No, it is not.  Medicaid is a loan.<p>What?<p>Medicaid is a loan from the government.  It is, if one wishes to interpret it this way, no different from taking out a home equity line of credit.<p>In other words, you must repay what you spent.<p>Yes, care you receive under Medicaid must --BY LAW-- be repaid.  And, when your lender is the government the realities of dealing with the worst possible kind of loan shark --one with overwhelming power-- can and do easily surface.<p>Medicaid enrollment as of 2016 reached over 70 million people.  Here&#x27;s the requisite chart:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;245347&#x2F;total-medicaid-enrollment-since-1966&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;245347&#x2F;total-medicaid-en...</a><p>Every single one of these people has, effectively, entered into a promissory note with the government.  They DO NOT have health insurance, they have a loan.<p>And here&#x27;s where it gets ugly:  The State, again, by law, is obligated to seek repayment for services offered and can --and does-- attach your property in the process of doing so.<p>Medicaid is a program that has convinced people they have medical insurance when, in reality, they have a loan.  And this loan can and does cost them their estate as the State automatically becomes the first lien holder once you are on Medicaid.<p>Please don&#x27;t take my word for it.  Here it is from the horse&#x27;s mouth:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicaid.gov&#x2F;medicaid&#x2F;eligibility&#x2F;estate-recovery&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicaid.gov&#x2F;medicaid&#x2F;eligibility&#x2F;estate-recover...</a><p>Here&#x27;s another source with a revelation that should terrify anyone:<p>&quot;if the property is sold while the Medicaid beneficiary is living, not only will the beneficiary cease to be eligible for Medicaid due to the cash from the sale, but the beneficiary would have to satisfy the lien by paying back the state for its coverage of care to date&quot;<p>They should have added &quot;refinanced&quot; to that statement.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elderlawanswers.com&#x2F;medicaids-power-to-recoup-benefits-paid-estate-recovery-and-liens-12018"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elderlawanswers.com&#x2F;medicaids-power-to-recoup-ben...</a><p>Medi-Cal has similar provisions:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhcs.ca.gov&#x2F;services&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;TPLRD_ER_cont.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhcs.ca.gov&#x2F;services&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;TPLRD_ER_cont.aspx</a><p>Another reputable source:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nolo.com&#x2F;legal-encyclopedia&#x2F;how-medicaid-recovers-the-cost-long-term-care-from-your-estate-after-you-die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nolo.com&#x2F;legal-encyclopedia&#x2F;how-medicaid-recovers...</a><p>You might have to pay your parent&#x27;s Medicaid bill:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agingcare.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;medicaid-repayment-of-nursing-home-estate-recovery-150497.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agingcare.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;medicaid-repayment-of-nur...</a><p>More detail from HHS:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;basic-report&#x2F;medicaid-estate-recovery"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;basic-report&#x2F;medicaid-estate-recovery</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;basic-report&#x2F;medicaid-liens"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;basic-report&#x2F;medicaid-liens</a><p>To be clear, estate recovery was not imposed by ACA.  No, this has existed since the very start of the program.<p>What ACA has done is to systematically shove tens of millions of people into Medicaid for, dare I say, political gain.  Nothing less than putting lipstick on a pig.<p>ACA membership numbers look good to the uninformed because tens of millions of people have been hoisted onto Medicaid.  If left unchecked these numbers could easily reach into the hundred million plus range.<p>This is a tragedy. None of these people fully understand that they do not, in fact, have health insurance at all.  They are signing on to a loan, with the loan shark being the government.<p>Think about this for a moment:  This is probably the largest grab of personal property from any government anywhere in the world in the history of humanity.  And all of this property is being grabbed from the poor and lower middle class.<p>Soon one hundred million of our citizens will owe the government everything they possess in order to repay their medical bills.<p>This is theft sold as medical insurance.  When you have real insurance of any kind the insurance company doesn&#x27;t come after your estate to recover their costs.  When you have real insurance the insurance company doesn&#x27;t take a chunk out of the sale of your home while you are alive and, at the same time, kick you out of your insurance policy.<p>Medicaid is NOT insurance, it&#x27;s a dystopian reality nobody is talking about.<p>I think this is absolutely revolting.<p>Why aren&#x27;t the idiots burning down business districts during their &quot;demonstrations&quot; up in arms about this shit?  Right, it requires critical thinking skills.<p>EDIT:  I failed to add something very important here, which is what my position is on how this should work.  I apologize for not making that clear.<p>Medicaid Estate Recovery should NOT be a part of the program.<p>It should NOT exist.<p>We should provide medical care to the needy without ANY recovery requirements whatsoever.<p>If someone needs a million dollars in medical care they should receive it.<p>They should not have to worry about being on the hook to repay it in any way.<p>That is what a decent and compassionate society does and how it behaves, not by sinking it&#x27;s hooks into people who have no choice but to sign on the dotted line.<p>If this estate recovery business were done by a private insurance company they would be destroyed by both public opinion and brought-up on fraud charges.  We should demand better from our government.  We should demand that estate recovery be completely removed from Medicaid.<p>Hope that clarifies my position."

comment,14257157,,,1493828291,,Tenhundfeld,"Is it true that violence is physical, by definition?<p>It is one definition, but there are other more abstract definitions that mean &quot;an unjust exertion of force or power&quot;, &quot;rough or immoderate vehemence, as of feeling or language&quot;, &quot;damage through distortion&quot;, etc.<p>For example, the phrase &quot;violent scolding&quot; is stuck in my mind from a fairy tale I read as a child, and indeed, if you search Google Books for that phrase, you&#x27;ll see many examples dating back to at least the 1800s, examples that do not mean physical violence.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s some new redefinition of violence to use it more abstractly. I think of it similar to the term abuse. Sure, abuse often means a physical act, but it often means verbal&#x2F;emotional acts."

comment,14257109,,,1493828062,,hasbroslasher,"I really like this point. It&#x27;s easy to say that &quot;Slack solves the problem of centralized team communication&quot; or &quot;eBay and Etsy help everyday people collect money off their trinkets, crafts, or useless old clothes&quot;. But bigger inventions don&#x27;t solve a small, narrowly-defined problem: they totally change the game. You can&#x27;t sum up the impact of the automobile, antiseptic or the internet in a sentence, because these inventions caused a cascade of other inventions that solve other problems.<p>Cars weren&#x27;t released out of the blue by a well-funded startup as a half-baked MVP, they were built off of advances in industrial metallurgy, the invention of the engine, engineering used in trains and boats. Similarly, the internet didn&#x27;t just happen - people first figured out electrical engineering, circuit boards, GUI&#x27;s, COBOL and C++ and a myriad of other languages that made it possible to invent the internet.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this online bank thingie is on that level yet. But for me, these kind of inventions are indicative of the death of institutional finance. The first step in destroying global finance as an institution is to whittle away at where the banks can make profit. Apps like Robin Hood have already helped to decentralize knowledge and participation in the stock market. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have shown at least a proof of concept that you don&#x27;t need central banks to have currency. Money transfer apps like TransferWise eliminate currency conversion profiteering. Now what happens when you make a front-end that can wire all of these ideas together? A cashless society? Maybe."

comment,14257016,,,1493827689,,dracht,"It again shows that the oft repeated &quot;men benefit from feminism too&quot;-phrase is nothing but a weak ploy. The vilification of men is complete; sex is violence against women and male traits are &quot;toxic&quot;. Clearly there is something wrong when dudes resort to life size dolls to satisfy their basic biological needs. The cowardly thing to do is to ridicule and lambaste the hopeless for being desperate, to refuse to consider that perhaps your mentality and snarky blog posts are part of the problem."

comment,14256950,,,1493827349,,dmritard96,"In many cases, there simply aren&#x27;t many good alternatives.  I&#x27;ll illustrate with our (flair.co&#x27;s) example. FYI we are a hw&#x2F;sw play.<p>Why Not KS&#x2F;Indiegogo
We are building a product that has a large b2b angle and while the b2c angle is perhaps substantial enough that Kickstarter and Indiegogo could work, they have big enough draw backs that we decided to forgo.  Specifically, it forces you to share your idea (AND its popularity which is more important) publicly. This is bad because 1) right now successful campaigns are immediately cloned since the market has been proven publicly before you even ship and 2) because it forces you signal the b2b viability via the early adopter b2c channel which of course makes zero sense but most investors don&#x27;t think that hard... Thats not to say we couldn&#x27;t do it or even that we shouldn&#x27;t do it, but rather that if we didn&#x27;t have to we didn&#x27;t want to.  There are other advantages to preorders on our own site, namely, the ability send traffic our way instead of staying on KS which ultimately plays well for your SEO and also the ability to iterate on your pitch over time.  Kickstarter is a very all or nothing proposition but if you are convinced that you have a large market, opportunity, and inevitable product market fit, why take the risk on kickstarter if you don&#x27;t need to.<p>Costs<p>There is of course the people time.  If you are wealthy or have a ton saved then maybe you can work for free for 6-12 months but we weren&#x27;t&#x2F;aren&#x27;t.  If you can build your entire product in 6-12 months with 0 money, you also have to wonder if this is something that is simply too easy to make and thus has no moat unless you have some sort of other advantage (former employer that has promised to be your first big customer, key network in the industry&#x2F;space, etc.).  So there are people costs that need to get paid from somewhere and its also worth noting that when you start working on your company, you don&#x27;t have a preorder campaign ready to go day 0 - you will need time to develop at least some aspects of the product and hopefully have tested that its physical incarnation&#x2F;features&#x2F;etc make sense before you decide to start committing to making and selling it.<p>If you make hardware and software there are some costs around initial prototyping (lightweight or maybe even free hosting, small print or prototyping jobs etc.)  These will be in the thousands and likely 10s of thousands if you are iterating over 6 to 12 months.  Especially if you need to make some pilot units and send them to people for testing.  Now I&#x27;m sure some of you are thinking - but I can just 3D print an enclosure and make a cheap pcb for nothing.  The answer is maybe at best.  I would argue the age of simple little sensors in plastic boxes has come and gone for getting a new connected hw company off the ground. Also, how many of the companies that you have seen&#x2F;heard of have done this successfully past the first 3 months?  I&#x27;m sure there is some anecdata out there but most quickly move on to higher fidelity techniques (CNC or SLA at least) and those begin to get pricey.  And you need to buy and ship all those components.  If you are buying in the states its, mouser&#x2F;digikey which means $.  If its Shenzhen, well, unless you live there you still are spending to fly and live somewhere so its not really free but the cost of the components is at least considerably cheaper.<p>Tools are the next big hurdle.  Depending upon your product size&#x2F;materials&#x2F;etc, you are likely to pay between 10k and 200K for tools (variance here can be quite high).  Don&#x27;t forget, the designs for these processes need to be very carefully modeled before hand for moldability&#x2F;formability and this is nontrivial to do if you are an EECS type person.  Even your mech-e if you have one may or may not be qualified to do this well so it may cost time or money to get this done.  Also, its worth noting that this assumes your mechanical design doesn&#x27;t have too many moving parts otherwise you need a lot of testing at the pretooling stage with all of your draft angles etc in place.  Also, tools can take between 2 and 6 months in our experience and even after the tool is finished, you will spend plenty of time testing different plastic forms, verifying your powder coater isn&#x27;t shipping something toxic&#x2F;unallowable etc.  Getting rid of sink&#x2F;flow&#x2F;flash literally can mean a new tool if you have complex&#x2F;unbalanced shapes and that means time&#x2F;money.  Tools are literally set in stone so the changes you can make are rather limited.<p>Inventory<p>So lets assume magically, you were able to do all those things above without any VC&#x2F;Angel money.  Now you need to make units.  So you have a few thousand preorders maybe.  Great.  If you have a large CM, MOQ (minimum order quantity) is often 5K so you are on the hook for paying off the rest.  If you can get good credit with your CM, thats great, but also unlikely on your first run unless you have worked with them in the past.  What about bank loans?  Banks will do nothing for you.  They want collateralized loans so they will loan money to a likely to fail restaurant because they can sell the stoves&#x2F;ovens&#x2F;chairs etc to he next likely to fail restaurant that will move in.  Same goes for xyz you name it non &#x27;startup&#x27; businesses.  We sell smart vents as an example - so if the bank funds the inventory and you can&#x27;t sell it, they aren&#x27;t going to be able to sell it either.    So no banks.  Even with a sales agreement in hand, you are likely not going to get the bank to fund you unless its from a brand&#x2F;company that is well known (Big Box store maybe).<p>So what does that mean?  It means, many of these things are precisely what Venture money is there to solve.  Riskier bets than banks are willing to take but with a higher upside.  If you had the money in hand already, this is a different discussion but for the many hungry first time founders, this is one of the only ways to get your product to market.  What you do after getting to market is almost an entirely different angle.  Post getting the product to market, you may want to keep the company small&#x2F;nimble&#x2F;innovative and your investors won&#x27;t care about that as much as growth since thats how they make their living.  But for that early stage, there aren&#x27;t really substitutes from what I have been able to surmise."

comment,14256890,,,1493827056,,Jtsummers,"Concurrency:<p>I know this can be put in via libraries, but it&#x27;s so much easier when it&#x27;s part of the language (or a language that&#x27;s sufficiently expressive&#x2F;flexible to allow it to not look bolted on). Actors, CSP, I don&#x27;t care. The designs that fall out of using concurrency versus interleaving the logic are just better. They&#x27;re often simpler, more likely to be correct, often delivering more reusable components. Erlang and Go being two modern exemplars of this, though utilizing different mechanisms.<p>Bit syntax:<p>Erlang&#x27;s bit syntax, paired with binary comprehensions (like list comprehensions but over binary blobs), make a lot of my tasks (at least for prototyping since my employers won&#x27;t use Erlang in final products) a lot easier. It&#x27;s clean, paired with Erlang&#x27;s unification&#x2F;destructuring bind version of assignment to variables.<p>Pattern matching:<p>Remove all those if&#x2F;else&#x2F;if blocks, switch&#x2F;case (or make them more effective) statements. Move a lot of decision points closer to where they actually need to be made (in function dispatch). Paired with static typing, this can also be used to enforce things like that functions are total functions.<p>Expressive type systems:<p>Ada, Pascal, Haskell, MLs in general. There are other languages that do a decent job, but these do it best. This allows you to spend time specifying your system, and then describe the system via your types. I&#x27;m not passing around an array of 4 bytes, I&#x27;m passing around an IP address. In Ada, I&#x27;m not passing around an integer, and if you do get smarter and name it something like &quot;MessageIdentifier&quot; it&#x27;s not <i>just</i> an alias for Integer. You can constrain it to only hold values 0-15. You can make a type modular so that it correctly rolls over to 0, rather than indicating an error when you add 1 to the max value. This can be enforced (largely) at compile time, with some runtime checks. Via testing you can mitigate the need for the runtime checks and remove them if you want improved performance. But you have a smaller surface for runtime errors which greatly reduces burden on testing.<p>(Nearly) everything is an expression, few statements:<p>See lisps, erlang, really most functional languages. I find that this fits my mode of thinking and writing code much better. It can allow for some greater concision in code, though also potential for some really terrible looking constructs as well. Everything I write should have a return value of some sort. Even if expressions, switch&#x2F;case blocks. Even if I choose to ignore it or put it into a throwaway variable like _."

comment,14256740,,,1493826286,,Mathnerd314,"&gt; In all cases however, the program without the goto statements turned out to shorter and more lucid<p>This was with ALGOL though; Haskell uses lambdas and is shorter still. I feel like Scheme &#x2F; callcc might be even shorter. And the difference between callcc and goto is not at all clear.<p>To be fair, though, he does mention the human-computer interface. Unfortunately this has still not really been explored in the context of programming. There are toy environments like Light Table etc., and the more developed languages come with IDEs, but nobody seems to use them in practice, preferring vim or emacs or whatever.<p>My guess for this is that writing GUIs in an extensible, modular, and discoverable&#x2F;usable way is still an open problem. There are style guidelines, e.g. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smashingmagazine.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;06&#x2F;designing-modular-ui-systems-via-style-guide-driven-development&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smashingmagazine.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;06&#x2F;designing-modular-u...</a>, but those aren&#x27;t code and don&#x27;t fit into an Agile-style incremental development model. The only thing that seems usable are constraint layouts, e.g. <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;4483218&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;4483218&#x2F;</a>. But those don&#x27;t account for all the little UI things, like the efficiency of the interface or which actions are most commonly used. IMO there needs to be some library to just take a bunch of actions&#x2F;verbs (e.g. Copy to clipboard) and nouns (displayable data stuctures: images, documents, etc.) and turn that into an optimized user interface design, with keybindings, menus, toolbars, dialogs, widgets, etc. And then of course there&#x27;s the issue that picking a GUI pretty much fixes your choice of programming language, away from any of the functional PL&#x27;s."

comment,14256707,,,1493826177,,therpe1,"The idea that every economy can be hyper-competitive is absurd. There are winners and losers, those who produce surplus and those who produce deficits. The question is what to do with the &quot;losers&quot;?<p>Look at America. The American economy is <i>not</i> competitive. It is <i>not</i> efficient and there is no <i>plan</i>. What you have are a few faboulously wealthy and productive economies (the wealthiest and most productive economies the planet has ever known) and a <i>lot</i> of very uncompetitive localities. What ties it all together and makes it &quot;work&quot; is a surprisingly efficient but very opaque transfer union[1] which is, for purely legacy reasons, called the federal government and controlled by the largely un-educated legislative. Seriously, look at the numbers. Transfer payments to what is generously called &quot;non-metro America&quot; constitute 20-25% of income in some counties.<p>So ultimately Varoufakis was right. He understood -- despite being an economist, this is just plain old common sense -- that a Euro-dependent Greece is always going to suffer mightily against Germany. No amount of tinkering or restructuring the economy is going to fix this. The only &quot;plan&quot; was to play chicken with the Germans and potentially let Greece crash but at least take the euro with it. (This only works because, as indicated in the article, everybody was loathe to &quot;force&quot; Greece out of the union. It&#x27;s not even clear whether this is legally possible.) Thus there was in fact a lot of money to be made watching Greece and the euro burn for a while there. Eventually order was restored but only at great pain to all parties and that order is hardly going to be lasting or stable. Such is politics. In the end while it looks like Varoufakis may have been doing nothing... he probably got Greece a much better deal than they deserved in the minds of the Germans. And the next time Greece needs a bail-out -- and it&#x27;ll happen soon because Greece is literally shrinking as everybody who can flees -- the same game of chicken will need to be played and they&#x27;ll need to find an outsider like Varoufakis to play it and take the fall.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transfer_payment"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transfer_payment</a>

comment,14256686,,,1493826069,,dlwdlw,"I think to understand gender discrimination we need to understand what hazing is all about. A basic definition may be &quot;An unpleasant experience to gate access&quot;. At first, I thought it was about building bonds but what I believe hazing actually does is solidify the boundary between in-group and out-group via a specific and unique obstacle.<p>The enphasis of this boundary creates a space for privileged information amongst the network. those internal to the network have access to resources others do not, most often in the form of people and the information in their head. The actual quality of information amongst groups is probably roughly the same, but with in-network information, there is more willingness to be open about this information. This is because information can be infinitely duplicated. Giving out information reduces your competitive advantage just as teaching someone everything you know would as well.<p>Take away the concept of groups and you remove overt hazing. However, individuals exist along with their gated information. This information includes their deepest secrets and fears, their de-facto model of the organization, as well as the secrets to their strengths. Regarding this last one, if you have a high enough gated privilege, he may just give you a link to the resource he used. If you don&#x27;t, he may just try and explain it himself. And if you have low privilege, he&#x27;ll be too busy.<p>Most organizational skills are NOT generic skills learned in school. They are often tips about organizational management, who to ask about what as well as the hidden mental models that keep the legacy code running.<p>Take this potential acenario: If a women asks a man how the fuck the shitty legacy code works, there is a threat. The woman who is fresh from school has some ivory tower ideas and the man is threatened because he knew he took some shortcuts. This manifests itself as arrogance when explaining, perhaps even just telling the woman to just figure it out as some sort of hazing test. One she is jaded enough by organizational existence will no longer be a threat.<p>So there is a constant dynamic of men needing to orove themselves to other men and women. When women are involved, the need is higher, creating more arrogance and a higher power distance. Many woman know this, which is why they are more likely to say: &quot;I heard you were the expert in this area, could you give me a few pointers? I&#x27;m SOOO bad at this stuff. &quot; while other men might &quot;What the fuck is this shit?!&quot;<p>Men basically have 2 choices to extract information. Playing the mentee, or playing a high status individual that the other person has to prove themselves to. Women often only have the first because culturally they are socially punished for aggressive behavior.<p>One root cultural stem is that a man mist be in some eay superior to a woman to &quot;deserve&quot; her. Gender roles have the man playing the hero. This imperative prevents men seeking help from women but also systematically prevents women from reaching high status without overt and obvious superiority in an aspect.<p>This last part is very important. The issue is NOT about actual skill. Out society is set up fairly well in that it is still mostly a meritocracy. The best rise to the top, and this includes women.<p>The issue is that your ability is determined by your access to experience and attitudes. (No longer knowledge, e.g. Blacks being banned from libraries or similar) This can create a headwind or tailwind for you in different directions.<p>Also, in places where measuring skill is flawed and has huge variance, women often have to doubly prove themselves because their &quot;scores&quot; are artificially deflated while an extroverted tall white males might be inflated. From an organizational standpoint this is in some ways even &quot;good&quot; because the org may bot be sexist, but it sure as hell wants its ICs to fall in line. That entails a manager or leader that can utilize aggression and status.<p>So, to sum up, culturally women are often forced to play a low status role, and men are forced into high status and often more high pressure roles. From a romantic but somewhat chauvanistic view, this is &quot;protecting our daughters and wives&quot;. In reality, you fake it till you make it.

comment,14256674,,,1493825999,,virusduck,"Yes and no. Yes in that some of the many billions of combinations of antibody genes can recognize self proteins, which is a problem. However, during maturation of B cells, the immune system has a mechanism for killing of those B cells which would produce anti-self antibodies before they mature. There are times when this fails to work--think Grave&#x27;s Disease, many forms of lupus, alopecia, etc.<p>I think in the sense you are asking, though, is that any long-lived plasma cell or memory B cell that is active will probably not change to the extent that they would attack self.

comment,14256581,,,1493825574,,6d6b73,"There are a lot of similar &quot;long tail&quot; reasons that explain why once cost of electric cars is on par with ice&#x27;s electrification will speed up. 
To add to your &quot;gas station&quot; example, most of these stations make profit not from gasoline but from other stuff they sell like cigarettes, sodas, chips etc. Once the traffic decreases, the profitability will drop substantially so their demise will be faster than if you only consider gasoline sales.<p>My predictions:
- once electric school buses are available parents will push for their quicker adoption so their kids don&#x27;t have to breath in the diesel and its waste products.<p>- since electric cars require less maintenance automotive parts stores and car service centers will be hit. No need to change oil every few k miles. No need change your muffler, transmission fluid etc. This will make ice parts availability to drop and price to increase.<p>- if Tesla is successful with its direct sales other manufacturers will eventually follow. Number of dealerships will drop<p>- some stores like Costco offer gas discounts for their customers. If they see that number of electric cars is increasing they will replace that with free charging spots for the best customers.<p>- electric cars will (presumably) not be required to do emission testing, which in turn will require states to lower number of emission testing centers. After a while it&#x27;s possible that these emission centers will be few and far between, an emission testing will become even bigger annoyance that it already is.<p>- Once number of gas stations starts dropping all of the trucking companies that deliver gas will have harder time making profits. After few of them go bankrupt, gasoline deliver will be more expensive.<p>- Once sales of gasoline substantially decrease, refineries will have more trouble selling their products, so new refineries will not be build. This will again increase price of gasoline but also the price of heating oil.<p>- After electric cars hit 10% of the market, ICEs will be considered a &quot;new smoking&quot;. Peer pressure will keep growing, having an ICE will be uncool.<p>- once oil companies stop being as profitable people on the stock market will start moving their money to other stocks. This will force these companies to stop their dividends, which in turn will make them even less attractive.<p>- states will have to increase taxes on gasoline to make up for the lost revenue. Eventually electric cars will be taxed in some way but before that happens gasoline will become even more expensive.<p>- once oil production is in decline because of decreased demand, countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia will have to deal with huge economic problems that could lead to crash of their economies. This will make access to oil even harder raising the price of gas even more.<p>- electric cars will lower cost of batteries, which in turn will make them a better solution for power tools, lawn mowers etc."

comment,14256524,,,1493825378,,dahart,"&gt; But a &#x27;negative&#x27; way to seem competent is, simply, never to make mistakes.  How much of what we learn to do -- and learn to think -- is of this other variety?<p>Is it an interesting question, but I feel like the words &quot;competent&quot; and &quot;expertise&quot; set up misleading expectations. Most people are experts at walking and eating, but not nuclear physics or the history of Asian music.<p>I guess almost all of what we do at any given moment - look, talk, eat, sleep, walk, read, etc. - is this type. We abstract everything and don&#x27;t consciously process most of what we see &amp; do. Lots of people have speculated that if we were consciously thinking about every sensory input and every action we took, living would be unbearable.<p>But for learning new things, for establishing what it means to be an expert in a new field by being better than others, by doing research, by breaking new ground -- it has to be asked, what good does learned knowledge and not making mistakes serve? What is ever learned if someone doesn&#x27;t make a mistake? Science doesn&#x27;t move without mistakes. Nor does evolution. With competence, there&#x27;s no change.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just coming to the conclusion that being competent and becoming an expert are two completely different things?<p>&gt; Presumably, experts have more effective censors than the rest of us<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure why this is presumed. A lot of us would recognize that someone who&#x27;s made more mistakes and learned from them is more expert than someone who&#x27;s tried nothing new and has only relied on the learned &quot;book knowledge&quot; of mistakes of others.<p>&gt; It annoys me how frequently people suggest that the &#x27;secret&#x27; of making creative machines might lie in providing some sort of random or chaotic kind of search generator. Nonsense!<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more with this, it hits home having spent time practicing digital art.

comment,14256518,,,1493825336,,seattle_spring,"&gt; I was amused to visit Capitol Reef National Park and enjoy a tour of a small canyon where a boardwalk lets you see the names of some 19th century folk carved into a cliff face. Along the way were signs warning you of the criminal prosecution that would result if you carved your own name into the cliff.<p>That boardwalk is called the &quot;Petroglyphs Trail&quot;, and it&#x27;s there for ancient Native American art. Fixing the names of some people that carved their names near it would cause harm to the petroglyphs, so they opted to leave them instead of repair them. I feel like you&#x27;re being intentionally misleading in completely omitting the fact that the boardwalk is there specifically for Anasazi Petroglpyhs.<p>&gt; The abandoned houses across town are blight, but the one in Yosemite is a national treasure.<p>Care to share which house this is? Only information I could find was on the Bodie Ghost town, which is a historic mining town. Again, there&#x27;s obvious cultural significance to an old gold rush town that is not present in some abandoned craftsmen in the inner city.<p>&gt; My child&#x27;s mud hut is a safety hazard, but the one up the cliff is a sacred Anasazi artifact<p>Really? Do you really not see the difference?<p>&gt; On the other hand, I have seen a small local wilderness area turn from a fun spot for a family Easter egg hunt to a regional ATV attraction so crowded the local Boy Scouts could no longer camp there.<p>Which is exactly what a National Monument designation protects.<p>&gt; Balancing the past, present, and future is always a subjective thing. When the BLM actually does its job, it does land management. But that is a hard job. It is often easier to just close everything down and not let anyone in. That is not management. But when pressure on a wilderness grows from a couple hundred visitors a year to a couple hundred visitors a day, a policy of &quot;anything goes&quot; is also not management. Management can be expensive.<p>This is literally the opposite of what National Monument land does. They&#x27;re not &quot;closed down.&quot; They&#x27;re actually far more accessible for generations, just not by way of vehicles that cause massive destruction.<p>&gt; The people in the best position to observe and propose solutions are always local. But BLM struggles to build local partnerships. They try to manage through a multi-layered bureaucracy that ultimately makes decisions from Washington, D.C. The result can often look like the United Airlines video--constructing and enforcing a policy in a manner that doesn&#x27;t fit the local situation. There are any number of ideas that could get the job done cheaper and with more sensibility.<p>Can you cite some sources for that? Let&#x27;s look at Utah, which is at the center of the National Monument controversy. Yuba Lake, a state park, is an absolute disaster of motorhomes, ATVs, and speedboats. Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, Arches and Zion, all federal land, have all maintained a large percentage of their natural beauty and cultural significance. What exactly would the state do better with those lands?<p>Edit: I also want to bring up Goblin Valley, one of the more popular state parks in Utah. It&#x27;s $13 for day-use access to 3500 acres. Grand Staircase, on the other hand, is 1.8 MILLION acres, free day use, and arguably far more fragile and spectacular."

I have no problem with them being given to the states and&#x2F;or sold to private owners.

comment,14256422,,,1493824751,,thaddeusmt,"In Utah, my understanding is that the primary purpose of state owned lands is to generate revenue for the state. Utah uses them to make money, not to protect them. This includes mineral leasing for oil, gas, coal, etc, and grazing, but in some cases, like the &quot;SITLA&quot; School Trust lands, the state will literally auction off land into private hands. This is ostensibly to raise money for public schools. I strongly support public education, but this way of removing beautiful tracts of Utah desert from the public is very final. You can hike around an oil well, and eventually sort of clean them up, but outright selling off limited resources like lands is frustrating. Compared to normal revenue sources, like taxes, these land auctions raise such a small amount for money for the school system it&#x27;s even more tragic.<p>The outdoor recreation industry in Utah is growing rapidly, largely part due to the National Parks, Monuments, and other amazing public lands we have to recreate on. Our 5 national parks (Arches, Canyonlands, Zion, Bryce and Capitol Reef) are some of the most visited in the country. This isn&#x27;t hunting recreation, like the Field &amp; Stream article is about. Most of this is mountain biking, climbing, hiking, rafting, etc. (Think family vacations and young web developers in Vanagons, not gun toting hunters in big trucks.) On top of the burgeoning hospitality industry supporting this tourism, outdoor companies like Backcountry.com, Petzl, Goal Zero, Black Diamond, Altra, Kuhl, Scott, etc have large presences in Utah now. By some counts, outdoor recreation is one of the largest economic drivers in Utah. And between the aspirational outdoor photos people in the city like on Instagram and generally affordable travel, this visitation trend will only continue upward.<p>In response to Utah&#x27;s politicians passing resolutions and endlessly promoting &quot;taking back&quot; Federal land into State hands, the outdoor industry that relies on public land access has started to fight back. To make a stand against these anti-federal politics Patagonia, Black Diamond and some other large retailers threatened to boycott the &quot;Outdoor Retailer&quot; trade show, held in Utah. In response, there was a call with the Governor and he basically gave the outdoor industry the finger. They are moving the trade show to another state now - more symbolic than actually hurtful to Utah&#x27;s economy, but an interesting development nonetheless. After the ceaseless &quot;jobs&quot; and &quot;pro-business&quot; rhetoric from red states like Utah this antagonism towards one of it&#x27;s largest and fastest growing industries is frustrating and puzzling. I can&#x27;t tell if my politicians really see using public lands for finite oil and gas extraction as a better plan than protecting them for generations of future vacationers - or if they just get better campaign contributions from those extraction industries. Either way, as someone who likes mountain biking and who has high hopes for solar energy and electric cars, there is nothing positive to me about these state attempts to control my Federal lands. (I do vote, but I will probably not be able to affect Utah&#x27;s red state politics for a long time.)"
comment,14256419,,,1493824732,,slantyyz,"&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m supposed to get out of this article.<p>I don&#x27;t either.  The tone is incredibly whiny and maybe more than a smidge elitist, in my opinion.<p>My parents came to Canada (from China) in the early 60s, and first rented living spaces in basements of... well, white people. They told me stories of how they wouldn&#x27;t cook any &quot;aromatic&quot; foods like shrimp paste or salted fish, because the smells were deemed offensive. But that was then.<p>Fast forward to 2017, and the acceptance of the &quot;weirder&quot; Chinese foods among North Americans seems to be pretty good, and we can probably thank the Food Network and other TV shows for that. The author&#x27;s complaints about the lack of interest in the finer points of some Chinese cuisines to me isn&#x27;t a big deal. You can just as easily make the argument that people have the same apathy towards Italian food. I&#x27;m sure there are large swaths of people who think good Italian food is what you get at the Olive Garden.<p>I live in a predominantly Chinese suburb in Ontario known to have a lot of good Chinese restaurants (catering primarily to Chinese people). I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of nuance to the food, but a lot of it is lost on me. Most of the popular restaurants are basically cookie cutter clones of the other restaurants.<p>Unlike the writer, I don&#x27;t have a problem with white writers introducing the non-Chinese masses to Chinese cuisine. People want someone like them to introduce them to something exotic to them. My parents for the longest time would only eat Chinese food and &quot;common&quot; western food like McD&#x27;s, steaks and roast beef. My siblings and I would have to do a lot of convincing to get them to eat anything else. Of course, if their Chinese friends suggested something because they tried it and liked it, it would all of a sudden be &quot;Oh I hear XYZ is delicious! We should try it&quot;, even though we may have suggested it a dozen times."

comment,14256350,,,1493824389,,logandavis,"&gt; If we assume that group A and group B have the same average skill level<p>This assumption, on which your argument rests, is invalid.<p>I&#x27;m an engineering college student who&#x27;s had conversations on this subject with admissions officers at my school. The gender ratio of accepted students is much more balanced than the gender ratio of applicants. Every year, the admissions department fields complaints from upset male applicants who were rejected; they feel that they were done a disservice because &quot;the bar was higher&quot; for them than for the female applicants. They point to the different acceptance rates for men and women as proof of this &quot;lower bar&quot; for women.<p>In reality, according to my school&#x27;s admissions officers, the average female applicant is significantly stronger than the average male applicant. There exists, apparently, a huge volume of unqualified male applicants, who inflate that &quot;80%&quot; figure despite having no real chance at earning a position. We&#x27;re talking SAT scores hundreds of points below the typical admitted student, no actual engineering experience, things like that. (I have heard that large companies like Texas Instruments also have this problem, which is why they place restrictions on which specific degrees applicants can have - to filter out that chaff.)<p>These men remain in the applicant pool where women would&#x27;ve washed out, the admissions officers at my school hypothesize, because it is easier for women to &quot;give up&quot; on STEM fields at the first sign of trouble due to social &#x2F; societal pressures. Incompetent men, however, can think they&#x27;re good at STEM more or less forever.<p>A more reasonable conclusion to draw, instead of &quot;Facebook&#x27;s male engineers are more skilled than their female engineers&quot;, would be the one that is <i>presented in the article by the people who have the data</i>. Namely, that this statistic arises from the confounding effect of seniority: Facebook&#x27;s more senior engineers tend to be male, since the drive to hire more women has been more recent, and more senior engineers have code accepted more often."

comment,14256338,,,1493824317,,tedmiston,It seems like speaking and even attending conferences varies a lot by a developer&#x27;s personality type.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan and find it the most effective way to take in info on a large variety of topics I might not otherwise find in a very concentrated period of time.  The networking and whatnot can be useful too.  At PyCon it was neat to meet GvR for instance.  Anecdotally I&#x27;d say maybe 20% of the devs I know pursue conferences regularly.

comment,14256281,,,1493824025,,raesene6,"Unfortunately Security and compliance (like PCI) cover similar ground but are very different in implementation.<p>PCI auditors work to a fixed standard and can be negatively affected if its found that they deviated from it, so there&#x27;s a strong incentive for them to be picky.  When combined with the fact that it&#x27;s hard to have a standard that reflects the reality of good security practice, you end up with well the current PCI process.<p>The problem you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t really (I&#x27;d say) one that came from the IT Security industry though, it was the card issuing companies who set the PCI DSS standard and them that mandated the compliance process.

These small differences lead to huge difference in representation of <i>exceptionally</i> smart people, because of how normal distribution works.  These differences manifest themselves in tasks requiring high intelligence, such as chess, go, engineering and software development.<p>I say this as a scientific statement, with zero sexism implied.

comment,14256188,,,1493823351,,trcollinson,"Maybe what the parent comment said was an over simplification. I would say most startups today go out of business because of poor spending choices, bad oversight be investors and board members, poor management in general (though financial management is the highest among the issues I see), and poor product market fit. Is this because of investment? I would argue yes it is. You learn far better financial practices when you have no cash on hand. Investors and VC&#x27;s honestly aren&#x27;t always the best board members and don&#x27;t always help. Product market fit can be masked by investment money. My comments are all anecdotal however I do work as a consultant for VC&#x27;s who invest in or purchase startups. So there is that.<p>One other area in which people will regret taking investment money if they are not careful is at the time of exit. Many company owners who seek investment money don&#x27;t realize just how quickly they are dilute themselves. While this won&#x27;t put the company out of business, it may put an individual out of the business of running a second startup. It is wise to be careful taking investment money."

I built VMPower because while working at Microsoft with Azure I noticed there really wasn’t an intuitive way to schedule power on&#x2F;off VMs and detect unused ones. It quickly grew into having automations like resizing and taking snapshots as well as detecting basic unused resources.<p>We wanted to keep the following in mind:<p>1) Scheduling VM actions should be easy like dropping events a calendar<p>2) It should be pluggable to any cloud. We work with AWS, GCE and Azure<p>3) Plugging in your cloud subscription should only take 2 minutes<p>Would love to hear what you think!"

comment,14256152,,,1493823111,,geofft,"&gt; <i>As long as Facebook continues to increase the percentage of women it hires, it will have a disproportionately high number of junior female engineers.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand why this follows. The standard argument I hear for why women are under-represented (relative to the null hypothesis) is the &quot;pipeline,&quot; that at various stages in the process women drop out and it is hard to retain them. In particular, there&#x27;s the argument that women put their career on hold for their family, which implies that there&#x27;s a significant number of under-employed <i>senior</i> women.<p>I&#x27;d be very interested to see the number of years of experience vs. level assigned by Facebook, grouped by gender, which would answer whether Facebook&#x27;s gender balance is really the result of a bunch of 0-years-experience hires. It seems very possible that causality here is the other way around: <i>because</i> women get their code rejected more often, <i>therefore</i> they do not get promoted as much."

While such disparities are probably important in some cases, the &quot;why&quot; is generally not addressed in the study outcome, and rather the results are open to all sorts of interpretations based on our biases.<p>And then of course any disparities, properly normalized for alternative factors (or not), have to be corrected. Very messy science. It&#x27;s also easy and politically expedient science - these days we&#x27;re obsessed with inequality, and if you just comb around you&#x27;re bound to find some statistically significant disparities and that gets everyone&#x27;s attention.

comment,14255972,,,1493822043,,drzaiusapelord,"Greece has been cooking the books for a long time, even their entrance into the EU was fradulant. Greece is the blame here via its decades of fraud that finally caught up with it. As a Greek-American with an interest in Greece being successful I think all the finger pointing at Wall Street or Germany is asinine. Greece is horribly corrupt and tax dodging is like its national sport. Its like someone turned Chicago into a country. All of its out of control spending, unsustainable union perks, and unrealistic pensions finally caught up with it, just like its happening in Chicago right now. The difference is Chicago and Illinois can raise taxes and make appropriate cuts over the long term, but Greece won&#x27;t unless strong-armed by Germany and others.<p>Ultimately, a shared currency with nations with such disparate levels of income and corruption just doesn&#x27;t work out in real life like it does on paper. Arguably, Greece could have restructured its debt and engaged in inflation with its own currency and handled this much better, but that&#x27;s not an option when you&#x27;re wed to the Euro. Personally, I like the idea of the EU, but a shared currency is extremely questionable.<p>Credit ratings are just that, ratings, not investment advice and like all ratings should be understood to be of limited value. A nation state can hide quite a bit from organizations like Moody&#x27;s and every election changes leadership, so there&#x27;s no static &quot;Greece.&quot; Instead its a handful of parties fighting for power with different agendas and goals and with differing levels of corruption and incompetence with a baseline being pretty bad to begin with. Heck even senior Moody&#x27;s staff were warning investors about Greece and its dealings with Goldman[1]. You&#x27;d have to be a little thick to think that AAA rating meant no-risk. All investment involves risk.<p>I suspect the larger economies always saw Greece as their &#x27;little brother&#x27; and countries like Germany had a sort of &quot;Well, if we give them money, they&#x27;ll build industry and catch up to us eventually,&quot; instead Greece blew it on pensions for people retiring at 50, questionable social programs, and other unsustainable and unwise spending.<p>I sense a high level of paternalism in general from other Europeans especially when I&#x27;m perceived as a native Greek when in Europe. Sadly, I think everyone would be better off if we were rougher with Greece and instead of seeing it as our tourist-friendly &#x27;little brother,&#x27; but instead as our dishonest and thieving neighbor. I hope this current crisis has changed perception and paternalist attitudes in Europe and made everyone think about the limitations a shared currency creates.<p>[1]

Each state comes up with their own implementation, which can be as secure as they see fit. If you have any friends from Pennsylvania and Minnesota you should ask to compare their licences; only one should seem difficult to reproduce.<p>There really is no national minimum on the security of a drivers license.

comment,14255927,,,1493821739,,zeveb,"No, there&#x27;s no biased assumption that women are worse developers, just one about relative numbers and relative skill distribution.<p>If the number of qualified female developers is less than the number of qualified male developers, then any company which manages to achieve hiring parity has either lowered the qualifications it demands from women developers, or increased the incentives it offers to them relative to other firms (enabling it to capture a higher share of high-skill female developers).  Since the latter approach is obviously discriminatory and quite possibly illegal (not to mention a blatant violation of the principle of equal pay for equal work), the former is more likely.<p>The result of the former is that the median female developer <i>at that company</i> will have lower skill than the median male developer at the same company, even if women in the population at large have the same or better development skill.<p>The incentive strategy could enable a firm to secure the best female talent, but besides the ethical and legal implications it would also make things much worse for all the other firms out there: the best female talent being off the market, those firms would be forced to either settle for lesser-skilled women or accept a disproportionate share of male developers, neither of which would be appealing.<p>Naturally, increasing the supply of women developers to match that of male developers (or reducing the supply of male developers …) would improve the situation, but that&#x27;s a horse of a different colour."

If Fb has put more effort into hiring female engineers directly from college, then they will probably skew junior.  The answer is probably not that simple and as you mentioned, all women are probably being challenged more than their male counterparts.<p>The general tone of this recent article on HN [1] I think was quite negative towards the OP, more so than the median.  I have seen similar behavior in code and architecture reviews, interviews, etc for women at companies I have worked. Everything literally turns into a qual.  Everything they do is judged to much higher standard. Or even non-sensical standard. It is still the case, that when I come across a woman in dev, she is most likely a freak&#x27;n bad ass and has a really thick skin.

comment,14255849,,,1493821256,,maxsilver,"&gt;  [white] Americans are like salmon. They are born in the suburbs, they move to the city to find mates and build careers, then they move to the suburbs to have children.<p>I think the difference is that Americans are <i>forced</i> to do that dance, even the ones that actively <i>don&#x27;t</i> want this.<p>Kids are <i>crazy expensive</i> to have and raise. Just child daycare alone <i>starts</i> at around $1,000&#x2F;month and goes up from there. Housing costs are so high in every single city that if you want to give your kid a bedroom of any kind, you are effectively required to live in the suburbs, unless your extremely wealthy.<p>If you do have the money to stay, then comes the network. Housing in cities gets hard to find at all (no one wants to live near you, since you bring the screaming infant into the building). And American buildings are all built like shit, so everyone can hear everything. Childcare isn&#x27;t just expensive -- it&#x27;s difficult to find at all. (As one example, Seattle daycare waitlists are <i>2 years long</i> in some cases - <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;crosscut.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;parents-seek-alternatives-tough-seattle-childcare"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;crosscut.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;parents-seek-alternatives-tough-...</a> )<p>And we haven&#x27;t even started on the mess that is schooling.<p>Generally, American society treat parents and children like shit, and then forces families to live elsewhere. It&#x27;s no surprise that those parents just up-and-leave to form their own little enclaves out in the suburbs, where they can at least try to remove some of that pain.<p>&gt; That said, when I did live in the suburbs for a while, I found it to be depressing and miserable.<p>Well yeah. It can be depressing and miserable to be poor or working-class-poor. But at least suburbs are a safe and somewhat-affordable place to live. It&#x27;s not like there is an alternative -- there are no functional cities willing to house people. And especially no cities willing to house families at all."
comment,14255846,,,1493821204,,Sacho,"Not necessarily. If the pool of talent is exactly the same(let&#x27;s say 1000 women and 1000 men) and your interviewing process is perfect at determining engineer quality, but you are hiring 80 women and 20 men, then you&#x27;ll hire the top 2% of men and the top 8% of women. Again, just assuming that the talent is exactly the same, the women you&#x27;ve hired will still be worse.<p>In reality, the pool of female talent is very shallow. Again assuming the talent levels are exactly the same, there&#x27;s just not enough highly-skilled women to go around, e.g. if you&#x27;re trying to hire the top 1% of engineers, and you have a pool of 1 million men and 100,000 women, then you&#x27;re looking at 10000 men and 1000 women as your potential hires. If the top 1000 women are already taken, then you&#x27;re forced to relax your interview requirements for women. In fact, if the pool is completely free for your usage, but you&#x27;re looking to hire 10000 men and 10000 women, you&#x27;ll be hiring the top 1% of male talent and down to the top 10% of female talent, which should lead to a difference in output.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that &quot;sexism&quot; isn&#x27;t real or that it&#x27;s not a problem women face in the workplace. The question however, is how to measure the effectiveness of &quot;anti-sexism&quot; practices employed, if you cannot measure the effect of &quot;sexism&quot; itself, as it is entangled with all the other, confounding factors. You can&#x27;t optimize performance if you can&#x27;t measure the effects your solutions have on it."

The answer I&#x27;d heard before was that you should hire the non-conformist, because they&#x27;ve risen to identical positions and accomplishments despite the bias against them at each step, while the stereotypical engineer was probably assumed to belong in the positions they attained.

comment,14255828,,,1493821032,,halfeatenpie,"That&#x27;s a very true statement.  There are things outside our control (and sometimes in it) that can result in downtime.  Like a datacenter downtime event in 2013 where a road construction crew were performing maintenance and ended up cutting their fiber (the location fiber actually was didn&#x27;t line up with where it was supposed to be on paper).  Since then they&#x27;ve built another fiber connection out of the building.<p>In the end, what matters is how they respond to these kinds of events and issues and what actions they take to prevent those issues in the future.  While I can&#x27;t say for certain what issues were avoided through proactive measures, I will state that Linode has been great with setting up fixes that hopefully prevents problems in the future.  DigitalOcean recently had a problem twice with their billing and control panel system going down (in addition to their API being down).  They&#x27;ve also taken action to prevent this in the future and have been fairly open about it (one was their SFO datacenter being down if I recall correctly).<p>My only gripe about Vultr is that their support responses are very basic.  Limited to &quot;try again now&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;ve turned off a neighbor&quot;.  Honestly I was hoping a solution that would work long-term and communication on how they&#x27;re working to ensure that.  DO and Linode focus on relaying that information and I feel really works with me.  This is why I&#x27;m really fine with buying through them even if they&#x27;re technically &quot;twice&quot; as expensive as Vultr.  That peace of mind is really worth it."

As the article mentions, Texas sold nearly all of the federal land it was granted and as a result is currently about 95% privately-owned.<p>For most hunters, this means that you either have to lease private land, which is becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive (think thousands of dollars annually), or hire an outfitter for exorbitant fees. This has priced many people out of hunting and will continue to do so as populations and land development continue to rise. I, personally, have been looking for a hunting lease within a couple hours drive of Austin for the past three years and have not been able to find one - and that&#x27;s with a budget of over $3k&#x2F;year.<p>Without transfer protections that mandate keeping the land public and accessible perpetually, I don&#x27;t know how any outdoorsman could be for this &quot;transfer&quot;."

Nope! Here on business, meeting with Basecamp.</i><p>Wouldn&#x27;t this be under the discretion of the customs officer to determine whether business meeting qualifies as work?

comment,14255702,,,1493820255,,ryanwaggoner,"I think the problem there is one of scale (same as here, actually). Hardly any small planes get built. Cirrus is the largest builder of small airplanes and they sold 276 new aircraft in 2013. These planes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but even if you slashed it so that new planes only cost $50k, you still have two huge hurdles:<p>1. There aren&#x27;t very many certificated pilots in the US (600k?), and a small fraction who fly regularly enough for owning a plane to make sense. Not a huge market.<p>2. This does nothing for operating costs. Fuel, maintenance, insurance, storage all mean that even for a small airplane, you should expect to spend $100 - 300 &#x2F; hr for operating costs, depending on details of the plane and how often you fly. This means that the market really <i>can&#x27;t</i> expand that much.<p>The best hope for putting lots of new airplanes in the air every year is a viable self-piloting VTOL electric aircraft. I don&#x27;t see anything else doing it, and energy density of batteries means that we&#x27;re probably decades away from that."

Doesn&#x27;t matter whether the spying did or did not occur (probably both sides are stretching the truth). We&#x27;re living in an age where it is at least conceivable by a large portion of the country that the NSA&#x27;s tools were improperly used against US citizens.

comment,14255621,,,1493819685,,zeptomu,"Assuming one wants to call C++ code from Python (the common case) I would even start with simple pipe-based IPC and just build an executable in C++ that acts as a bridge between Python (or any other language in this case) and C++. E.g. using JSON serialization it would look like this:<p><pre><code>  $LANG (e.g. Python) &lt;-&gt; JSON &lt;-&gt; Pipe &lt;-&gt; JSON &lt;-&gt; C++
</code></pre>
If this is too slow I still wouldn&#x27;t use a binding generator (SWIG, etc.), but build a C API using opaque pointers that offer the required functions, i.e. a bridge between C and C++. Finally one can simply call into this API with Python&#x27;s ctypes which are part of its standard library.<p><pre><code>  Python &lt;-&gt; ctypes &lt;-&gt; C-API &lt;-&gt; C++
</code></pre>
I have worked previously with SWIG, but my experience has been very bad, in particular the problem with binding generators is similar to the problem parser generator face - they make the simple stuff simple and the hard stuff hard. Furthermore the bindings that are auto-generated are mostly too low-level, so one normally writers wrappers around them to make them more &quot;pythonic&quot; which raises the questions why not write the bindings from scratch anyway?"

comment,14255516,,,1493818851,,awalton,"The question is how much of it should be automated that isn&#x27;t already. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re building 737s and A321s for everyone - at some point, human labor just makes better business sense, though I admit I have no idea where those lines are - I don&#x27;t have the factory experience to tell you.<p>It&#x27;s also likely they&#x27;d pretty significantly redesign a lot of the parts if they were going for more automation - a lot of aircraft construction is done in a way that makes it difficult even for humans to get decent access - the robots to get into those kinds of tight spaces to work would look more appropriate on the International Space Station, and may not be much faster at the job due to all of the extra maneuvering to get in and out of tight spaces. (In fact, on most existing aircraft designs, to do much with robots you&#x27;d almost certainly need a human operator standing by just to make sure it didn&#x27;t accidentally punch through a firewall or the tin can hull, since a lot of assembly steps require moving fixtures around and installing temporaries for support, which may be more ad-hoc than planned procedure.<p>As an example of design and construction philosophies, both Boeing and Airbus have adopted a more &quot;outside-in&quot; approach to building aircraft, where the principal components of the airframe are built first and everything is fastened to them as construction evolves. This is a very human- and aircraft-centric construction philosophy, since it means the workers need to move around the plane a lot, rather than the plane&#x27;s components coming to the workers. This works better with the scales in mind, since the aircraft are already constructed in some of the largest buildings on the planet, and moving large assemblies around a lot during construction means employee downtime and slower delivery performance.<p>But what if instead they took a tunnel building-like approach where the interior would be mostly assembly-line built in ring sections, fastened together into modular inner compartments, and then fitted to external fuselage pieces before everything is snapped together in one big final assembly step? The smaller sections work better for both humans and automation, and the larger pieces snapping together Lego-like means you can even reduce the need for as many large assembly buildings down to just final assembly. It could possibly be much better for composite construction, as it would mean fewer external seams on the aircraft (which in turn must suck for the carbon fiber engineers, since it means even larger autoclaves and components they would have to deal with), which in turn gives you even more of the advantages you already are seeing on planes like the Dreamliner (plus likely a much quieter cabin, since it would be better separated and insulated from the hull, and fewer fasteners means less vibration noise generated as well as shorter assembly times).<p>Of course, Boeing and Airbus are huge companies with lots of extreme long term planning when it comes to budgeting and logistics, so I doubt if either company will make revolutionary strides in this direction rather than evolutionary strides. With product deliveries over multiple decades and lifecycles approaching a century, it&#x27;s easy to see why these companies are conservative and evolutionary."

comment,14255504,,,1493818701,,dahart,"I&#x27;m kind-of mystified what the objections to these new requirements are. 18 hours of coursework, or alternatively, at least have to explain your experience. That&#x27;s a pretty low bar for being able to profess on a subject. If I were taking a course, I would certainly hope the professor had at least 18 hours of graduate coursework on a subject.<p>The rules these people are objecting to literally make an exception for them to explain that 50 years of teaching a subject counts as credit. If they can&#x27;t do that, is it possible they shouldn&#x27;t be teaching the subject?<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t professors have a minimum requirement? It sounds like before these bare minimum rules it was a free-for-all.<p>&gt; I have learned that English and philosophy have much in common.

But a scooter needs insurance, plates, gas, oil, costs tax and at the end of the day they are lawnmowers on wheels, so if something goes wrong with the motor, and it will regularly, you probably can&#x27;t fix it on your own and are stranded. Even if your battery fails or the boost you would likely still have  a fully functional bike, just some extra resistance on the pedals.<p>And legally of course, a scooter restricts you to streets that cars can go on. That might not mean much in an American suburb but even here in a bike backwards German town we have pedestrian zones where bikes are explicitly allowed, one way streets with exemptions for bikes.. being able to use bike-legal paths can make for a more direct, faster route."

comment,14255387,,,1493817703,,alphapapa,"&gt; Sounds to me like voting with your pocket book.<p>It&#x27;s very interesting that you would compare it to voting, because that means we&#x27;re talking about citizens of one country &quot;voting&quot; for the leader of another country--which would mean interfering with another country&#x27;s elections.  Are you sure you want to stick with that analogy?  :)<p>This is in contrast with the traditional definition of &quot;voting with your wallet,&quot; which refers to refusing to do business with <i>companies</i> you don&#x27;t like.<p>&gt; How is this a bad thing?<p>In a nutshell, it&#x27;s bad because it further contributes to polarization and division.  This becomes a self-reinforcing cycle, leading to ever more &quot;us vs. them&quot; thinking.  Eventually it&#x27;s what leads to wars.  Isn&#x27;t it fairly basic political theory that nations which are economically interdependent are less likely to go to war with each other?  If we can&#x27;t do business with anyone who has different political opinions than we do, that&#x27;s a recipe for...well, war.<p>&gt; Would you also object if I didn&#x27;t want to purchase clothes that are manufactured in a way I find morally deplorable? Hey it&#x27;s not the workers fault right?<p>You&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges.  This is not a question of a company mistreating its workers.<p>By the same token, I could ask you why you would punish the innocent workers who didn&#x27;t vote for the candidate you dislike.  By refusing to do business with them, you are hurting them, and it&#x27;s not their fault the candidate got elected.  Even from a purely pragmatic standpoint, this is likely to drive them away, toward your political opponents, who can tell them, &quot;See how nasty the other side is?  They won&#x27;t even trade with us anymore because they disagree with how we run <i>our own country</i>!&quot;<p>That attitude is essentially a large part of why Trump got elected: the Democrats&#x27; constant condescension toward a large swath of the population alienated them.

Neck looking down a lot.<p>On my first employer&#x27;s onboarding training we had a full 4 hour session by the company&#x27;s health &amp; safety officer on how to use our chair and desk, and I&#x27;ve found that extremely useful over the past 15 years.<p>Some takeaways that I&#x27;ve kept with me:<p>* Keep the top bezel of the screen level with your eyes.  I.e. no bending next to see top of screen, and use eyes to look&#x2F;scan down, or neck a bit.<p>* Most office chairs have a knob under where you sit and a latch to pull out on the back allowing inclination&#x2F;declination&#x2F;free movement.  Set latch to free movement then twist this the knob to a setting where you&#x27;re lying back in the chair in a free-balance position - equilibrium easy to find.  I like to leave me chair in that position.<p>* Fortune 500 type companies spent a lot of money trying to avoid being sued.  White-label chairs are commonplace and far higher quality than alternatives.<p>* Desks can be adjusted or swapped out for alternatives.<p>* Consult your health &amp; safety person if you have a persistent problem, or in-house medical staff.  Just let your manager know you&#x27;re contacting them, not related to work.<p>* If you&#x27;d like to sit on a bouncy ball, that&#x27;s OK too.<p>This was not a modern technology company or anything faddish.  This was advice built up over decades of his experience and a century+ of organisational existence.  Just share some 2p."

It&#x27;s wrong that Greece took these huge loans as well, but also it&#x27;s wrong to suggest that they have to pay them back.  Everyone has the option to default when they are unable to pay and this was clearly the situation for Greece (and probably Spain and Italy, maybe even UK soon enough)."

Especially if you&#x27;re coming at this from a specific perspective &quot;This company sucks!&quot;, then you&#x27;re bound to find something that doesn&#x27;t strike you as excellent.<p>At my current company, I do not get any 401k matching, and it sucks. However, the company fully covers medical insurance for each employee and their ENTIRE family. My copay&#x27;s are more then fair, and unless I end up in an emergency and I&#x27;m rushed to a hospital that&#x27;s out network and it turns out that it wasn&#x27;t an emergency, I have no other costs. Being married, I save thousands a year in my paycheck by not having to cover any of my insurance. Compared to the cost of my previous job, the difference is enough to fully fund my IRA which is roughly equivalent to a 4% match in my 401k which is the best any company has offered me to date. So in the end, I lost an employee match, but save $6k a year in medical insurance for my family.<p>It&#x27;s a balance, and I can understand why people would be upset to &quot;only&quot; see six weeks of Paternal leave, but when you look at their entire portfolio of perks, it&#x27;s amazing.

Got into the company as junior developer, grew up quickly, built features on and on, worked like a multi-functional robot across departments so much so that I added value to the whole product and the company.<p>Later, I got a chance to move to a big data company. Jumped into it because I wanted to learn big data problems. The initial days were good, but as days went by, I realised it wasn’t the right company for me. The business focus keeps oscillating and there’s ridiculous levels of politics and over-engineering that delays a product from reaching it’s milestone, and sometimes they end up in trash, wasting the time a developer puts into building it.<p>For someone who has been passionate about working with products &amp; customers, the trouble everyday is a major turn-off. I reached out to a few companies that felt like a good intersection — while some responded, I hardly heard back from a bunch of other companies&#x2F;startups. Is the market down lately?<p>Given my experience in building products &amp; focussing on wide range of other initiatives related to the product, I sometimes feel I should start building a product on my own OR try out flying to places like Chiang Mai and meet people to see if there’s synergy. But, I am totally confused.<p>It feels like my head is in a messed up state, mixed with stress, anxiety about my career and everyday work. Has anybody experienced this before?

comment,14255078,,,1493814542,,6d6b73,"They may not solve congestion, but they should lower it, even it it&#x27;s by a tiny amount. The reason is simple - electric cars don&#x27;t have to visit gas stations which sometimes adds few miles to the miles traveled every month. 
i.e on my way to work I have just one gas station. When I have to fuel my car, (usually once a week) I have to take a different route that&#x27;s about 1&#x2F;2 mile longer than my usual route. That&#x27;s about 25 miles &#x2F;year. If we multiply this by 260mln passenger cars on the roads we get 6.5 billion miles. 
Let&#x27;s go little further with this.. if set avg fuel economy for all of these cars at 20 mpg we get 325000000 gallons of fuel saved each year when all of the cars are electric. 
Funny how small little thing can have big impact.<p>Of course this is just a guesstimate."
comment,14255075,,,1493814518,,chriswarbo,"&gt; F# and all ML derivatives are an aberration because they use juxtaposition to denote function calls. That eliminates a lot of parens but personally I find the result less readable.<p>It makes a lot of sense when all functions are curried. Parenthesised function calls treat all of these as different things:<p><pre><code>    f(a, b, c, d)
    f(a, b, c)(d)
    f(a, b)(c, d)
    f(a, b)(c)(d)
    f(a)(b, c, d)
    f(a)(b, c)(d)
    f(a)(b)(c, d)
    f(a)(b)(c)(d)
</code></pre>
If functions aren&#x27;t curried, then these all mean different things. When functions <i>are</i> curried, all of these have the same semantics (call `f` with `a`, call the result with `b`, call that result with `c` and call that result with `d`); ML&#x27;s juxtaposition syntax makes these semantically-identical expressions syntactically-identical too:<p><pre><code>    f a b c d</code></pre>"

If so, was there ever a serious attempt to change this system?<p>The constitution simply says that each state gets to appoint its electors as it sees fit.<p>Wit that in mind, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact [0] commits states that adopt it to appointing their electors in line with the national popular vote: e.g., in the 2016 election, had it been in force, every state that had adopted it would have chosen electors for Hillary, regardless of how the vote in that state fell.<p>So far, it has been adopted in principle by 10 states and the District of Columbia. However, it doesn&#x27;t come into force until adopted by enough states to achieve an absolute majority in the electoral college; currently, it&#x27;s 105 votes shy.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Popular_Vote_Intersta...</a>"

Sure, most FB product managers are not considered execs these days, but he was their first Product Manager responsible for ad targeting and then their advertising exchange all the way back in 2011. That probably brought with it a team, a good salary and a lot of sway.<p>Unlike the cookie-cutter 9-5 corporations of yesteryear, startups have been pretty loose with standard job naming convention. You can be fresh out of a BA and get called &quot;CMO&quot; or you can be a 20-year veteran leading a team making executive decisions and just be a &quot;Product Specialist.&quot;<p>The responsibilities and compensation define executives far more than titles."

comment,14254736,,,1493810703,,bloomca,"So, many comments here target US or Trump in particular. But in fact, as many noted, there is not real connection – it started long time ago. Also, I bet, there are quotas (e.g. number of people) to be detained, so they have to fulfil it.<p>Also, US is just an example here (because many conferences are held in the US), but also there are stories from the UK, for instance. From my point of view, the problem is that with social networks it is extremely easy to get access to your whole life – it is already pretty easy to identify person on the facebook, for instance (right now there is no way to prove that it is _exactly_ you, but I am pretty sure they will be soon). So, with restrictions on such monopoly media (and I&#x27;ve heard it is already harder to register on the Facebook), it is very easy to end up in a situation where we will get &quot;human score&quot; (similar to credit score, but in the digital world), which will be used in such situation.<p>And even the bigger problem is that it might be needed for a work, for a loan application, etc, so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do all this without it (or even &quot;to apply for a visa your score should be higher than 3.0&quot;. My predictions are that governments will try to work more closely with popular platforms trying to emerge such (there were few stories than people were detained because of tweets) metrics, and to broad access not only from your phone, but from their device, just your user profile."

That&#x27;s your preference. But now consider this use-case:<p>You are installing a new OS, your first OS, on a blank PC, on a new disk. All is grand. No toes to step on. How does that OS deploy its bootloader?<p>You vote it should chose a simplistic way which is optimized for the single-OS use-case. It&#x27;s primary objective: To save space, around 500MB of space, because you think that&#x27;s something which matters.<p>But let&#x27;s say you were actually planning for a dual-boot scenario. Now you&#x27;re in the process of installing your second OS. How should <i>that</i> OS deploy its bootloader?<p>To determine that it is indeed a single-OS use-case (and this that it should use the single-OS simplistic approach, which differs from the multi-OS approach), it needs to find out if another OS and another bootloader is deployed. How should it know that? How should it be certain it doesn&#x27;t overwrite something which doesn&#x27;t belong to it?<p>And since we are now moving from a single-OS solution to a multi-OS solution... Should we migrate the existing simplistically deployed bootloader to a multi-OS config and wipe the existing single-OS configuration?<p>To put it bluntly: Should Windows move Linux&#x27;s bootloader? Can you imagine the outrage? Any and every honest bug in such code would be deemed malicious by internet hotheads and be talked about for decades to come in threads filled with &quot;M$&quot;.<p>And this is all getting very complex, very fast, isn&#x27;t it? It wasn&#x27;t so simple after all, was it?<p>With the EFI-partition there is a simple solution and simple answers for all those questions, at any point. Inspecting the state of bootloaders is simple. Deploying OSes is simple. Avoiding collisions is the default because different OSes namespace their bootloaders inside the EFI partition. Windows doesn&#x27;t even need to know or <i>care</i> if Linux is installed!<p>Everything just works. At a cost. The cost of allocating a few MBs in the age when Terabytes rules.<p>And honestly, I find that a pretty good trade-off."

At American airports if you arrive less than an hour before boarding they might not allow you in until you rebook on a later flight.<p>You could see it in the architecture of their systems: The American facilities have huge snaking queues designed for as much capacity as possible, which lead to obvious bottlenecks.

comment,14254349,,,1493806151,,neel_k,"Girard is French, and The Blind Spot is best understood as a piece of continental philosophy, not analytic.<p>The short version is that back in the late 60s, Althusser suggested that fields of knowledge inherently have &quot;a blind spot&quot; -- his idea was that every field of knowledge has to resort to structuring&#x2F;organizational principles which cannot be properly articulated within the field of knowledge itself. Jacques-Alain Miller applied this idea to logic, arguing that the Fregean definition of equality (and hence number) exhibits precisely this kind of problem. Namely, Frege defined zero as the extension of the predicate &quot;not equal to itself&quot;, and so Frege implicitly excludes the subject from logic, as Lacan had defined &quot;subject&quot; as the non-self-identical.<p>However, Alain Badiou objected very strongly against the extension of Althusser&#x27;s ideas to logic. He thinks that science and mathematics can generate definitively true, objective, non-political knowledge, and so while blind spots can occur in daily (&quot;ideological&quot;) life, they cannot occur in science.<p>Girard is essentially making an argument against Badiou and in favor of Miller. Because Girard is Girard, he never explicitly mentions any of these people in his lectures. This way, he can laugh at those of us who were too ill-informed to catch the fact that the TITLE of his lectures is a direct reference to Althusser.<p>Anyway, Girard begins with Lorenzen&#x27;s idea that  a proof can be understood as a dialogue between a proponent and a refuter, and the observation that the continuation-passing-style translation embedding classical logic into intuitionistic logic doesn&#x27;t require that the answer type of the continuation be the empty type. He observes that these two ideas fit together in Krivine-style realizability models of classical logic: every formula can be interpreted as a set of proofs and refutations, and the interaction of a proof with a refutation yields a behaviour in the answer type. As a programmer, I think of the answer type as the runtime system of a programming language. The Krivine construction ensures that every proof -- every program -- both respects the invariants of the answer type&#x2F;runtime system, and can never observe them.<p>So the runtime system of a programming language exhibits the essential structure of an Althusserian blind spot, and so via Curry-Howard so must logic.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to understand the implications of all this, but I find the idea of bringing continental philosophy into the foundations of logic in a really serious, technically profitable way to be very exciting."

Not many people buy a $35,000 second car."

Things you don&#x27;t need in a SDT world include store parking lots, personal garages and driveways, commuter parking in the daytime, and one car per person.<p>EV+SDT gets you a world where enormous amounts of space can be released for either urban development or rewilding, and where you can breathe the air. It also gives you, conveniently, a world where it&#x27;s much safer to cycle. SDTs will not drive dangerously, and they don&#x27;t have blind spots."

Actually they (rather, the Dept. of the Interior) don&#x27;t charge enough for things like mineral extraction. Think of it this way. You and I and everyone else owns those minerals. The US should make sure that we as taxpayers are getting our fair share of their value. It is the same thought process behind the FCC and spectrum auctions. When there is a public good involved, the government needs to make sure it is being put to the best use for all of the citizens. Not just the first people in the door or the well connected.<p>&gt;Now that a small minority of the country actually uses the land, because people have moved to the cities, nobody notices that this contract is being slowly changed, to the detriment of people who have relied on this public access for a long time.<p>This is an erroneous statement. Where did you read this?<p>More people are using BLM land, especially in the Bears Ears area than ever before. This is because of population growth and increased awareness of BLM land. In the past, it was just ranchers and hunters using the land. Now people go hiking, ride ATVs, ride horses (for fun, not work like in the past), etc."

This order is important.<p>First there is an event. A person applies for security clearance, there&#x27;s a robbery, somebody reports a crime, and so on.<p>Second there is an investigation. Based on the nature of the event reported, facts are gathered to determine whether or not the state needs to intervene. More importantly, the people are identified that need intervention. Based on the investigation, sometimes the state might intervene with force, as in when a SWAT team shows up at your door.<p>The order is clear, and necessary. Event &gt; data gathering &gt; investigation &gt; people. We start with an event and end up with people who might be criminals. That&#x27;s because everybody is guilty of something. It&#x27;s important to limit the state to only go after people where there is a clear, independent prompt for something to happen, ie, an event.<p>But what if we change it around? What if we collect data all the time? Well then we are no longer limited to having a good and independent reason for taking action. Instead, now <i>we can start with the person and then figure out what they&#x27;re guilty of until it justifies the action we&#x27;ve already selected</i>. And guess what? Everybody is guilty of something.<p>All we&#x27;ve done is create a machine where we can identify people we don&#x27;t like, push a button, and then find reasons to put them in jail or apply force to them in other ways. Free countries cannot continue operating in an environment like that. Because we&#x27;ve made the law do our bidding, there is effectively no rule of law.

comment,14253680,,,1493795952,,Dylan16807,"&gt; He would respond that it was <i>the</i>
onion routing, the original program
of projects from NRL. It was Rachel Greenstadt who noted
to him that this was a nice acronym and gave Tor its name.
Roger then observed that it also works well as a recursive
acronym, ‘Tor’s onion routing’. It was also his decision that
it should be written ‘Tor’ not ‘TOR’. Making it more of an
ordinary word in this way also emphasizes the overlap of
meaning with the German word ‘Tor’, which is gate (as in
a city gate).
To sum up, “Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router”
is about the design of onion-routing systems, not just onion
routers themselves. Tor is the third generation of onion rout-
ing, not the second. And the ‘r’ in ‘Tor’ represents ‘routing’
not ‘router’.  In hindsight we probably should have spent a
bit more time on the paper title.<p>You have a significantly different definition of &quot;not an acronym&quot; than I do."
comment,14253677,,,1493795898,,Steeeve,"Hmm...<p>My first thought was that 151M call records is not a significant amount considering that we&#x27;re talking about the population of the United States.<p>Rough calculations based on some very round numbers is that this would account for between .019 and .033 percent of the adult US population.  (~150M call records&#x2F;year ~= 50-80,000 people, US Adult Population ~ 242,470,800)<p>Extrapolated, that number is a little concerning.  By my estimate, that means between 2 and 3 of every 10K people is under some sort of surveillance.<p>But then again... apply that to say... San Francisco - population ~900K and you get between 180 and 270 people.  Or NYC with 1.7M people and you get between 340 and 510 people."

comment,14253386,,,1493791200,,mtgx,"I agree. I think all EVs will ideally have at least a 100 kWh battery pack, which is what will give that 300-350 mile range. Higher-end cars should be switching to 150-200 kWh by 2025.<p>This is also why I think nobody should bother building EV chargers anymore unless they are at least 350 kW (the latest standard for CCS). Because once they are built, they&#x27;ll probably stay the same for at least 15 years. 50 or 100 kW chargers will seem useless in 15 years."

comment,14253359,,,1493790591,,YZF,"Etsy has to invest effort in making sure that legitimate sellers don&#x27;t have this gamble.  They have to be sure they&#x27;re only penalizing the spammers.  It&#x27;s not unlike insurance fraud, do you feel it&#x27;s a gamble that you&#x27;re getting insurance because the insurance company won&#x27;t pay out or will pursue you for fraud?  Probably not.  Yet they still try to identify and prosecute the fraud.  If the site is dominated by spammers selling stuff from the dollar store everyone loses.  You have to make it so that it&#x27;s not worthwhile for the spammers.  A deposit is one way.  Pursuing legal action for contract violation could be another.  Another industry with similar issues is banking.<p>It&#x27;s not easy but you have to invest in maintaining the credibility of your platform.  Machine learning helps but these problems have existed pre machine learning and can have more traditional economic solutions.<p>EDIT: The deposit could also depend on your prices and sale volume.  This way really small players can pay in with a lower  deposit.  There are probably many variations but again the key is to make it a losing proposition for the spammers&#x2F;dollar store guys assuming you want them off your platform.  If you&#x27;re only doing machine learning&#x2F;filtering the cost to attack the system and try to get in is too low."

You add your primitive types, primitive functions, primitive type operators (like algebraic types) and voila - you are pretty much set. That way, you get lot of reusability which would be hard to do in an adhoc designed declarative language. And a very uniform syntax as a nice bonus.<p>My question is not rhetorical. Building declarative languages based on typed lambda calculus is very well understood."

comment,14253224,,,1493788534,,ChuckMcM,"The important thing to take away from that experience is that the detractors were all correct, as far as any extrapolation of then <i>current</i> technology into the future could take them.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced that cycle several times where I thought &quot;oh this will be big in 10-20 years&quot; and had people say &quot;No, reason x, y, and z all mean it won&#x27;t happen.&quot; and then some discovery or change in the situation made x, y, and z irrelevant.<p>As a result I&#x27;ve trained my self to look at it &quot;in reverse&quot; as it were, which is to say &quot;currently x, y, and z makes it impossible, what would have to change to make x, y, and z irrelevant?&quot; and then look for changes in the margins. Things like &quot;making oil from corn&quot; is impractical when oil is $35 a barrel but quite reasonable when oil is $150 a barrel. Or &#x27;cracking hydrogen and oxygen&#x27; with electrolysis takes more energy than you get back, so how can you exploit &#x27;wasted&#x27; energy like sunlight to help it along? etc.<p>The important thing is to avoid trapping yourself into believing nothing will change that isn&#x27;t already known.

comment,14253206,,,1493788219,,jmulvi,"You are missing the point. I said &quot;educated young people... move to world class cities&quot;. These world class cities are also expensive. You pay a lot to live in New York, Los Angeles or London. Unfortunately, this lack of affordable housing pushes out all but the highest paid workers. There is some social housing and other benefits to help the very poor. Everyone in the middle gets squeezed out of the big cities, especially when they marry and&#x2F;or have kids and need more space. So, a lot more people would like to live in San Francisco for example than can currently afford it. This is why less well educated young people are moving to the newest suburbs. It&#x27;s what they can afford.  These new suburbs often have the fewest and lowest paying employment opportunities so it&#x27;s a long term drain on the economy and future growth."

comment,14253176,,,1493787629,,wordupmaking,"&gt; &quot;Morally good&quot; is dependent on perspective.<p>Yes, and? A computer stuck in a loop also is working perfectly fine &quot;according to its own logic or perspective&quot;. That is its perspective, just like the moral judgement of others is their perspective. This does not lessen my own perspective and judgement one iota, and changing adjectives doesn&#x27;t really help. That is, I wouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;morally good ones&quot;, I would have said people who weren&#x27;t abused to created an bottomless hole in their mind. But what is abuse? What is a hole? A matter of perspective, and it&#x27;s not like I can point to any results of my own ideals and actions other than the heat death of the universe... so who&#x27;s to judge? I am, and you are, and then we simply append &quot;IMO&quot; to everything when someone forgets to explicitly mention it.<p>Also, yes, sometimes people are thinking they are helping others. Sometimes they are not, and sometimes they revel in that. Are you sure those don&#x27;t exist? Why do you just mention people who mean well? That&#x27;s fantasy, not nuance. Where are the lines between those people, and people who hear voices telling them they need to murder babies to avoid some space monster from eating Earth, and from people who know they are hurting and destroying people, but are convinced they deserve it, who have an inner reservoir of fear and pain that, in their mind, dwarves the lives of anybody else who ever existed? And even all that is not even beginning to touch <i>nuance</i>.<p>When someone implies <i>everybody</i> would be tempted by power, that&#x27;s lacking nuance, too, and even just going &quot;nah, I personally disagree&quot; does restore some of it, any further qualifiers are a bonus. I agree that &quot;this is evil&quot; does not carry very much information, but neither does &quot;some might mean well&quot;. Not well enough to stop the ones who don&#x27;t mean well, so let those take a number. It takes one bad apple, and a lot of good apples who don&#x27;t have hands or suck at throwing, to spoil the whole damn barrel."

But how many leads and stars are male versus female?<p>And this is movies. This is a fictional world. This is where you can rewrite the rules and depict the world as you would like to show it. But Hollywood still shows more men in lead roles than women.<p>So the representation of women on screen is not equal to the representation of women in real life. But it could be. And it&#x27;s not even equal to an ideal representation of women based on equality. But it could be. Because it&#x27;s a movie you can make it however you want to make it.

Only a year later they carried out a larger scale project with rats that had the HIV virus &lt;sic&gt; in basically all of their body cells.  By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats tails they were able to remove more than 50% of the virus from cells all over the body.

comment,14252876,,,1493783086,,19eightyfour,"I agree there ought to be a human readable prefix. Zurl is not bad!<p>I don&#x27;t think compression can really compete with a hash table for key size. Because they&#x27;re different beasts: compression finds the smallest representation for the entropy present in one text, hashing sort of  finds the smallest  distinguishable  key for the entropy of the whole table space.  Whatever that means! I&#x27;m no expert.<p>But competing can be a fun exercise to try get this to be smaller. And I&#x27;ve included versioning prefix bits so we know which version of the compression we&#x27;re using.<p>So you can say it&#x27;s sort of trying to compete with the hash table URL shorteners. It&#x27;s not really, it&#x27;s sort of trying to do something different as well. I just wanted something like a space efficient transport format for URLs that was going to just do better than base64 expanding them. And I liked that I send them a anywhere in an opaque block. That&#x27;s pretty much all. Other motivations like we can avoid relying on an arbitrarily sized  and growing database, swap that out for relying on a piece of distributable code, are sort of motivations, too.<p>But having the kind of fake-comparison Benchmark performance of URL shortner I think is also useful motivation to try to make this most space efficient as well. So I don&#x27;t want to say that it&#x27;s not competing because I think it&#x27;s a use for motivation to try to get this shorter."

Insofar as the Nazi historians were concerned, the cause the the bodies deaths was their violation of some social contract. This minimally supported hypothesis was used successfully to help incite the events leading up to Kristallnacht.

3. so if they are working locally, you are mostly going to give the top guys valley-like comp
4. the rest of the talent is cheaper<p>... which doesn&#x27;t sound too bad, as far as it goes.  But then you run into an issue.  There&#x27;s going to be some specific skill that you need and you simply are not going to be able to hire it locally.  So now you&#x27;re in the position of hiring a remote worker or trying to get someone to move.

What I mean is that the big bucks in agribusiness go towards lowest-common-denominator choices of poor quality.<p>Simple example, most milk in the US comes from Holstein cows because they produce more than other breeds. But if you get milk from Jersey cows (smaller and browner) it&#x27;s much fattier and generally more flavorful. Of course it&#x27;s also a bit more expensive but not that much more...but you&#x27;ll be hard put to find it outside of a farmer&#x27;s market or specialty grocer.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to put all the blame on consumers for poor nutritional choices.

Fast forward to the present, the teeter totter has tipped, the situation has reversed, side effects far outweigh getting what you need to survive.

They, after all, increased quotas for pacific salmon fishing that decimated the Canadian fisheries for years.  Why?  In retaliation for the unsustainable Canadian softwood lumber prices (that were shutting down all the US mills).  It&#x27;s politics all the way down, unfortunately.<p>I do agree that we need international level agreements, but I trust the US exactly the same as I trust most other governments on this issue.  I think one of the biggest problems is that it&#x27;s a bit like global warming.  Most people simply deny that there&#x27;s a problem.  In fish-loving Japan, where I live, <i>nobody</i> will listen to me.  They sell cod illegally fished from the grand banks in the super market.  They even have a big sign &quot;Grand Banks Cod!!!&quot;  I think if I brought an east cost Canadian fisherman to Japan, they&#x27;d go postal.  But, if I try to educate someone, the response is always, &quot;It has to be a lie.  Look at all the cheap fish in the super market.  If it was really getting scarce, then there would be no fish there.  People in other parts of the world just want to complain about the Japanese.  That&#x27;s all it is&quot;.<p>If the US was a fish eating nation, I have very little doubt that the same thing would be happening, unfortunately.<p>My supervisor at university did fish population simulations as his research.  He published a paper, maybe 30 years ago now, where he predicted the collapse of all wild fisheries.  Nobody paid any attention to it.  It seems to be on track now..."

Whichever way you go, you will want a multi stage ro system with a sediment, carbon (I can&#x27;t recall which of the sediment or the carbon is doubled up but one is) and polishing carbon filter post membrane.<p>I used to work on ultra high purity water systems for pharma so I probably care more about water quality than most consumers.

    When given a var’iable X
    that’s already in the context
    with some type called T
    then obviously
    that T is the type of that X.

    [App]
    Encountering two terms abreast
    where the former’s a function, you test
    that the function can take
    what the argument makes;
    its result gives the type of the rest.

    [Abs]
    The term “lambda from X to E”
    infers as the type A to B
    if the context, extended
    with X represented
    as A, says E typechecks as B.

    [Let]
    The type that is lastly inferred
    when a term’s bound with “let” to a word
    —and the body can cope
    with that name bound in scope—
    is the type that the body incurred.

    [Inst]
    If you don’t find it too esoteric
    and you happen to have some barbaric
    too-general expression
    then at your discretion
    you can choose a type that’s less generic.

    [Gen]
    If the type of a term could abide
    any type that a user supplied,
    and the name occurs not
    free in context, you’ve got
    a type var that’s forall-quantified.

If the Cas9 guide sequence is too generic it&#x27;ll take out stuff besides HIV (stuff you need). &quot;<p>Unless I&#x27;m grossly misunderstanding how CRISPR works, there&#x27;s no conceptual reason why you couldn&#x27;t target multiple sequences <i>at the same time</i>, with a cocktail method. That is, rather than trying a single overly broad match, you could go for (say) ten highly-specific targets at the same time. A particular HIV virion would then have to differ in <i>all ten</i> regions to avoid getting chopped up.<p>Just spitballing here:<p>Google tells me that HIV has a mutation rate of about 4E-3 per base.<p>Let&#x27;s say you choose target sequences ten bases long (I don&#x27;t know what the maximum practical length for the technology is, nor the minimum length you&#x27;d need to reliably tell HIV from human, and Google isn&#x27;t any immediate help there).<p>The probability that there will be a mutation in that sequence is then about 0.04. However, if you target ten sequences simultaneously, the probability that all ten would be mutated is (0.04)^10 ~= 1e-14.<p>That&#x27;s likely more than good enough to assure that there weren&#x27;t any resistant mutants around (if by some chance there are...lather, rinse, repeat).<p>This is hand-waving, to be sure.

This is true as far as it goes, but that path assumes relatively low marginal costs - not the case for energy. Coal isn&#x27;t that economical - as for fracking, that&#x27;s new tech not old; it may be a big part of the picture for a long while, and save some but not most of the old plant (large numbers of gas generators are a fairly recent phenomenon themselves.) From your selective choice of terminology, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve looked at economic theory in depth, here. In any case, all of this is perfectly consistent with what I said earlier.<p>When the transistor arrives, vacuum tubes are just swept aside despite the fixed costs. Ten years did that, less in fact, I was there. There&#x27;s a rather extreme threshold effect, once the right price point is passed, the old tech just falls off a cliff. There&#x27;s a great chart of that happening to Kodak due to digital photography, extremely suddenly, despite all the fixed costs. They were making their best profits one year, staring at death the next. This link is close to the chart I remember seeing. Note the extraordinary difference one year makes! Every mall had a very expensive photo developing plant, then not. Scrap value only.

comment,14252357,,,1493775489,,nemo1618,"&gt;my guess before reading the paper is that the contract gives a hash and a file size and the host is responsible for giving a file of that size and that hash if there is a dispute<p>Close! Sia uses Merkle trees to construct the storage proof. The storage contract specifies the Merkle tree root hash. The host must then provide one of the &quot;leaves&quot; of the tree (64 bytes of actual data), along with the other subtree roots in the tree necessary to construct the root hash. The consensus algorithm can then verify that by hashing the leaf and combining it with the other subtree roots, the top-level root can be obtained. This is a lot more compact and efficient than sending the entire file contents. The only trick is selecting <i>which</i> leaf to demand from the host -- if it could be predicted in advance, the host could cheat and store less data. But it can&#x27;t be purely random either, since all nodes on the network need to pick the same leaf to arrive at consensus. So the leaf is chosen using existing entropy in the blockchain (e.g. the hash of the last block), so that it&#x27;s both deterministic and difficult for an attacker to control."

These are the places smart young people move to after they graduate university, the places where many of the top universities are based, they are also expensive due to this success.<p>The suburbs are finding it harder to attract educated 20 somethings because of a lack of professional opportunities as well as changing lifestyle trends. I think there will be a graying-out of the suburbs as they get older until property prices become affordable to young professionals and the work&#x2F;commute times become more bearable.

Different brands have different mineral content, and sometimes other things that can affect taste.<p>Furthermore, I think the packaging may affect it sometimes. At least that is my guess after buying a case of small bottles of one particular brand to see if they would be more convenient than filling my own bottles with filtered tap water, and finding that the damn things had a strong flavor that is what I imagine you would get if you ate an ear of corn on the cob for lunch at a picnic on a hot day, and then left the cob sitting out on the table for a few hours until it gets to that state where it has that &quot;it was once part of food, but now it is garbage&quot; smell, and then stuck it in your water and let it sit there for a few more hours, pulled it out, and then drank the water.<p>Since I cannot believe that they <i>intended</i> this flavor, I&#x27;m assuming it is something that leached out of the cheap plastic they used for the bottles."

Someone could trivially create a new, longer chain with the genesis block at it&#x27;s root and completely rewrite the transaction history, but since they can&#x27;t trivially create blocks that prove more work (as in proof-of-work), no other clients would use that chain.<p>That said, clients will choose the <i>valid</i> chain that took the most work to create. If someone with 51% starts creating invalid blocks, nobody else will accept them, and the practical effect will just be a 51% reduction in mining power on the network.<p>EDIT: Oops, brain fault.

comment,14252183,,,1493772948,,ue_,"&gt;far more than the exact amount required to sustain the worker<p>This would appear true, if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the capitalist would be losing out if it wasn&#x27;t the case; the price of labour power is indeed governed and fluctuates with supply and demand, and I would agree that government regulations have also contributed to setting this price, but to pay workers more than what is required to sustain them would be as nonsensical in a business sense as paying more for a machine than its value. I was perhaps too succinct with that point, Marx writes elsewhere:<p>&quot;The lowest and the only necessary wage rate is that providing for the subsistence of the worker for the duration of his work and as much more as is necessary for him to support a family and for the race of labourers not to die out.&quot;<p>&gt; I signed up for the deal, and that&#x27;s the deal I got. Nobody forced me into it in any way. Being kidnapped and forced to work for free, against your will?<p>This is a very short sighted and restricted view of coercion. Perhaps force was too strong a word. But the worker only works for the capitalist class on pain of death or destitution. If this isn&#x27;t forced, I&#x27;m not sure what is. The prostitute must sell her body, and you can say that&#x27;s a deal &quot;she signed up for&quot; but it won&#x27;t change the fact that she&#x27;s being exploited, having no choice but to sign such a deal with <i>someone</i>.<p>&gt;If I wanted to find a deal where I worked part time, I could almost certainly find it.<p>That&#x27;s still wage labour though, and you&#x27;re still having your own labour decided its use by someone else. You don&#x27;t have to be your own manager, the point is that you should have free association to choose who you want to work for and what you want to do, rather than a much more limited choice which restricts your true capabilities and creativity to merely what drives profit. This is a common complaint among programmers for example. It is a reason why workers are so alienated from the products they make; the products are made for people they&#x27;ll never see, for uses they can&#x27;t understand.<p>&gt;Has automation left us worse off? I don&#x27;t believe it has. I believe that, taken as a whole, it has made us far better off.<p>Automation usually means that the capitalist has been able to buy machinery which performs the same job with a lower socially necessary labour time than a worker. This means that one or more workers are replaced by such machinery, as the value of their labour is only some fraction of what it was before (going along with Marx&#x27;s theory of value anyway). Marx writes:<p>&quot;The labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time. The introduction of power-looms into England probably reduced by one-half the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth. The hand-loom weavers, as a matter of fact, continued to require the same time as before; but for all that, the product of one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hour’s social labour, and consequently fell to one-half its former value.&quot;<p>Now instead of the worker being afforded the benefit of this replacement, it&#x27;s used for short term profit. The savings could be passed onto the worker (rather than the &quot;consumer&quot;) but instead the worker must be either re-purposed within the same firm or industry, or find himself out of a job. On a large scale, this usage of automation means that people find themselves having to do other labour, despite the demands of society not increasing. This seems ridiculous and wasteful to me. But the capitalist maintains that it is necessary - for if there are no labourers to pay wages to, who is there to buy back the products, unless production is for a bourgeois commodity economy?<p>And here is the paradoxical nature of capitalism: it relies upon inefficiency, to combat the falling rate of profit in the long run, due to less extraction of surplus and increasing number of people finding themselves without wage labour to perform, the introduction of automation is carefully controlled and indeed limited. It is not individual firms which do this limiting, but the flows of capital ensure it occurs.<p>Aside from this we have other examples such as the internal contradictions of capitalism[0]; one of which is the tendency to engage in constant overproduction (that is, production above what will drive a profit, not above what will satisfy human wants and needs). As [1] explains:<p>&quot;For Marx, capitalist crises are crises of “overproduction”: too many commodities are produced than can be profitably sold, and too much capital has been invested in industry, in the attempt to claim a share of the available profits. This comes about because capitalism, on both the domestic and international scale, is a system of separate and independent ownerships. In prosperous times every capitalist invests as much as he can and steps up production; in particular, the periodic booms stimulate the production of “fixed capital,” the buildings and machinery which are not used up in one cycle of production and therefore do not have to be immediately replaced. When times are good, all resources are strained to bring new fixed capital into production; but once this capital starts producing, a flood of commodities is brought onto the market, and the crisis ensues. Unemployment, which falls during the boom, rises again; the high rate of profit that stimulated the boom declines, first when the low level of unemployment strengthens the bargaining power of workers, and further when the crisis forces production to slacken off.<p>The crisis eventually takes its toll: masses of workers are thrown out of their jobs, as a result wages are forced back down toward subsistence or below, and the weakest, smallest and least modern plants go under. But the effects of the slump enable profitability to revive: labor can be hired at low wages, factories, equipment and materials can be bought by the surviving capitalists at bargain prices. So the slump is followed by a new recovery period and in turn by a new boom.&quot;<p>This is no new theory, it is even recognised by the modern bourgeois economists of today. But they do not consider it something inherent to capitalism, they consider it instead merely an anomaly that occurs here and there.<p>This is all of course ignoring the ethical problems of capitalism, the fact of private property being acquired through barbarism (as Proudhon writes) and the concentration of the whole productive power of society in the hands of a few, leading to massive status of misery despite medical and technological achievements of capitalism which have lifted many out of poverty, as Kropotkin writes.<p>&quot;rich in what we already possess... richest of all in what we might win from the soil, from our manufactures, from our science, from our technical knowledge, were they but applied to bringing about the well-being of all&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internal_contradictions_of_capital_accumulation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internal_contradictions_of_cap...</a>

Patents incentivize publicly releasing an invention instead of keeping it a trade secret (or letting it languish). The <i>problem</i> this is solving is that ideas aren&#x27;t valued by the market, only products. But society benefits from ideas independent of products. And so the solution is a system to put value on ideas, ergo patents. This meshes with my alternate description."

comment,14252150,,,1493772544,,beloch,"Microsoft&#x27;s hardware game seems to be finally picking up steam.  They used to be a big step behind Apple (e.g. Zune), but now they seem to be finally competing and doing quite well on both price and quality.  It will be interesting to see if they embrace selling hardware as a core source of revenue or continue to treat hardware as a way to suck customers into their ecosystem.<p>Microsoft is now decently involved with Linux and open source on many fronts.  Certainly moreso than Apple.  Macbooks are well supported by Linux <i>in spite</i> of Apple&#x27;s wishes, not because of them.  A lot of people love Apple hardware and work hard to build support for it.<p>Microsoft doesn&#x27;t need to trouble themselves by selling Surfaces or Surface Laptops with linux pre-installed, but they could ensure that popular distros support their hardware well and are relatively well tested by release day (and publicize this, of course). This would allow them to steal some market share from Apple and Lenovo.  The Linux laptop market probably isn&#x27;t that huge but, like education users, it does cover a lot of people who might influence the purchases of others.<p>I&#x27;d be sorely tempted to buy one of these surface laptops because the hardware looks great.

comment,14252123,,,1493772163,,ChuckMcM,"This is something which is really a challenge.<p>In many markets discovery is a challenge (how do you create visibility to all of the customers who might be interested in your product) and then operational costs when your concept is discovered.<p>When brainstorming things I heard an idea which I thought was pretty cool, create a &quot;trademark&quot; registry in these bespoke market places. It would work by sending the market maker (Etsy in this case) pictures and a description of an item you are going to sell on the site.<p>They would take those images and descriptions and first verify that nothing else on the site already had both the same look and application, and then they would issue you a &quot;trademark&quot; for the product which you could start selling and advertising. If it was popular and someone tried to make copies, they would not be allowed to sell them on Etsy because when they submitted pictures and descriptions it would be apparent they were too similar to an existing product.<p>It is interesting to consider what the overall effect of such a system would be, we know that it would give a strong &#x27;first mover&#x27; advantage (+1 to the sellers) but also prevent price competition (-1 to the buyers). It would help prevent counterfeits (+1 to the buyers) and might limit a seller selling their own product because the copy had already gotten to the market first (-1 to sellers).<p>I put trademark in quotes because while this is exactly the role of trademarks in the US, it is too expensive to pursue trademark violations for a $10 bracelet that you sell may 20 a month of. So you need a locally implemented system that can reduce the cost to implement and as much as possible automate enforcement through policy."

(Note: pure supposition this is what they mean by &#x27;record&#x27;, but phone carriers giving them a metadata firehose <i>seems</i> consistent with what we know.)<p>So, we&#x27;re talking 0.1% (and quite possibly less) of the phone calls?<p>Ya know, I&#x27;m probably okay with that level of snooping on metadata from a spy agency (especially if they&#x27;re not sharing the data with domestic agencies for domestic cases).<p>Ed:<p>I&#x27;m likely off by being at least an order of magnitude too low -- divide all my estimates of people targeted by 10 or so."

comment,14252078,,,1493771571,,devoply,"i could argue that addictive foods are similarly predatory. they have long lasting impact on the health of a person the same way that payday loans have on their economic health. predatory is arbitrary, the question is what is the impact of the harm. and can people be expected to control themselves or at least regulate themselves when presented with the option, so as to act in their best interest. for many things in the economy i don&#x27;t believe this to be the case.<p>yet business gets done and the system at least appears to continue to function. people learn from their mistakes and move on if the damage isn&#x27;t too great. or they get caught up and stuck and that&#x27;s a problem that needs regulation."

comment,14252072,,,1493771526,,eliudnir,"I ordered a rustic pipe desk from Etsy a while back and the seller was not able to deliver the item on time. He&#x2F;she communicated the issue so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal for me. I had a prearranged vacation coming up while waiting for the item to be finished and sent, so things took a little bit longer then expected on both ends.<p>When I finally got back home and put the desk together, I noticed that there were items missing and some things had not been packaged well so they were damaged&#x2F;scuffed in shipping. Most of the issues were minor and I decided to not make a stink about it with the seller as I could easily work around and fix the problems. I did however want to leave a review of my experience for the seller to be made aware and future buyers to be warned.<p>Etsy&#x27;s policy was however to deny me to review an item outside of a certain time window. I emailed Etsy&#x27;s customer service to petition that I should be allowed to leave a review even though my window had passed given that the seller could not deliver in the time he&#x2F;she had promised. Etsy&#x27;s replies and refusal to allow this left a permanent impression on me and I will never spend another dollar there as a result of this ordeal."

comment,14251931,,,1493770026,,AnimalMuppet,"&gt; ... the labourer receives a wage, which is equal to the exact amount required to sustain the worker and keep him within the labour force and introduce new labourers.<p>I know that&#x27;s how Marx said it works, but it doesn&#x27;t actually work that way.  Many, many, many people get paid far more than the exact amount required to sustain the worker.  Look around at what actually happens in the labor market, not at what your theory says happens.<p>&gt; So here we have one element of force: the forceful appropriation of one&#x27;s products of labour at the end of the production process.<p>That&#x27;s not forceful.  I signed up for the deal, and that&#x27;s the deal I got.  Nobody forced me into it in any way.  Being kidnapped and forced to work for free, against your will?  <i>That&#x27;s</i> forced labor.  Being a &quot;wage slave&quot;?  No.<p>(Now, I will grant you that, in many times and many places, I could choose freely among the few, bad offers available to me.  When all the mill owners collude to only pay subsistence wages, my freedom to choose is... not worth very much.  Nevertheless, I deny that it is fair to paint all of capitalism with that brush.)<p>&gt; The next element of force is that the labourer is required to work under the direction of someone else, usually the highest bidder for the worker&#x27;s labur-power commodity (if he can find such a bidder), rather than voluntarily decide with others how much or how to work.<p>If I wanted to find a deal where I worked part time, I could almost certainly find it.  As for the rest... I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to be the manager.<p>&gt; And finally the third element of force, that the worker is required to work more in return for less, despite no social need to do so as a result of increased automation, which could be used to alleviate workload rather than increase short-term profits.<p>Has automation left us worse off?  I don&#x27;t believe it has.  I believe that, taken as a whole, it has made us far better off.<p>You&#x27;re giving me Communist theory (no surprise, given that your profile says &quot;Communist&quot;).  But the real world does not work the way your theory says it does.  (It works less like Marx said than it did when Marx was writing.  To some degree, that might be due to Marx scaring the capitalists into behaving better.  Still, Marxist theory is less applicable to the current world than it was to the world of 1900.)"

If nothing else gets you beforehand, with age as all mammals &quot;we caramelize (glycation) &amp; we go rancid&quot; (oxidation). When photosynthesizing microorganisms emerged and oxygenated the planet, it likely wiped out 90% of life as it existed pre-oxygen (not multicellular back then --- which could well predominantly be an adaptation to protect weaker &quot;inner&quot; cells against oxygen, anyway --- the other great adaptation was proto-mitochondria getting an actual massive energy boost from burning oxygen rather than being burned by it, and here we are today!)"

comment,14251820,,,1493768984,,int_19h,"IMO that is also not consistent with observations of real-world markets. Part of the reason, perhaps, is that such feedback would only exist if a relatively small part of the market is irrational, while the rest of it is - then the irrational part is, in a sense, &quot;punished&quot; by the rational part for deviation. But if the entirety of it is irrational, then it&#x27;s not at all a given that acting irrationally would actually produce a worse result for that particular actor - it may well produce a better result due to irrational behavior of other actors.<p>It could be argued that so long as <i>someone</i> in the market is worse off, they would &quot;correct&quot; their behavior, and that would cause a cascade of punishment&#x2F;correction for other actors in the chain. The problem with that is that it&#x27;s not an instant process, and the time scales on which it works - especially when the actors that get the short end of the stick also have relatively little market power individually (and so often would need to organize to effect any meaningful pushback), and so this process is simply too slow - it doesn&#x27;t actually produce an observable result on a scale on which <i>individual humans</i> feel it, and so it&#x27;s insufficient to affect their behavior. And by the time it does happen, other irrationalities may well be introduced that may often mask the effect, or simply make it irrelevant.<p>(FWIW, I&#x27;m generally very suspicious of the Austrian school precisely because it <i>actively rejects</i> empiricism in economics, and substitutes hacks like &quot;praxeology&quot; in its place.)"

But there aren&#x27;t startups (with the aim of fast growth through innovation, usually helped along by venture capital) everywhere.<p>The local scene matters. Most importantly, it affects the rate of people starting companies. If there are other startups around you, you can learn from them. You may not think things like accelerators, meetups, and startup-related college talks matter, but that stuff is really key for creating first-time founders.<p>As far as investors, it matters in angel + seed rounds, but matters far less past that (because you can fly to your investors). But having a way to access those early investors (when founders are still learning how to talk to investors, and trying to raise the money to run a company full-time) is very important.<p>I think it&#x27;s probably a lot easier for a second-time founder to start a company outside of a &quot;scene&quot;. But even in that case, having a larger talent pool is nice, and the convenience of being closer to investors.<p>All of the cities you mentioned (besides Des Moines, Iowa) have at least some sort of startup scene that I&#x27;ve heard of. It&#x27;s a power-law distribution, but for most founders the value of moving from Des Moines to NYC, or from Boston to SV, is pretty compelling."

comment,14251667,,,1493767869,,rayiner,"C++ is an extremely challenging language to write a wrapper generator for. I did a C++ to Common Lisp generator about a decade ago for my GSoC project, based on GCC-XML (with the goal of being able to wrap QT). The two challenges you run into are that the GCC C+ ABI is extremely complicated and requires a runtime on top of whatever low-level C FFI you&#x27;re working with.<p>The second is that many semantics just don&#x27;t map very easily. I imagine the latter problem has only gotten worse with heavier use of templated types in APIs. It looks like CLIF doesn&#x27;t expose the template per se (at least in the Python examples) but requires explicit instantiation of each specialization as a distinct Python class. Templates mess with the very concept of an FFI generator, which tends to assume a reasonably clear separation between compile time and run time (so you don&#x27;t need to run a C++ compiler as a pre-pass on any code that uses a binding).<p>All that is a roundabout way of saying: for god&#x27;s sake write your system APIs in C."

comment,14251646,,,1493767695,,ergothus,"Maybe I&#x27;m overly cynical, but I found the article and many of the comments here annoying.<p>Yes - rural people can be nice, helpful, friendly, wise, experienced, and unpretentious.<p>Rural people can also be short-sighted, rude, intolerant, gleefully embrace ignorance, and every bit as pretentious as a city-slicker.<p>This is because whether it&#x27;s city, suburban, or rural, we&#x27;re all still people. And here&#x27;s the kicker:  All things being equal, people are people, and some are jerks and others saints.  But things AREN&#x27;T equal.  I&#x27;ve lived in trailers, and I&#x27;ve owned a house - I can&#x27;t tell you about your neighbors in those situations, but I can tell you about the areas.<p>I won&#x27;t speculate the reasons here, but rural areas (more in the American South than other places I&#x27;ve been, but still in general)   have more than their share of bitter, racist, sexist, intolerant, xenophobic, self-righteous people.  This is demonstrable in a variety of statistical ways by look at different states&#x2F;counties.<p>When reviewing the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice Roberts asked &quot;Is it the government&#x27;s submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than the citizens in the North?&quot;.   I&#x27;ve been there.   It totally is.  And the more rural, often the more racist (etc).<p>When you look at states where they are removing actual science from the textbooks, where are they?   When you find the populations of people that want to &quot;go with their gut&quot; in the face of any evidence, where are they concentrated?<p>Of course, you can&#x27;t paint with broad strokes - for me to condemn everyone in a low-population density area is just as wrong as calling them all saintly.  There are many people, many towns, many areas, where what I&#x27;m talking about is less common than in many cities.<p>But my experience says the embrace of ignorance to be more likely there.   I don&#x27;t look down on someone for coming from or being in a rural area.  I don&#x27;t admire someone for coming to or being in a city.  But the sort of &quot;noble savage&quot; picture that I&#x27;m seeing painted here utterly disregards the very real problems and social ills that many of these areas have.<p>Tell me your in&#x2F;from a rural area and I don&#x27;t care.  Tell me you&#x27;re poor, it doesn&#x27;t impact my impression of your worth as a person.  But don&#x27;t be an asshat and surround yourself with other asshats and then complain about the reputation you&#x27;re getting."

comment,14251637,,,1493767619,,gasbag,"&gt; In other news although we can harbor optimistic thoughts for scientists, medical professionals, lawmakers and maybe even politicians all around the globe to do the &quot;right&quot; thing to preserve human life in a currently recognizable form<p>Why is this the right thing to do?  What are you signifying by putting &quot;right&quot; in quotes?<p>I am reminded of the Hyperion Cantos from Dan Simmons, where most of the human race has declared that nanotech modification of the human organism&#x2F;germline is a cardinal sin.  Meanwhile there is another segment of humans who decided that maybe it wasn&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re off colonizing deep space by remaking themselves into a wild range of body types.<p>In fact if we don&#x27;t stop dirtying up the planet, we may feel a lot more pressure to adapt our bodies to an environment whose rate of change we can&#x27;t keep up with.  In any event I am sure there will be a segment of humanity that does want to preserve human life in a currently recognizable form, and they should be able to choose that for themselves.  That should not stop those of us who want to vary it wildly from doing our thing too!<p>There are a number of ethical concerns when it comes to these kinds of changes, of course.  There is the world of The Windup Girl, where competing agricorps target each other&#x27;s crops with tailored viruses to wipe them (or their consumers) out.  So we will need to figure out how to rebalance our societies in the light of this vast new power.  Yet it looks like it may also be the start of a whole new stage in treating human diseases.  Imagine a world where mass-produced medicines are mostly replaced by taking some host cells, gene sequencing the target diseases, then programming and re-injecting the cells to eliminate them.  I&#x27;m not well-versed enough in this stuff to know how far-fetched that is, of course.  It sounds like something out of Star Trek.

comment,14251604,,,1493767267,,ue_,"Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have said it so strongly. I will elaborate on my meaning.<p>Within capitalism, the labour of a working-class man is dictated usually by the capitalist; the hours he works, what he works with, when he works, and what quality of product is expected of him. However the labourer working under the capitalist is forced to sell the only thing he can provide - that is, his labour power (capacity to perform labour), and in return, the labourer receives a wage, which is equal to the exact amount required to sustain the worker and keep him within the labour force and introduce new labourers.<p>Thus in order to survive the labourer is required to sell his labour-time to someone else, and have the products of his labour appropriated at the end.<p>As is mentioned in Classical Econophysics (Paul W. Cockshott et al.):<p>&gt;Marx asked, where does profit come from, if all goods are exchanged at their value? The answer, Marx said, lies in the special commodity labour-power. The worker sells to the capitalist labour-power which embodies (let’s say) 5 hours; that is, the value of the worker’s means of subsistence amounts to 5 hours per day.  But once he gets through the factory gates or the or the door, he finds that the working day is 8 hours. The worker therefore performs 3 hours of ‘surplus labour’ per day and this is manifest in 3 hours’ worth of surplus value accruing to the capitalist.  Marx calls the labour time workers spend in reproducing the value of their wages the ‘necessary labour time’, and he calls the ratio of surplus labour time to necessary labour time at therate of surplus value. In the example just given the rate of surplus value is 3&#x2F;5 = 0.6.<p>So here we have one element of force: the forceful appropriation of one&#x27;s products of labour at the end of the production process. The next element of force is that the labourer is required to work under the direction of someone else, usually the highest bidder for the worker&#x27;s labur-power commodity (if he can find such a bidder), rather than voluntarily decide with others how much or how to work. And finally the third element of force, that the worker is required to work more in return for less, despite no <i>social</i> need to do so as a result of increased automation, which could be used to alleviate workload rather than increase short-term profits.<p>What are the exceptions? When a labourer is able to amass sufficient capital so as to sustain himself from it, or become a property owner himself. This not an option for most people, as it involves too much risk and time, especially for those with families."
comment,14251601,,,1493767241,,theossuary,"It really isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;d be trivial to allow mobile data to always supplement wifi data.  There are apps that do this already ([1] and [2]), and some phones have the option as well (either stock or as a ROM).  The problem are cellular data caps, nobody wants to blow their caps by using cellular when they could be using wifi only.  There is no way for wifi to know when you&#x27;re about to lose coverage, or have spotty coverage; the only way around it is to always have the mobile antenna connected to towers so it can take over.

    #&lt;STANDARD-METHOD COMMON-LISP-USER::ADD (NUMBER NUMBER) {1003ECEF53}&gt;

    CL-USER&gt; (defmethod add ((a string) (b string)) (concatenate &#x27;string a b))
    #&lt;STANDARD-METHOD COMMON-LISP-USER::ADD (STRING STRING) {1003FDC323}&gt;

    This works then:

    CL-USER&gt; (add 1 2)
    3

    Now this will get a runtime error, because there is no method for these arguments:

    CL-USER&gt; (add &quot;1&quot; 2)
</code></pre>
One can also declare types. For example that something is an integer or a subset of integers...<p><pre><code>    CL-USER&gt; (defun baz (a)
               (flet ((foo (a b)
                        (declare (integer a b))
                        (+ a b)))
                 (foo a &quot;b&quot;)))
</code></pre>
The SBCL compiler then complains, that above code has a type error:<p><pre><code>    ; in: DEFUN BAZ
    ;     (FOO A &quot;b&quot;)
    ; 
    ; caught WARNING:
    ;   Constant &quot;b&quot; conflicts with its asserted type INTEGER.
    ;   See also:
    ;     The SBCL Manual, Node &quot;Handling of Types&quot;</code></pre>"
comment,14251547,,,1493766707,,whyenot,"This is true of a lot of nature films as well. I got first hand experience of this working as a field biologist in Panama. We had several well known film crews come through where I worked. Trapped animals (temporarily captured for research reasons, it would be highly unethical to trap animals just to film them) were filmed in cages with natural looking backgrounds was common. Several segments involving larger animals were filmed at a local zoo. Insects were often &quot;tethered.&quot; A very thin clear plastic thread was glued to their bodies and attached to another surface so they could not fly again. One group wanted to film a tree fall in the forest, so they cut down a tree after attaching several cameras to it... It was an eye-opening experience for me."

There&#x27;s this really nice analogy about German and English languages, but it doesn&#x27;t have any specifics. In particular, the crux of his entire argument is in this statement<p>&gt; The two languages and their attendant communities have drifted so far apart that there is nothing of value in their intersection.<p>Which he simply states as fact without any sort of follow up or justification. And I disagree. Consider this Common Lisp snippet from Wikipedia computing the answer to the birthday paradox:<p><pre><code>  (defconstant +year-size+ 365)

  (defun birthday-paradox (probability number-of-people)
  (let ((new-probability (* (&#x2F; (- +year-size+ number-of-people)
                               +year-size+)
                            probability)))
    (if (&lt; new-probability 0.5)
        (1+ number-of-people)
        (birthday-paradox new-probability (1+ number-of-
  people)))))

</code></pre>
Literally replace &quot;defconstant&quot; with &quot;define&quot; and &quot;defun birthday-paradox (probability number-of-people)&quot; with &quot;define (birthday-paradox probability number-of-people)&quot; and that&#x27;s valid Scheme.<p>I&#x27;ll readily admit they are two different languages, but pretending they are as different as C and Python or something is absurd.<p>2. Even if you convince me these two languages are so different, there&#x27;s nothing here to convince me Common Lisp deserves the title of the &quot;real Lisp&quot; or &quot;true Lisp&quot;. Scheme can also run LISP code from 1960 with a very small driver."

In other words, rationality is not a feature of the individual choosers but of the market as a whole. Even if people make “mistakes” by not acting as the strict model would suggest, they will receive feedback from the competitive marketplace that will demonstrate their errors and give them the incentive and knowledge to correct them. Those who can recognize their biases and correct for them will do better than those who can’t, and markets enable us to do that when they are genuinely free and competitive. This is what Nobel laureate Vernon Smith calls “ecological rationality.” Even if individuals are irrational, the system as a whole produces rational outcomes.</i>"

But it hurts American citizens who are themselves low-skilled and poorly educated.<p>I know it&#x27;s not a popular opinion here, but I happen to think that US immigration policy should be crafted solely on what is in the US&#x27;s best interests. Allowing highly-skilled and highly educated people in helps the country, but I don&#x27;t really see how allowing a flood of low-skilled immigrants in helps the country in the larger picture.

The closing price on May 1, 2016 was $13.30. Even if the entire sale price was taxed, and assuming you&#x27;re already fairly wealthy, you&#x27;d need a marginal tax rate of well over 50%.

The States had a more &quot;right&quot; society founded om constitutional and civil rights that was a big part of its climb from an English colony to the world power in less than 150 years after the constitution was written.<p>The reason people probably have strong convictions about right or wrong is most likely <i>because</i> of nature, not despite it. Groups that had this genetic trait built tribes, societies  that had greater success in the long term.<p>In the short term, individuals, or even groups of individuals, can be successful by acting amorally, but this comes as a cost to their group&#x27;s long term success--the cancer analogy.<p>Right now there is limited competition between groups in the world.

comment,14251244,,,1493764275,,xiaoma,"Just my own personal feedback here: I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the site, but the Nathan Barry interview decreased my interest in the site a bit.<p>It&#x27;s because, for me personally, the thing that makes IH special is the stories of people who didn&#x27;t have degrees from elite schools, family wealth or VC funding and still successfully built something sufficient to cover their living expenses or even start hiring employees. Stories about people who do a lot with a little are a blueprint that can be applied by people of just about any background. Stories of parlaying medium-sized fortunes into large ones are most useful to people who already have medium-sized fortunes.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t dislike interviews with founders of large companies. I sometimes watch them on youtube and have read books about many of the largest tech companies. It&#x27;s just more useful for me to learn about how people went from 0 to 60 rather than from 60 to 200.<p>IH is still my favorite place on the internet for that, which is why I care about how well it serves that role.

Cheap, mass-produced, pre-prepared food (either frozen or in cans&#x2F;boxes) are the cheapest things to eat.

comment,14251238,,,1493764255,,kristianc,"The problem with any platform like Facebook (though Facebook happens to be have the richest seam

comment,14251085,,,1493762988,,valuearb,"It&#x27;s a good policy to buy back stock whenever you have excess cash flow and the stock is undervalued compared to your other investment options. An example might be your stock has a PE ratio of 8, so it&#x27;s yielding 12.5% and your other options look to yield 10% or less.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not saying IBM is right, or undervalued. If profits are falling a 12% yield might be a 6% yield before you know it, that&#x27;s why valuations are more complex than my simplistic example.

If you only plan to visit that one page, ever, then it&#x27;s not a great tradeoff (though 700kb -- no idea where you are getting 4MB from -- of images is basically nothing on a webpage these days). If you visit many discussions and many pages, it&#x27;s a win.<p>In other words a single discussion doesn&#x27;t need 4000 comments, you just need to read 4000 comments across all discussions all time. I&#x27;m not sure your math is correct here, either: I just visited meta.discourse.org in incognito mode and I see about.. 700kb of javascript?<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gPiEb"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gPiEb</a><p>I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t know where you are getting 4 megabytes out of 700kb.

If you are a &#x27;serious&#x27; programmer and you cannot do that task in under an hour, you better find your terrible teachers and give them a good talking to. Maybe try to steal their wallets or purses to get some of what they stole from you back. Graduating from any Univ.&#x2F;College (that is not Univ. of Phoenix style scum) should make that particular challenge not just able to be done in under an hour, but it should make you laugh at how <i>easy</i> it is. Yes, easy. Binary is learned in the first month (or less) of any &#x27;good&#x27; department&#x27;s curriculum and should be considered to be the same as PEMDAS is to Algebra in terms of foundational knowledge. I cannot imagine how any teacher not just nakedly after your Pell grant money could ever skip it. What next, will people complain that knowing the difference between and &#x27;int&#x27; and &#x27;str&#x27; is too difficult to recall? Are pointers too tough? If your comp-sci program did not teach you what binary is, you better go get another degree, because your current one was just theft. Yes, Google, StackOverflow, all that jazz. I get it and do it myself too. But good lord, not being able to code that in under an hour should be <i>embarrassing</i>.

comment,14250917,,,1493761500,,FiatLuxDave,"Short answer: Yes.<p>Longer answer: When I first read it, I didn&#x27;t think that the limitation that he had proposed applied to the type of device that we were making.  He was really criticizing a similar but-not-identical type of fusion concept, and I clung to the differences.  However, as our work progressed, I saw that the basic concept applied, which is that the scattering which would occur in a plasma (or a beam) would dissipate the energy concentration faster than the fusion rate would compensate.  In short, a beam would thermalize with its surrounding plasma at an energy rate faster than the fusion rate.<p>We looked at using van de Meer beam cooling to try to keep the beam in a highly collimated state which would reduce the thermalization rate, but this wouldn&#x27;t work.  We also tried using Landau damping to make self-reinforcing waves that could, in theory, keep the energy concentration, but this really didn&#x27;t work."

comment,14250767,,,1493760242,,Naveg,"Alloy | San Francisco, CA and Vancouver, BC | Full-time, Onsite | <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alloy.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alloy.ai</a><p>Over $20 trillion worth of goods are manufactured, transported, and sold each year - the things we use, wear and eat every day. The global supply chain is one the world&#x27;s largest economic engines.<p>The manufacturers, distributors, brands, and retailers that make up this complex network struggle to track and respond to supply and demand as their products travel from production to consumer. Those who try rely on 40-year-old data standards, lots of manual Excel work, and hordes of human middleware.<p>Alloy is an end-to-end supply chain visibility platform that provides the first comprehensive, low-latency view of demand and inventory across all distribution channels. Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing businesses to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand. We tie all of this information together with smart notifications that help get products to the right place at the right time.<p>We are post-revenue, well funded by leading VCs, and growing rapidly, with large contracts from some of the world&#x27;s most recognisable brands. Our small team has diverse backgrounds and experience in analytics, large-scale enterprise SaaS, and retail and financial technology. Culture really matters to us: we value diversity in all forms and strive to foster integrity, respect, and open communication.<p>We use Google Cloud Platform, Postgres, Redis, Python, modern Java, and React, all wrapped in beautiful design.<p>== About You ==<p>You thrive in a small team where you can build technology from the ground up. You love to pick up new tech, master it quickly, and do something creative with it.<p>You don’t shy away from even the most challenging problems and are relentless in always looking for better solutions. You are self-motivated and enjoy working with others towards a common objective. Building software is the means to an end: you want to change the way an entire industry operates.<p>As an engineer at Alloy, you’ll do any or all of the following:<p>* Model parts of the supply chain and develop features that bring them together<p>* Automate the collection, parsing, and storage of huge volumes of data<p>* Design a flexible but blazing-fast analytics framework that powers instant insights<p>* Build beautiful, easy-to-use applications that our customers love to use<p>* Dive into server provisioning, deployment, automation, and monitoring<p>We would love to hear from you - send me a note at evan@alloy.ai"

They both collapsed in the dot-com crash.<p>I am not sure why they failed but more recent attempts seem to be succeeding. My two current theories are:
1. They were ahead of their time. There weren&#x27;t enough people shopping on the Internet to sustain them back then.
2. They were killed by structural obstacles that may also kill the new versions."

But you can have macros without sexps, and sexps without macros (lots of &quot;toy lisp interpreters&quot; do that), are they LISPs?

In the US, the company pays for it all, and on top of it perhaps around $2,000 a month for a family health insurance policy for that employee so they can get the birth and emergency care paid for. Again, this is mostly free outside the US. You&#x27;re hitting up on some societal grade rather than company policy issues. I feel you though, being from the UK and living in the US, it is just insanity. So little care for mothers and parents."

comment,14250551,,,1493758933,,gambiting,"I have a full alcantara steering wheel in my Mercedes AMG. It&#x27;s awful, and AMG Private Lounge forums will tell you the same story, it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to literally go and swap their alcantara-clad wheels in their $100k vehicles for normal leather. Initially it feels amazing when the car is brand new, but you need to keep cleaning it every month or otherwise it becomes this dirty clump of neither pleasant leather, nor smooth material, it&#x27;s just unpleasant to touch - and after a certain point it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you clean it, it just looks like an old rag and the only thing you can do is have the wheel re-done. Having a laptop covered in alcantara sounds like the worst idea ever, probably only a notch better than having shiny black piano plastic on surfaces which scratch from just looking at them."

I put a lot of stock in the importance of having a &quot;mentor&quot; early in my career. And I lamented the lack of being able to find one.<p>I eventually changed gears – different job in a different field – and found someone I consider to be a mentor. The most interesting part is that instead of this person being someone I want to be exactly like or even someone that I share a great deal in common with, I just find myself trying to do what I think they would do in situations I am faced with. It&#x27;s the way they handle themselves, communicate with others, make decisions, etc.<p>So I would just say be involved in as many things as possible and be open-minded. Ideally you will share a lot in common and be in the same field. But I don&#x27;t think that has to be the case."

comment,14250512,,,1493758689,,character0,"Is the problem you are describing that CRISPR antiviral therapies aren&#x27;t effective because you don&#x27;t usually know that you&#x27;ve been infected until, well, after you&#x27;ve been infected?<p>The way I understand the problem is that the lag time can be rather long, and it&#x27;s always long enough for the virus to get a good running start. Symptoms, after all, don&#x27;t occur until things are well under way. So in the real world, the two opportunities for antiviral therapies are (1) something that you can take long before you&#x27;re even exposed, and that lasts for a long time (like a vaccine) or (2) something that you can take after you&#x27;ve already realized that you&#x27;re sick (like an antiviral drug).<p>It seems like the DRACO proteins fall in between these two unless something has changed since the last time I read about this in, I believe, 2012."

comment,14250491,,,1493758551,,e1g,"&gt; please recognize the determination it takes to make it that far<p>&gt; ...it&#x27;s easier to get hired as female engineer because of diversity quotas...<p>I had seen both of these play out through my partner. She was consistently invited to interview for positions significantly ahead of her experience at the time. She declined these offers on ethical grounds, but it did seem that the surface area of opportunities was expanded because to her gender and age.<p>Conversely, when she did choose a new role well within her bulletproof expertise, she would be systematically harassed and undermine by otherwise well-meaning people. For example, she&#x27;s had a dotted-line manager suggest a threesome (in writing, over WhatsApp), offers to work from the client&#x27;s office because &quot;we need a girl there&quot; (this would make the company look better), and changes to her briefings to sound &quot;...maybe less you&quot; (she had spent years doing conflict resolutions and suicide hotline counseling).<p>Both points can be true at the same time: women in tech (or finance, or law, or consulting) may have more options presented, but almost none of them are healthy. Working as a female seems to provide the same advantages as going out as a disabled - yes, you have special parking offers and can get to the front door quicker, but no-one will swap places with you."

comment,14250443,,,1493758188,,civilian,"I don&#x27;t want to believe that it&#x27;s an article of faith for me :) I&#x27;ve heard convincing arguments for it, and the arguments against market monopolies haven&#x27;t ever been satisfying. But, I also haven&#x27;t taken a survey of all monopolies or wannabe-monopolies in history. Yeah, my view on monopolies comes from the base assumption that: &quot;It&#x27;s never cost-effective to try to interfere with the competition by either buying them out or by a price war.&quot; The awesome American example of it is from Dow Chemical vs. Bromkonvention (short description: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;09&#x2F;dow-chemical-bromine-monopoly.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;09&#x2F;dow-chemical-brom...</a> ) and this is a longwinded account in favor of Standard Oil (and to be honest, I&#x27;m jumping around in the article as I&#x27;m reading it): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theobjectivestandard.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2008-summer&#x2F;standard-oil-company&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theobjectivestandard.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2008-summer&#x2F;stan...</a><p>For &quot;buying out the competition&quot;, the idea is that: If company A with market dominance wants to maintain market dominance by buying out the competition, it&#x27;ll always come at a bad deal. People who are starting new companies that do the same thing will be able to hold out for a price that makes selling worth it, which probably means that it&#x27;s a bad deal for company A.<p>At the same time, the person running the upstart company B can stay in business if they&#x27;re willing to take fewer profits. Company A should be making lots of profits, if they have economies of scale. But if Company A takes any more profit than the difference in the benefit of having an economy of scale, then there is an opening to a competitor.  If we start with Profit=Revenue-Cost &#x2F; P = R - C, then if (Pa - Pb) &gt; CostReductionFromHavingAnEconomyOfScale, then there is space for a small competitor to come in and make some profit.<p>Sorry for going on that tangent--- I know that wasn&#x27;t your main objection, but I wanted to back up my assumptions.<p>The &quot;misleading advertising&quot; is a new angle I haven&#x27;t thought of too much, but I would hope that consumers and organizations like Consumer Reports would be able to cut through the bullshit and get the product that&#x27;s actually the best value. And I feel like, with the pervasiveness of aggressive advertising&#x2F;marketing, most people, especially people who guide purchasing decisions in households &amp; businesses, are able to look at it with a sharper eye. Not always an accurate eye, but sharp enough to be somewhat guided towards the direction of better value.  The way that this applies to the recent election is that I think the effect of &quot;fake news&quot; is pretty overblown."

comment,14250437,,,1493758152,,bhauer,"I&#x27;m somewhat ambivalent on text size since I typically zoom web content when I find the text size uncomfortable.  There are some cases where there is a severe mismatch between the size of body&#x2F;text and other elements, which poses a challenge for zoom.  But for the most part, zoom is a sufficient tool.<p>Still, I could potentially agree with the overall sentiment that slighter larger default sizing might be good.<p>But I find the presentation of this argument ironic thanks to poor body contrast:<p><pre><code>    background-color: white;
    color: rgb(60, 72, 88);

Pulling the body color numbers down to increase the contrast made it immensely more readable for me.  Unfortunately, while browsers have decent zoom controls, they don&#x27;t have contrast controls without plugins.  So designers should be especially careful to not specify insufficient contrast.

My parents&#x27; house looks out south across a wooded valley at this ridiculously picturesque ridge of rolling, almost perfectly rounded hills.

comment,14250371,,,1493757718,,ezyjules,"I&#x27;m pretty immersed in the field of parental leave benefits in the US and UK, having setup Pledge Parental Leave www.pledgepl.org. Important to get the full perspective on the market in the US. You&#x27;re taking a crap on a company with extremely progressive benefits across the board, furthermore so, one offering them at a &#x27;meager&#x27; size of 50, where the relative cost is much greater than compared to a &#x27;large&#x27; company.<p>It is very easy to make simple comparisons between UK and European standards vs US standards. The fact is that there is almost zero government funding&#x2F;support for parental leave in the US. The US is the only developed country in the world without any government mandated parental leave standards.<p>What Basecamp offer in terms of paid leave to either parent is top tier in the US. If you take a look at Facebook, Google and others they offer close to similar benefits - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1Ibj79Eh8Cvk4Wy_dPZNc19894N8zcQNgYem0K4EWrAg&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1Ibj79Eh8Cvk4Wy_dPZNc...</a><p>In the US, any company stepping up in this area is doing so of its own volition and cost - again the government gives a company zero funding. In the UK, German, Sweden etc they pick up most of the tab of extended leave. In the US, the only form of support is for mothers through expensive health insurance for the &#x27;disability&#x27; of having a child. So before you engage in moral relativism, it&#x27;s healthy to get the context and the facts.

No one needs context-sensitive grammars. I think designing a language that cannot be parsed with an LL(1) or LALR parser is just dumb. It guarantees that your compiler will be slow right from the start. In addition that applies to all the tooling - syntax highlighting and navigation in the editor, linters, pretty-printers, etc. And in practice the tooling is not just slow but also has a ton of bugs around corner cases."

comment,14250356,,,1493757605,,jsmthrowaway,"&gt; Where I get frustrated with ops is when they forget that they&#x27;re in the service business. They&#x27;re there to serve application developers in the same way that the application developers are there to serve customers. An application developer pushing back at a customer ask with the line, &quot;without really stopping to ask what progress is from the perspective of developers&quot; would be rightly lampooned. And yet somehow there&#x27;s people that think the ops mindset is reasonable. In my view, &quot;no&quot; is not a valid viewpoint. Application developers are telling you they want the kind of functionality that Docker offers. That makes it your job to figure out how that happens, not if it happens.<p>Nope, nope, nope, <i>nope.</i> I quoted this entire paragraph at length because it&#x27;s all just completely wrong.<p>Read <i>Site Reliability Engineering</i> that Google just published for an alternative perspective. SRE at Google is <i>specifically and vocally</i> organized to have authority to push back on engineering. Without exception. &quot;No&quot; is absolutely a valid viewpoint, particularly when you&#x27;re asking a team to go on call for your code. It&#x27;s not you sleeping in the guest bedroom and fucking up a marriage, now is it? No, it&#x27;s us. Let&#x27;s reframe this: you are responsible for software. I am responsible for production, which happens to run your software along with, likely, a bunch of other things that you don&#x27;t know about. You said in another comment that operations exists solely to abstract infrastructure for developer consumption, which is such a heavy marginalization of what we do that I&#x27;m amazed you even identify yourself as an operator of any kind.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this to be an impediment to you. Both our paychecks flow from the same mission. I just need the authority to push back when your decisions threaten production (<i>especially</i> when you don&#x27;t understand why). It&#x27;s contrived, but on one end of the spectrum, if you said let&#x27;s rewrite the stack in ColdFusion, it&#x27;s not my job to figure out how to enable you. It&#x27;s my job to figure out how to keep the lights on, and defending that properly means investing absolutely zero in your ColdFusion rewrite. Escalate to my management if you choose; if it comes down to the ColdFusion rewrite or my continued leadership of operations, I&#x27;ll go somewhere else. So the more you ask operators to be &quot;yes people&quot; for engineers, the more you end up with operations outsourced to Tata and Infosys -- who will say yes to everything you want. Have fun with that.<p>Seriously, operations will be the equivalent of COBOL consulting by 2030. Just wait. I&#x27;ll hit my mid-40s, pull a Mikey Dickerson, and build a consultancy to swoop in and clean up the mess that you&#x27;re creating by marginalizing operations as strongly as you are and laugh <i>all the way to the bank.</i><p>Particularly in SRE, I&#x27;m a software engineer who happens to enjoy the plumbing that keeps your code running. I do not exist to serve at the pleasure of application developers, nor do I accept any imagery of my being inferior because I don&#x27;t spend my days writing red&#x2F;black trees to shave a few milliseconds off the news feed. I can, and have, do&#x2F;done SRE without a single application developer customer, and I like to think of SRE as a little bit better than application engineering: you push to a repo and wait. I push Enter and 10,000 things happen instantly. Who&#x27;s having more fun?<p>Tossing lame code over the fence is how to sow bad seeds with operations. That you&#x27;ve then had negative experiences with operations, enough to generalize us as a species (are you hitting sysadmins? ops? sysops? devops? hwops? netops? SRE?), is only a reinforcement for that to me. I would say between a combination of educated guessing based on your opinion, prior experience, and a few other inputs that it&#x27;s pretty likely that your gripes with operations stem from flawed expectations on your part."
comment,14250353,,,1493757578,,xorcist,"I just want to add to that, just to offer a perspective that people not concerned with the upkeep of software always realize: In the general case, when you keep software around for long some bugs will linger. But as long as the issues are well known that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.<p>Sometimes you have to work around some corner case or performance anomaly in another layer. You don&#x27;t want to apply fixes to underlying software willy-nilly without first re-evaluating what you did.<p>So sometimes stable distributions will avoid fixing bugs for good reason. (That doesn&#x27;t go for security issues, of course.) And if that&#x27;s not what you want most distributions have a more suitable branch for you."

comment,14250338,,,1493757476,,theseoafs,"Linear types = &quot;you must use this value exactly one time&quot;
Affine (uniqueness) types = &quot;you can use this value either zero or one times, but you can&#x27;t use it more than once&quot;<p>As an example, compare two languages: one with linear types and one with affine types.  Let&#x27;s say that you had a &quot;File&quot; type, a function &quot;open()&quot; that creates a file (either linear or affine as appropriate), and a function &quot;close()&quot; that consumes the file.  Then this code would be legal in both languages with linear types and languages with affine types:<p><pre><code>    let f: File = open()
    close(f)
</code></pre>
Note that &quot;f&quot; is used once and only once, at which point the value is consumed.  In a language with affine types, this is also kosher:<p><pre><code>    let f: File = open()
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Do nothing
</code></pre>
This fails to compile in the language with linear types because &quot;f&quot; is never used.  Finally, this code is never legal in either language:<p><pre><code>    let f: File = open()
    close(f)
    close(f)
</code></pre>
... because &quot;f&quot; is used twice here, and neither linear types nor affine types allow that.<p>So affine types give you a little more leeway."

comment,14250293,,,1493757088,,SwellJoe,"I grew up in the deep south, and my folks were the first generation in my family to move out of the trailer park (technically, their parents lived in mill villages, which was a similar indicator of poverty, but the first several years of their marriage was spent in a trailer). They made it out before I was born, so I had a lower middle class upbringing most of my life. Many of my friends were in the same situation; their folks bought houses and moved out of trailers during their childhood. There was a general trend upward, out of the trailer park and into middle class lifestyles.<p>What&#x27;s alarming, to me, is that <i>many</i> of those same friends are back in trailer parks, or slumlord-run apartments, today. The trend today is pushing people down and out of the middle class and back into poverty. Poor folks could scrabble their way out of poverty through the 70s to early 90s, even though we don&#x27;t regard all of that time as a &quot;good economy&quot;, my recollection was that the average family was coming up, rather than falling down. That doesn&#x27;t seem to be working anymore.<p>The numbers seem to agree with this: the American middle class is shrinking. Some are climbing up into the upper class, but I suspect that&#x27;s mostly people who never knew poverty. I think past poverty has a gravity that pulls folks back down, if anything goes awry.<p>Health problems have been a leading indicator among my old friends. When people get sick in America, it can be an economic disaster. Less so with ACA, but it&#x27;s still too much if you&#x27;re barely hanging onto your house, your car, etc.<p>I live in RV parks quite a bit these days, as I live in an RV and travel kinda full-time (in a leisurely manner, after many years of constant travel), and I meet a lot of people who are &quot;choosing&quot; to live a more minimal lifestyle in an RV. But, the reality is, they often don&#x27;t have the option to live in a house; at least not one they own. The Tiny House movement seems to be a lot of the same: people who can&#x27;t afford a traditional suburban home, but still have dreams of home ownership. I see the Tiny House &quot;movement&quot; being criticized a lot as &quot;fetishizing poverty&quot;, but I think that misses the point that a lot of the people choosing to live in Tiny Houses aren&#x27;t fetishizing being poor...they&#x27;re just poor. They come from middle class backgrounds, so people just don&#x27;t recognize it as poverty.<p>I worry that the economic divide in the US is a disaster waiting to happen for the country as a whole, but it&#x27;s already causing significant pain among the people who come from a poor background and don&#x27;t have family safety net to help lift them back up, when things go wrong. They just keep falling, and trailer parks, RV parks, slumlord-run apartments, etc., is where they end up. And, getting back out again is harder than it&#x27;s been in a long time."

comment,14250251,,,1493756773,,YCode,"It is a little off-putting, but I think it certainly has its place in educating and entertaining people about wildlife.<p>BBC&#x27;s Hidden Kingdoms comes to mind, where they make no illusions about the fact that you are watching a film not a camera left out in the woods for ten days.<p>In fact, after each episode they double down and re-use all their work by showing you just how they got the shots and set up all the scenes.<p>That, and I think Planet Earth has occasionally been guilty of what you&#x27;re talking about, but personally I&#x27;ve never felt insulted, more like impressed they managed to make a palatable narrative out of a bunch of wildlife scenes."
comment,14250248,,,1493756770,,patio11,"It is my anecdotal impression that this is common in some European countries.<p>Japanese leave policies are historically pretty simple: the government says you get X weeks, buuuuut X is an inconvenient number for us, so you probably want to look around the room and conform to the practices of your coworkers, which are closer to Y days.  Also, for you ladies: remember that the traditional expectation is that you have unlimited maternity leave when you leave formal employment after marrying or having a child.  (Some re-enter when the child goes to school. This is largely not compatible with career advancement, with rare exceptions like e.g. translation&#x2F;interpretation.)"

comment,14250224,,,1493756610,,ianamartin,"SQL was my entry point into software development, and I have a somewhat emotional attachment to it. And I&#x27;m quite glad that it worked that way.<p>SQL, relational theory, and set theory are a great place to start understanding how to work with data. And a great way to start understanding software.<p>All software deals with data. If you don&#x27;t have a good understanding of data, you are never going to have a good understanding of software.<p>One of the best books I&#x27;ve ever read was Applied Mathematics for Database Professionals by Lex de Haan, and Toon Koppelaars. I think that&#x27;s the database equivalent of SICP. You need to read it and understand it if you want to seriously deal with data. And you want to if you want to write software.<p>I&#x27;m obviously biased because of the way I got into things, but I look at things as a top-down vs a bottom-up point of view. I was a violinist and music theorist before I got into technology, and the bottom-up approach has always resonated with me.<p>In classical music, pretty much everything bubbles up from a baseline foundation and a structure; the stuff at the top that you actually see is a result of that structure. You don&#x27;t start with some notes that you want to play on an instrument and then go and try to find a structure that supports those notes. You go bottom-up. You lay the foundation and build on that.<p>It was easy for me to map that idea of musical theory onto a database early in my career. And I moved up in the stack as I needed to. I started by building things entirely in SQL. You want complex statistical analysis? Sure, I&#x27;ll do that . . . in SQL. Because I didn&#x27;t know any better.<p>Then I found out that there are actually other languages that can do certain types of things much better. R, Python, C#, etc.<p>11 years later, I&#x27;m now very capable in a number of languages, and I don&#x27;t suck. Along the way, I&#x27;ve had to put a lot of effort into learning the things I would have got from a comp sci degree program, and I&#x27;m probably not the best at certain types of software challenges.<p>I use noSQL stuff for caches and data warehouses, I use some of that for offloading traffic and keeping the reads separate from the writes. But there isn&#x27;t a project that I touch that doesn&#x27;t involve SQL in some way.<p>SQL is incredibly useful every day. Learning it, knowing it, understanding it, is a bare minimum for people I hire.<p>If you have a comp sci degree, and you don&#x27;t know SQL, I&#x27;m going to probably write you off. If you have a liberal arts degree of some kind, and you do know SQL, I&#x27;m probably going to hire. You can learn everything else on the job.<p>None of that is an excuse for the totally shitty article linked here.<p>We use SQL today because it&#x27;s good and it works. Not many languages can say that these days."

Basically given the same papers, the number of corrections and comments was significantly higher when the papers had names of minorities or something. That kind of ironically proves that it&#x27;s beneficial to hire more women given the same qualifications, doesn&#x27;t it? haha. People would look at women&#x27;s code much more carefully and there will be fewer bugs in the end. I personally had a few cases where I just copied an approach of some guy (e.g. using a certain library that a similar application was using) but I had to change that during the code review. I mentioned this and had to change his code as well. How did he get through this rigorous code review in the first place? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe people found him more trust-worthy and assumed his work was perfect. :&#x2F;"

comment,14250200,,,1493756454,,HeyLaughingBoy,"Your last bit really spoke to me.<p>I live on a small farm, on a hilltop with an amazing view. After 10+ years, I barely ever notice the view unless it&#x27;s something spectacular like sundogs on a clear, -10F morning, or the sun rising above a blanket of early summer fog. I only think about the location when the howling winter wind keeps us awake for hours or the hail batters the roof and windows during a summer thunderstorm.<p>But vistors see it differently. The first comment after walking in the front door and facing the big window is &quot;your view is beautiful.&quot;<p>Even though I rarely notice it, I know I&#x27;m so addicted to the casual natural beauty around me that I could never leave. It&#x27;s kind of a scary thought that I can probably never be happy living in a city again."

I&#x27;m not sure, but I don&#x27;t think that would be something rare to have you account suspended. Perhaps, if you arrive a some type of agreement with them and their &quot;business model&quot; is compatible wit that, maybe.

comment,14250176,,,1493756315,,briandear,"Perhaps some data to back that up? Some of the best restaurants and chefs in the world are American. Have you been to an American grocery store of any reasonable quality? The cheese selection of many big-city grocery stores rivals even French grocery stores. I shop in France all the time and I am still amazed at the variety at many American grocery stores. Try finding Napa&#x2F;Chinese cabbage, fresh chiles, daikon radish or any number of ethnic staples in a typical French grocery store -- its very difficult. I love my local grocery store but for sheer variety, American wins big.<p>This tired trope about Americans eating so much processed food is often passed around by people that seem to not be very familiar with what grocery stores in the rest of the world sell. The French have entire stores dedicated to pre-packaged, frozen meals. Stereotypes are often based in truth, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are true.<p>Your average American grocery store has the ingredients to make almost any cuisine on earth, yet I have to import tortilla flour from the US because the only thing resembling Mexican food in France is &quot;Old El Paso.&quot; Korean ingredients? Good luck with that. There&#x27;s a tired section of soy sauces that consist of Kikkoman generic crap and that&#x27;s about it. In a US store, I can find at at least 5 different kinds of soy sauces. Actual Asian noodles as well.<p>People seem to have a hobby bashing Americans, yet the American grocery store is a temple to the success of capitalism, world trade and diversity.<p>Ever been to a &quot;non-capitalist&quot; grocery store in China? Once you do that, then perhaps you could opine on how bad capitalism is for food.<p>Capitalism is the very reason you can find enoki mushrooms in Omaha, habaneros in Minnesota or Serbian rakija in Los Angeles.<p>I am not saying that Americans always make the best nutritional choices -- but it isn&#x27;t due to the lack of opportunity to do so."

More seriously, since urls that need shortened are typically over 140 chars and contain random data, huffman coding isn&#x27;t efficient enough. I do think some sort of predictable shortening algorithm would be much better than the current system of link databases that die though so this idea does have some merits but not sure trying to compress like this will work on the urls you need to shorten the most."

comment,14250107,,,1493755751,,brianberns,"&gt;&gt; 1 - All those parenthesis. (Still a top objection)<p>&gt; If you actually count parens fairly you will find that Lisp has no more than any other language<p>Bull. For example, compare the Lisp factorial function from the article:<p><pre><code>    (define (fact x)
      (if (zero? x)
          1
          (* x (fact (- x 1)))))
</code></pre>
with the corresponding F# implementation:<p><pre><code>    let rec fact x =
        if x = 0 then 1
        else x * fact (x - 1)
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s 7 vs. 1 pair of parens.<p>Also, the problem isn&#x27;t just that Lisp has so many parens, but that they nest so deeply and quickly. Five nested levels of parens for factorial alone."
comment,14250104,,,1493755730,,sbierwagen,"The expensive part of getting a drug to market isn&#x27;t proving that it can kill cells in a petri dish. Lots of stuff can do that, bleach, hydrogen peroxide...<p>The expensive part is the clinical trial. You try out the compound in the chemical woodchipper that is the human body, and see what happens. Almost all drugs fail at this point: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;i-do-hate-to-tell-you-this-but"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;i-d...</a><p>&gt;The timing of this report from the FDA is surely no accident, but it’s always a good time to think about this: the great majority of all drugs that enter clinical trials fail. They fail because they don’t do anyone any good, or because what good they might do is outweighed by some serious and unexpected harm. Around 90% of all compounds that start in the clinic never make it out. Even by the time you get to Phase III – and these are drugs that have apparently already worked in sick patients by that point – the failure rate is still nearly 40%. Drug projects fail constantly.<p>Nobody can predict if a drug will make it through the clinic, and if they say they can, they&#x27;re lying. There&#x27;s no way to model it, at all, it&#x27;s just hugely computationally intractable.<p>And even if you make it through the first three formal phases of clinical trial, you can get bit in the &quot;fourth&quot; phase: regular patients buying it retail, and maybe dying at statistically higher rates.

It was marketed by Merck &amp; Co. to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions, and dysmenorrhea. Rofecoxib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 20, 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx.<p>&gt;On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib&#x27;s risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease.[2] Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx.[3] Merck reserved $970 million to pay for its Vioxx-related legal expenses through 2007, and has set aside $4.85bn for legal claims from US citizens.<p>VC&#x27;s could spend hundreds of millions on clinical trials for DRACO, make it on the market... and only then discover that it gives patients incurable brain cancer 20 years after they take it."

comment,14250080,,,1493755565,,VLM,"Maybe the urban poor are completely invisible.  It was a collection of stories about poor people that we&#x27;re told are rural but like bad soft sci fi the setting didn&#x27;t matter a bit.<p>I grew up with&#x2F;near rural people, and will probably retire to the country, and I&#x27;ll tell you four anecdotes that are genuinely specifically rural, although not necessarily poor:<p>1) Rural folk understand balance sheet vs income statement like urbanites don&#x27;t.  There are a lot of people who suffer from being land poor, where they own the land but struggle to finance day to day operations on and for that land.  Life can be complicated when your septic tank breaks and all you have for income is SS and it would take 15 years of SS payments to pay someone else for a new septic system even if you had no other expenses for those 15 years ... also consider prop tax for example.  If you own the land there is no building superintendent and the closest urban contractor is a 2 hour truck charge drive away, so you make do as best you and your neighbors can.  There&#x27;s a lot of rural paper millionaires who can&#x27;t afford to fix their rusty truck.<p>2) Rural folk, unless they live in the upper midwest and therefore speak newscaster English accent, are generally not terribly interested in your opinion of their accent or the stereotype you think it implies.  You think you&#x27;re holier than thou because you&#x27;re not from rural Louisiana, how nice, but sorry we don&#x27;t care at all.  Sort of like the stereotype of poorly socialized rural folk trying to save your soul, that&#x27;s how we look at poorly socialized urbanites trying to &quot;save us&quot; from the wilderness that is our home.  How cute, you came here to tell us we&#x27;re doing it wrong, that&#x27;s so funny, come back when you grow up.<p>3) Some rural folk are very lonely because you have to spend a significant amount of money on gas to drive a couple dozen miles to do anything.  The phone is nice, but as you know a fraction of the population has an uncontrollable urge for physical presence.  Those folks, especially the old ones, have a rough time, especially when their local peers die off and they literally can&#x27;t afford to visit whoever is left.  There is a filtration effect such that the survivors are the type who can be alone without being lonely, but as its a spectrum there will be lonely people, although not as many as if urbanites were air dropped into the wilderness.  Almost stereotypical for a new teen driver, who&#x27;s parents can afford it, to be assigned to drive old uncle whatshisname all over the place.  Unlike urbanites this leads to rural youth learning much younger that old people have wisdom, or at least respectably interesting stories.<p>4) Rural areas are beautiful.  Urbanites don&#x27;t understand because they live without beauty, somehow.  No one ever daydreamed about seeing the grease trap at McDonalds back by the overflowing dumpster on a crisp winter morning.  Or watching the daily migration of the homeless as the wind blows trash past them down the street.  Or inhaling diesel bus fumes on a hot summer afternoon.  Living in beauty is in itself an addiction that is hard to shake, hard as a chemical addiction, leaving urbanites very confused about why ruralites don&#x27;t want to move into town and live in a nice gray soviet style apartment building where they can&#x27;t even see the sun and the closest green plant is miles away.  Sorta like asking, &quot;so... why not just stop shooting heroin&quot; its not quite that simple to break an addiction...  If you live essentially in a national park your whole life its very difficult to get people like that to leave."

comment,14250074,,,1493755537,,stickfigure,"While our population concentrates on the coast, IIRC on balance it still ends up being about a 50-50 split depending on how generously you want to define &quot;coast&quot;. Also, the demographic trend is people moving towards coastal cities, so a large portion of current coastal city dwellers established their taste preferences growing up inland.<p>Geography is certainly a plausible component of the answer. But I personally think cultural norms are pretty arbitrary and self-sustaining; there doesn&#x27;t need to be a deeper reason why &quot;americans like beef&quot; other than our parents did and that&#x27;s what we grew up with (recurse N generations)."

The IoT stuff is usually cobbled together components, so we&#x27;ll see things like a 500gig HD on a device (such as an environmental sensor for a city intersection) that passes off data and at most needs a couple gigs for OS and cache stuff. It&#x27;s harder to start installing stuff on devices that are at the minimum specs for what they are designed to do.

comment,14249924,,,1493754660,,dsr_,"So you&#x27;ve got 6 people and want to have 8.<p>There&#x27;s a big problem with being on call for one week out of 6 or 8: you lose touch with the procedures. Sure, your four year veterans know everything by heart - but the first few shifts of a newbie are going to be perilous. I recommend making the shifts shorter and more frequent.<p>Presumably one person is on-call and everyone else can be called in &#x2F; woken up as necessary. So - split each day into two halves, and ask people to be on-call for a 12 hour period.<p>Rotate the roster around so that Jane doesn&#x27;t always have the same Friday-afternoon shift, nobody has 2 shifts in a row, and put it in a shared calendar so you can always see who has the watch.<p>With 6 people, you&#x27;ll take 2 and a seventh shifts per week. At 7, it&#x27;s an even 2 shifts per week.<p>Benefits:<p>- much less of a burden that a whole week of readiness<p>- brains work better when they haven&#x27;t been pummeled for a week at a time (at least, mine does)<p>- easily scales fairly when you have more people, or when someone leaves, but keeps everyone in the loop. When you have 14 people in Ops, you only have one shift a week, but you get one every week.<p>- much more family-friendly<p>OK, why 2 12 hour periods instead of splitting the day into 8, 6 or 4? Because people lose track too easily. Trying to schedule around your kid&#x27;s concert or music lessons with smaller chunks is hard to keep in your head - and trying to work that in with a one week shift is nigh-impossible.<p>Why not a 24 hour shift? Because it&#x27;s really hard to recover from that. Humans are generally awake for about 15-17 hours a day. Shifting a few hours is generally doable.<p>I would recommend that for anyone who took an alert call during non-core hours, you automatically expect them to take the next normal day to recover. I know that when I get woken up at 4AM,  I&#x27;ll run out of steam by 2 or 3PM."

comment,14249729,,,1493753173,,cryptonector,"Whether Paulson (or anyone else) stands to profit from this is kinda besides the point.  The critical thing is that Frannie not return to the status they had before: somewhat privately-owned but with strongly implied Federal government bailout guarantees.  That had a lot to do with the real estate bubble (and its inevitable crash).  We don&#x27;t need a re-run of that movie.<p>A privatization of Frannie that involves removing the conditions that led to the bubble, including removing the bailout guarantees, would be a fair policy.  However, I believe this will require legislation that Congress will have no appetite for, and which may not be able to pass in the Senate due to filibustering.  We should definitely oppose half-measures in this respect; 2008 was too painful to replay."

comment,14249660,,,1493752756,,gumby,"This could be simply familiarity.  Back in the 80s I wrote a large system (100s of Kloc) in Common Lisp (Cyc) and it was clear and easy to follow...for a Lisp programmer.<p>I don&#x27;t say &quot;familiarity&quot; as some sort of insult.  I find human-generated Lisp, Forth, Postscript, and TECO clear.  I find APL code impenetrable, but I know my APL-using friends (well, some Well Street variant) find it as clear as a bell.  And machine-generated C code is, well, opaque.<p>Now what I like about the lisp syntax is precisely what (if I understand you correctly) don&#x27;t: it fades into the background so I can concentrate on the algorithm.  This means the C&#x2F;C++ code (mostly C++ these days) I write for myself or in my small workgroup is visually unlike traditional style guides:<p><pre><code>    node*
    foo(node&amp; first, node&amp; last){
      if(first_fails_qualifier(first))         return nullptr; 
      if(last_fails_qualifier(last)  )         return nullptr;
      if(!some_other_precondition(first, last) return nullptr;

      ...do some processing on the args...

      return (wanted_first_p() ? &amp;first : &amp;last);
    }
</code></pre>

I see no reason why that would cease to be true even in a world without government (although government is certainly a frequent collaborator in such interference.)<p>And I&#x27;m not talking about heinous interference, like bombing your competitor&#x27;s factory. Even misleading advertising can often do the trick. Would you make statements in advertising subject to civil claims? If I can show you made technically factual but misleading statements to the public about the differences between our products I am entitled to recover lost sales from you?"

As it stands, I see the less advanced technology thriving for longer than it should, for example fossil fuels today are not being replaced at a pace that would align with what the market demands. More and better government programs to increase sustainable energy would lead to breakthroughs, more (better) jobs, and a healthier economy for 99%.

The alteration then propagates during embryonic and later development).<p>There have been a number of very promising studies in the past year or two with regard to gene therapies to apply to adults, such as animal studies that demonstrated a cure for an inherited muscular dystrophy, but in the bigger picture, comprehensive coverage of tissues and cells is still something that the research community is in the midst of getting to grips with."

Unprepared foods are generally exempt from sales tax, while store-prepared foods are not exempt. E.g. an unsliced bagel in NY is untaxed, but a sliced bagel can&#x2F;must be taxed. Fruit and vegetables likely fall into the untaxed category.<p>From Wikipedia: In grocery stores, unprepared food items are not taxed but vitamins and all other items are. Ready-to-eat hot foods, whether sold by supermarkets or other vendors, are taxed. Restaurant bills are taxed. As an exception, hot beverages and bakery items are tax-exempt if and only if they are for take-out and are not sold with any other hot food. If consumed on the seller&#x27;s premises, such items are taxed like restaurant meals.

But don&#x27;t start there unless you really know what you&#x27;re doing, because the low margins in that market amplify your risks."

These are Indian companies which mostly employ only Indian people, all of whom might be <i>cheap</i> from your standards. I was mainly talking about the American companies that are employing both Americans and Indian H-1Bs, and are allegedly paying less to the similarly qualified Indian workers than their American counter parts (because that&#x27;s where an average US citizen seems to have a problem with &#x27;cheap Indians&#x27; snatching their jobs). These Indian companies&#x27; (Infosys, TCS etc.) jobs were anyway not &quot;American jobs&quot; to begin with, so there&#x27;s no chance of Indians snatching them.<p>I personally don&#x27;t have a problem with equally qualified Indians getting paid less than the American counterparts as well, even if that might be the (illegal) case. In a free market, whoever provides best quality with the cheapest price wins anyway (and the employer gets to decide what &#x27;quality&#x27; means to them), so I don&#x27;t understand all the whining. Eventually, it&#x27;s American companies that get benefited by these cheap workers, growing American economy. The local people, then would need to lower their rates to match the competition.

comment,14249273,,,1493750564,,niftich,"They increased the size of some of the touch targets, which is probably the right call on a small mobile touchscreen, but needs to be carefully balanced with content density, as the negative spaces have been increasing over time and there&#x27;s less and less content above the fold.<p>Of course, these screenshots are taken on a desktop with a respectable resolution, where the appeal of these changes for the viewer is less pronounced: there&#x27;s some futzing around with the spacing, the default text size has slightly increased to no real benefit. There&#x27;s more negative space on the desktop too, but the larger screen size offsets some of the losses. Dark mode is nice.<p>Overall, it feels like a bit of a wash, but, if they&#x27;re gaining both a conforming design and a redone UI architecture, I can understand.

Both departments serve customers in a roundabout way. Dev is responsible for turning user stories (generated either by other devs, focus groups, and so forth - which may, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily involve an actual paying customer) into code, ops is responsible for keeping that code running.<p>If dev screws up, user gets bugs, or the app goes down. Same for ops - it&#x27;s just the class of bugs are different.<p><i>Application developers are telling you they want the kind of functionality that Docker offers. That makes it your job to figure out how that happens, not if it happens.</i><p>As long as me and my ops team are the primary people with skin in the game (read: getting 3AM wakeup calls), me and my team will maintain a say in what tech stack we&#x27;re responsible for the care and feeding of. The dark days of dev throwing code over the wall to ops is long gone - I am gobsmacked that you&#x27;d suggest that this is for some reason improper.<p>What dev often forgets, and the cause of much strife, is this justification. If you want a team of n people to learn this new thing and its new ways of operating, then you <i>need</i> to do an honest, dispassionate cost&#x2F;value analysis. And show your work, dammit. When this never happens, it conveys an &quot;Oh great, Dev is on one of their &#x27;Ooh, shiny!&#x27; kicks again&quot; mentality to the rest of the team, especially those that aren&#x27;t politically connected enough in the org to know any different. <i>I</i> know it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re busy and have insane deadlines to meet.

comment,14249180,,,1493749988,,marssaxman,"The last paper I remember trying to crack was Damas &amp; Milner, on type systems, since I was working on a problem which appeared to be analogous to type inference. I asked a friend for help, and he very kindly translated it for me - he&#x27;s actually written a long series of blog posts now, based on those emails:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ericlippert.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;4498&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ericlippert.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;4498&#x2F;</a><p>As with virtually every other CS paper using math notation, I found the Damas &amp; Milner paper utterly incomprehensible at first, but once I&#x27;d seen the formulas translated into a notation I can actually read, I was able to go back and learn something useful from it.<p>Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that there really is no one such thing as &quot;math notation&quot;, not in the sense that there is one programming notation called &quot;Python&quot; and another called &quot;Haskell&quot; and yet another called &quot;C++&quot;, such that one can go read a tutorial for some specific language and thereby come to understand how its notation works. Instead, it appears that &quot;math notation&quot; is a huge collection of little micro-notations, all mixed up together in a more or less ad-hoc fashion by the author of each paper."
comment,14249177,,,1493749970,,SwellJoe,"That kind of law would guarantee only quite large business can survive, which is counter-productive if one wants to empower individuals.<p>I&#x27;m pretty much always on the side of workers in any discussion of labor vs. employers...but, there&#x27;s also small business to consider. I think there&#x27;s some kind of happy medium to be found, where workers are treated well and small businesses can survive long enough to become somewhat bigger businesses. In the US this is codified into law; rules and regulations that apply to large companies may not apply to smaller mom-and-pop shops.<p>My company couldn&#x27;t afford to give an employee more than a few months paid time off; we&#x27;re a four-person company, and we&#x27;d literally run out of money if a quarter of our work wasn&#x27;t being done for months.

I never tried buying produce there (we&#x27;d mostly hoard Asian snacks) but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was more expensive and less fresh than Chinatown simply as a result of the additional shipping&#x2F;refrigeration required.

comment,14249078,,,1493749347,,felipellrocha,"I think the argument of the article is flawed at the core. &quot;Optimizing for fresh eyes is the wrong optimization&quot;. You&#x27;re always having to optimize for fresh eye, whether that be for a new coming developer, or for yourself, when you haven&#x27;t worked at some piece of code for a couple of months, after you have forgotten about the details of the implementation of something you wrote yourself.<p>Implicit code, by definition, increases your cognitive load. Because, now, not only you have to read code, and imagine about how it would run. You have to read it, remember all the context of what the code is supposed to do for you, and only then you&#x27;re able to picture what exactly it is you wanna change.<p>This leads to harder to maintain code. The &quot;amortized over a lifetime&quot; part never really happens. Worse is if you leave the company, leaving all the context behind! &quot;How does this code work? I don&#x27;t know... The person who knew left&quot;<p>One more thing against implicit code. It makes it <i>extremely</i> difficult to make things work once you&#x27;re out of the realm of the assumptions made by whoever wrote that piece of code...<p>And that is what i think is the killer part of writing implicit code... Besides everything else, if the assumptions don&#x27;t fit your use case 100%, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time making things work, because the implicitness hides that part of code (again, by definition)..."
comment,14249075,,,1493749330,,captainmuon,"Maybe controversial, but I first got internet access in 1999 as a 15-year old. And yes, that meant games, malware, and porn.

They can tell great stories, and are not &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; then a book per se. If you enjoy them in moderation, and go outside enough, games are a great thing.

comment,14249072,,,1493749313,,anigbrowl,"No, everyone does not win. I lose, because I&#x27;ve had to process a bunch of junk commercial messages that substantially distracted from the task I was trying to achieve while falsely claiming to be helping me. The value of the content ads are underwriting is frequently lower than the cost of the distractions created by the adverts themselves.<p>I <i>like</i> good advertising. If an ad is well-designed I&#x27;ll look at it for its own sake. If I&#x27;m interested in a product or service I will scrutinize an informative ad in detail and read every commercial appeal therein.I am open to polite commercial pitches.<p>What I&#x27;m not open to is bullshit. If an advertiser leveraes distraction, misrepresentation, or other popular tactics to promote a commercial message, I become hostile to them because I do not care to be communicated with that way.

Because of the capital investment involved there are few &quot;startups&quot; in the ISP space. If there&#x27;s technological innovation happening it&#x27;s not filtering down to the consumer in the form of lower prices.<p>Here in Canada the effective price of LTE access per GB has continuously gone up in the face of &quot;innovation&quot; on how to structure billing for optimal revenue generation.

Generally when digging through public finance statements from congress (that&#x27;s the sort of crazy I am), I often see the 5k limit hit by multiple entities in the same industry around the same timeframe, so that 5k limit ends up being 50-100k, not including all the other ways to <i>pay</i> for a legislator.<p>That&#x27;s not even adressing the issue that ISPs have so much data they could probably run their own blackmail ops and similar dirty tricks if donations weren&#x27;t enough."

Ideally, they&#x27;ll be honest about the use of such animal parks - for the overwhelming majority of cases, though, if they claim the subjects to be wild, they will be.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the photos won&#x27;t have been processed, of course - that&#x27;s entirely up to individual taste, whether that&#x27;s casting it to monochrome, or boosting the contrast to bring out the skin texture of an elephant.<p>In photography circles, parks like those are promoted as a means for enthusiasts to see species they&#x27;d otherwise have to travel great distances for - rather like a cageless zoo. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve engaged in[1], but I can understand the appeal from a hobbyist perspective; and understandably, if you&#x27;re looking for &quot;wildlife&quot; photography on demand, perhaps for an advertising campaign, you&#x27;re unlikely to commission someone to attempt to obtain just the right photo out in the wild.<p>[1] My wildlife focus is primarily rabbits, eg &quot;Momentary&quot;:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;porsupah&#x2F;9495186995&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;porsupah&#x2F;9495186995&#x2F;</a>"

comment,14248937,,,1493748575,,anigbrowl,"You&#x27;re probably right, but:<p>a) Ads on google tend to be much less annoying than from other vendors because google maintains relatively high standards for how it displays ads.

comment,14248919,,,1493748526,,xatan_dank,"So how are you going to be able to determine when advertising is &#x27;fixed&#x27;? It&#x27;s already known that ad services track users and occasionally install malware on their machines. Will the ads simply become more pleasant-looking while becoming more nefarious, or will they actually be more respectful of users&#x27; freedoms? How will you know which is occurring? Also, are you seriously going to stop blocking ads periodically to see if you should keep blocking ads? I think asking or hoping the ad networks to be more polite is more than a little naive.<p>You put a lot of words in my mouth.  I&#x27;m saying Internet advertising is broken to the point where there is no reasonable hope of fixing it.  I&#x27;m saying even if advertising were &quot;fixed&quot;, simply paying for services would be a better move.  I&#x27;m not saying advertisement should not be fixed- I don&#x27;t care.

That&#x27;s probably not fair though.<p>But that&#x27;s actually the industry containers are good for. Enterprise. Predictability trumps costs. The flaws of docker may over time get fixed. It&#x27;s the small companies and startups that are making a fool of themselves by pretending they extract any kind of value out of docker.<p>Imagine a large 100+ man software project that spans two years and involves four different organisations collaborating. There are at least 100+ non-technical &#x27;knowledge workers&#x27; interacting with this process. The people have the intent of &#x27;not being responsible for anything&#x27;, but establishing their position&#x2F;role so their cost&#x2F;budget is validated. You know, the typical large-scale Oracle&#x2F;Cap-Gemini&#x2F;IBM clusterfuck of incompetence.<p>But that&#x27;s the secret! They aren&#x27;t incompetent at all (as organisations). They sell something no-one else sells. They sell predictability.<p>Because for all what it&#x27;s worth: they don&#x27;t make huge architectural fuck ups. They make their deadline. And they are able to deliver something, even with this many stakeholders pissing all over the project from any direction.<p>For them, docker is brilliant. It standardizes something. It doesn&#x27;t do it very well, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. They aren&#x27;t in a low-margin world. &quot;Docker isn&#x27;t really secure, you really should run every docker image in a separate VM&quot;. Sure. These sort of people are paying 500-1000 per instance anyway. No one cares. Coordinating devops with this many stakeholders, now _thats_ expensive.<p>The quality of the actual technology (much like on the web itself) is initially irrelevant. The value is in the fact there&#x27;s a contract. A standard. Docker is a bad implementation of reasonable idea. The question isn&#x27;t if it&#x27;s a good technical choice. No, it&#x27;s not. But it&#x27;s organisational and economically more compatible with the rest of world.<p>And you know what? At least those enterprise idiots will run JVM instances on their docker images, so if they need more than three servers it&#x27;s not because they are incompetent (like every startup wasting their time on cloud orchestration stuff). At least when they pay the price in complexity for building something scalable it&#x27;s because they actually need something scalable."

comment,14248802,,,1493747884,,gdulli,"&gt;  I&#x27;ve never seen a 10x productivity, or even a 2x. I&#x27;d like to see one, show me a scrum where one programmer takes 10 stories on the board, and the others just did one, and he successfully finishes all 10, where the team estimated all stories to be of a full scrum length. I doubt this exist.<p>I always thought of 10x as a qualitative description, not quantitative. There are certain inflection points where the wrong decision can cause a 10x amount of time to be wasted. One person might have the correct (but counter-intuitive) insight about whether building vs. buying is the right move for a given project. (For example.) Everyone else on the team disagrees and goes with the more obvious choice, which becomes a disaster of a project.<p>So I see 10x as more about wisdom and strategy, not doing 10x the work. It&#x27;s not always such an large and obvious inflection point, it can be a single algorithm that can be done simply with little code or in just the opposite way. The right approach can reduce the complexity and code by 10x over time as the bugs go down, the maintenance goes down, etc.<p>These things add up, and over time a project under one person&#x27;s leadership can easily end up with 10x the complexity, bugs, etc. for needless reasons that someone else might have avoided.<p>I have no doubt that the gap in value from the best developer to the average (let alone the worst) can span 10x over time."

When study subjects were given an opportunity to disagree with sexist statements, for example, they were then more likely to favor giving a stereotypically male job to a man instead of a woman (compared to people who weren’t exposed to the statements). Likewise, people who believed they were morally good were more likely to cheat on a math test.<p>That&#x27;s interesting.

If it helps to put things into context, I spent a ton of 1997 using a chisel to shave a bit off standard RAM to help avoid Sun&#x27;s near 10x markup. The startup I worked at was provisioning around 20 Sun boxes per week and we had to patch together tools to manage infrastructure of that size before off-the-shelf tooling to do that really existed. I wrote a lot of expect in 97-98.<p>Where I get frustrated with ops is when they forget that they&#x27;re in the service business. They&#x27;re there to serve application developers in the same way that the application developers are there to serve customers. An application developer pushing back at a customer ask with the line, &quot;without really stopping to ask what progress <i>is</i> from the perspective of developers&quot; would be rightly lampooned. And yet somehow there&#x27;s people that think the ops mindset is reasonable. In my view, &quot;no&quot; is not a valid viewpoint. Application developers are telling you they want the kind of functionality that Docker offers. That makes it your job to figure out <i>how</i> that happens, not <i>if</i> it happens."

When I went to college, I had extensive experience with BASIC (GW, Q, TI, and a bit of Visual), a year of C++ in high school, and a few vague attempts at assembly (386 and Z80) that got me nowhere. The idea of function pointers was one of those scary advanced C things that I had picked up to avoid, and certainly the corresponding assembly concept didn&#x27;t occur to me. Of course I knew you could jump to a computed value, but the <i>mindset</i> was foreign. I sort of knew that this was doable with objects in C++ - I could define a base class with an abstract method calculate(), and make a Cube subclass - but thinking of functions as first-class still wasn&#x27;t obvious."

If you don&#x27;t use an ORM you are pissing money down the drain, most businesses are reluctant to do that. Using an ORM doesn&#x27;t mean not using SQL when appropriate, it means using the ORM in the 90% of cases where it works best. Complex SQL belongs in views, which are then trivially mapped with the ORM giving you the best of both worlds.  If you&#x27;re doing complex queries with the ORM, the ORM isn&#x27;t the problem, you are.<p>3) Should be.<p>4) Nor should they, programmers are expensive, paying them to do what a library can do better is a waste of money and time.

And while that&#x27;s probably something that depends on one&#x27;s knowledge and past experience, I think there&#x27;s something to it. The parens mean that it&#x27;s unambiguous, and there is very little work on the reader&#x27;s part to figure out where an expression begins and ends.<p>There&#x27;s no operator precedence to keep in mind, no special whitespace rules, etc. It&#x27;s about as minimal as you can get while still being completely explicit about syntactic constructs."

comment,14248547,,,1493746510,,ianbicking,"10x productivity is fairly common when onboarding people to a project, though it&#x27;s not quite so obvious because you&#x27;ll give the new person small bugs or stories.  And if someone is simply not productive, there might continue to be a 10x between team members, and the team keeps giving the unproductive person small or non-essential tasks, and not accounting for the support that member receives to finish that work.<p>I&#x27;ve been on both sides of the 10x divide (i.e., the 1x working with a 10x, the 10x working with a 1x).  To be clear, these productivity levels were relative to the project, understanding of the project, and the point in the project&#x27;s lifecycle.  There&#x27;s native talent, but context is just as important.<p>It&#x27;s not really sustainable to have that productivity difference unless you have a team structure to support it and bring people up – and sometimes I wonder if the team structure is more emotional cover than an actual aggregate productivity boost.  It&#x27;s not sustainable because the 1x developer can&#x27;t handle the 10x developer&#x27;s velocity of change.  If you are the 1x developer, just at the point when you think you&#x27;ve finally made a valuable improvement, the rug gets pulled out from underneath you yet again because of a change or fix made by someone else.  It&#x27;s demoralizing for everyone, and the 1x developer often becomes the 0x developer (I&#x27;m afraid this has also happened to me).<p>It&#x27;s harder to find unsustainable states because they don&#x27;t last for long (team breaks up, everyone becomes demoralized, people drift off, etc), which is part of why I think 10x productivity is sometimes treated as a myth."

We had most top CS grads in North America groomed on SICP at one point in history. You&#x27;d think many of them would want to use Lisp in production. Many of them did. Now MIT uses Python to introduce programming, and Lisp code bases tend to be (horrifying) legacy systems.

comment,14248295,,,1493745211,,cr0sh,"I could be wrong, but I think the main reason business logic is put into the DB (and provided that the &quot;users&quot; of the DB are also segregated properly), is to present a cohesive view to all users of the DB.<p>Too often, when you have a &quot;wide open&quot; DB and multiple &quot;users&quot; of that DB (think groups within an org) decide to query it (whether just for reading, or worse, updating), the queries can often turn out to be radically different for the same business logic.<p>Maybe one development group thinks that a query should be done one way, while another thinks that to get the same data it should be done another, and now you have two or more groups disseminating data to other groups in totally different ways.<p>You may ask why the organization has multiple development groups, but it occurs. I worked for one company I won&#x27;t name because it isn&#x27;t important - as a web developer in their marketing department; our group was considered as separate from the IT group, which handled the main &quot;DB&quot; which was based around AS&#x2F;400 systems and Apache SOLR - we worked together as best as possible, but also bumped heads, in that they wanted us to only work with their &quot;DB&quot; (I don&#x27;t really consider SOLR to be a DB, though it can and is used like one by a variety of orgs) through their interface (which at times didn&#x27;t work like they documented it - and many times changed without us knowing about it until our stuff broke mysteriously - usually around the end-of-year holiday push) - whereas we needed to store a lot of the stuff &quot;nearline&quot; in a MySQL DB (we used MySQL, PHP, and AWS for much of our development) to make things more responsive for our end users (ie - the people buying the products the company made off the websites we were creating). In essence, we a bit of a &quot;split personality&quot; going on - but our main boss was only two levels removed from the CEO of the company, so our stuff generally was tolerated - but it is a similar situation.<p>Where you have multiple dev groups (whether by design or because &quot;ad-hoc&quot; things occur - like Bob in accounting figuring out how to use ODBC with Excel macros to query the database for data for his and other departments), you can have this kind of chaos. When the DB is heavily controlled by IT, with the only &quot;views&quot; of it through tightly controlled business logic which is part of the DB, this kind of difference in data can be controlled.<p>But it does have many more downsides, which also means it probably shouldn&#x27;t be used or done in that manner. Instead, the interface should probably be through a single interface (RESTful or similar), with the business logic in the code of that interface, and only the barest needed other logic in the DB to tie it together. Provided that the security on the DB is tightly controlled, and the only way other groups can access the data is via the exposed interface API, you can achieve the same results I think.<p>In a way, that&#x27;s how we had the access at that one company - we had a RESTful interface API to the backend SOLR store; we could send a formatted &quot;query object&quot; and get back one or more &quot;records&quot; as a stream of data (we&#x27;d then usually take the data, parse through it and store parts of it into our MySQL DB - because the query&#x2F;response time of that SOLR DB was horrible from a web development perspective; I don&#x27;t think this was the fault of IT, but rather the fact that the datastore on the backend was vast, holding information about products dating back 60 or more years - I&#x27;m sure there was likely some COBOL in the mix somewhere).<p>That did have the downside of the fact that if we wanted a particular means to query for something that didn&#x27;t exist in the existing API, we either had to make due with what we could do &quot;locally&quot; (thru code and&#x2F;or mysql &quot;buffering&quot;), or we had to put in a request for a change to the IT group (which may or may not get accepted, and might take weeks for the turnaround time before we could use it). Furthermore, as I mentioned before, there were more than a few times that we rolled out a particular feature, only to have the website(s) that relied on that feature break because the backend API changed &quot;behind our backs&quot; (and we usually saw this over a holiday period, when our sales would peak of course). In many cases, we couldn&#x27;t do anything about this (not even storing the SOLR information - it was too vast, plus there was a nagging idea that if we tried that someone&#x27;s head would roll for not using the implemented interfaces and data that already existed - we could &quot;buffer&quot; or &quot;cache&quot; things, but we couldn&#x27;t wholesale transfer the data over)."

comment,14248247,,,1493744930,,fictioncircle,"&gt; Their tech screen was so ludicrously easy it made me wonder what the current standard is for developers.<p>Just fyi, its probably because many developers don&#x27;t touch binary.<p>I work with numbers all day but they are currency transactions and accounting data. I haven&#x27;t cared about transforming something to&#x2F;from binary in 10+ years and couldn&#x27;t do it without googling.<p>However, the number of devs (and accountants) who can&#x27;t figure out a 4-4-5 calendar reliably is quite impressive."

comment,14248232,,,1493744849,,BoiledCabbage,"It&#x27;s been stated a number of times, but<p>x.f(y, z) has just as many parens as (f x y z). And Haskell particularly comes with so many syntax quirks. There is a lot of cruft you need to learn to get to the underlying functional core of haskell. Lips you can get 100% of the cruft out within a few days &#x2F; 1 week. And the rest is just understanding programming concepts.<p>I don&#x27;t use any LISP on a regular basis, but it still amazes me how often people are willing to dismiss a language based on parens.<p>It reminds me of a friend who would never try food from any other country because: <i>Look at all the weird colors and ingredients. I&#x27;m not trying that.</i><p>In the end, no one will ever force anyone to try something - but my view in life is if everyone raves about something, and my main concern with it is by (my own admission) superficial. I still go and give it a try.<p>SICP gives you a new view on programming regardless of whether you ever touch lisp again or not."

comment,14248226,,,1493744792,,geebee,"I hear this comment every now and then.  Because so many people say this, I really do mean this as a sincere question and opening to a discussion: have you considered the concept of supply and demand curves?<p>At a low price, the market will demand a lot of a good or service, but there&#x27;s less incentive to supply.  At a high price, the market will demand less of a good or service, but there will be more incentive to supply.<p>Let&#x27;s apply this to developers.  At minimum wage, there would be a lot of demand for developers.  However, there wouldn&#x27;t be much incentive to become a developer.  As a result, there would be far more job openings than people interested in working the job.<p>At 500k a year, fewer people would want the services of developers, because they&#x27;d only be needed for very high value projects.  However, lots of people would be lining up to take the job.<p>Economic theory tells us that supply and demand will meet at an equilibrium.  So if there are far more job openings than developers, that suggests that the curves are not yet in equilibrium.  As salaries for developers rise, demand will fall, until they are in balance.<p>Markets aren&#x27;t perfect, and the real world is messy.  But supply and demand are still in effect, and your comment suggests that you haven&#x27;t even considered this.  Saying that is a shortage of developers at 100k a year makes as much sense as saying there&#x27;s high unemployment among developers who will only work for 500k a year.<p>Except that even that rarely happens.  People who talk of a shortage of developers, amazingly enough, most often don&#x27;t even <i>mention</i> salary.  It&#x27;s as if they have no concept of how salary affects both supply and demand.<p>Now, in this particular iteration, we do have a number, $500,000 a year.  However, many of us on this forum are calling malarkey.  Show us some numbers that you&#x27;re actually offering and paying this salary and we&#x27;ll talk.  Otherwise, many of us suspect this is all bluster."

comment,14248217,,,1493744757,,simplify,"I find lisp to be the most beautiful and readable language. Lisp has practically zero syntax; all code can be written equally.

comment,14248196,,,1493744659,,tromp,"Lisp has the minimal syntax for lists:<p><pre><code>    (a b c d)

where other languages require separating commas,
but Haskell has minimal syntax for function application:<p><pre><code>     f x y z

with no parenthesis needed. (Technically, this is a triple application ((f x) y) z, masked by the convention of application being a left-associative binary operator.)"
