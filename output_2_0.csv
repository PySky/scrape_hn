comment,14278256,,,1494035842,,Myrmornis,"Psychiatry is such an embarrassment, in the US and UK at least. So many otherwise reasonably intelligent people believe in the concrete reality of &quot;diagnoses&quot; that are merely descriptive at best, and delusional at worst. The number of parents who are led to believe that their child &quot;has&quot; &quot;dyslexia&quot; or &quot;ADHD&quot; is astonishing; and the ramifications in terms of extra time in exams, free laptops etc are absurd. One form of evidence for these assertions is the lack of cultural replication: I don&#x27;t have citations, but I understand that many of these concepts do not have parallels in other languages&#x2F;cultures where one would would expect replication if these really were biological phenomena. I guess people will always see shapes in clouds, but when it comes to serious matters like education, the rational, scientific side of our society needs to be kind but firm in stamping this stuff out. But when will it finally happen -- perhaps not until we&#x27;ve also got over the idiocy of religion, and the idiocy of the &quot;postmodernism&quot;-influenced humanities?"
comment,14278253,,,1494035819,,rabbyte,"speaking for myself it&#x27;s not ever the offense I take issue with it&#x27;s the ubiquity of popular offense. that every space must be a space wherein offensive speech is permitted including spaces created to cater to other genuine concerns such as recovery from debilitating trauma. churches have been a safe space for certain kinds of thought for centuries, some churches even creating a safe space within their safe space where a person can confess to any sin without suffering the adverse social affects.<p>it&#x27;s on this point that I think people lose their minds. the vulnerable see a world completely set against them and have no ability to create an island for themselves so they over react and become militant with time as popular social movements continually fail to understand them. I see wrong on both ends for different reasons but in a hyper connected world where everything is happening all the time, the marginalized by definition must lose out. the freedom to offend is not the only attribute worth protecting, despite how very serious our history teaches us otherwise. the world isn&#x27;t just becoming smaller, it&#x27;s becoming flat, and that is another dimension worth pushing against.<p>there are no easy positions to take here. there are no obvious answers. defending free speech is obvious and good and I&#x27;m in favor of erring on the side of caution but the longer people take a principled stand on offense and dismiss the motivations of the people pushing against it, the further this situation will deteriorate."

comment,14278229,,,1494035374,,yeukhon,I understand. I have another motivation which is getting JSON and wanting a OOP object to mainpluate with. Take AWS&#x27; boto3 response. Well documented but the nested response structure gives me a chill and I wish there&#x27;s a direct object out of the JSON. I instead had to write my own class for the conversion. If I could mainpluate dict like mainpluatig attribute in a class then I could just write my function&#x27;s contract &quot;input is a response object from X APi&quot; instead of &quot;dict of this form.&quot;<p>Quite annoying and I know some people considered what I wish is a bad practice.

comment,14278214,,,1494035108,,rjeli,"I learned programming through Scratch as a young kid. I was frustrated with the limitations of the syntax, and the lack of structured programming (although I didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for). However, I loved it and came back to it every single night for the community - uploading new games I made, getting comments and loves from my friends, and not only checking out their games but downloading them and reading the source.<p>edit, as I keep thinking about this: Remixes were also huge - not only could you download someone&#x27;s project, you could tweak it and reupload it as a remix. There were also galleries with curators, which motivated me to make better projects.
I think the language&#x27;s limitations might have encouraged me to think outside the box, actually... simple things were easy, but any complex logic was very difficult. No functions, only event-driven broadcasts and receivers, and the events had to be pre-declared (no dynamic stuff). I remember doing a lot of hacky stuff with lists, like having look-up tables in lists, or having to implement really simple algorithms on my own in this constrained language..."

comment,14278199,,,1494034903,,yeukhon,"Your view on self-driving car is different than mine. I am not sure who came up with the five levels of self-driving car automation, but let me reiterate the last time before I give up trying to convince anyone on this thread.<p>First, for a computer to be able to navigate safely on the road the computer needs to be able to recongize and understand its surroundings. Checked.<p>Next, for computers to be able to be good at driving, we need to train the computer both in the real world and in simulations.<p>Moreover, to ensure we can optimize route, plan ahead we need data about road condition far ahead of us (and sometimes behind us). To be able to make turns on an intersection safely and swiftly, unlike humans who are terrible at making turns and confusing when to turn, computers can coordinate with one another. This requires good network communication. Bluetooth is weak and unstable. In my earlier example, if an ambulance says it is driving heading my direction, my car can coordinate how to empty up a lane for the ambluance to pass. This level of automation is what one sees in a sci-fi movie, which is really what you want besides being able to avoid obstacles like Bat mobile.<p>My point is, we should explore how to make traffic data accessible. There is so much one can do with such data. It takes a good amount of time to get the government onboard and help them build such infrastructure. To finish off my point, meter data is not available, right now apps use crowd source to determine whether a parking spot is available or not. Instead of driving around which causes
more congestion and sometimes accident, governement should make meter data available, and we can still crowd source by using driver&#x27;s camera to recongize whether a spot is opened and send back to datastore.<p>This is essentially the goal of Internet of Things, at rhe city scale. As I mentioned, IBM&#x27;s SmartCities supposed to do stuff above but I really am not sure if IBM will ever pull off given many of their projects ended up on someoen&#x27;s desk covering in dust."

comment,14278187,,,1494034685,,Bjartr,"The difference in the brain for Adderall v. Vyvanse comes down to the concentration of which enantiomoers are (how much of which mirror image of amphetamine there is). It&#x27;s all amphetamine, it all affects the same receptors. The real difference comes down to how long it stays available. Vyvanse sticks around in the blood longer than &quot;plain&quot; amphetamine, but amphetamine crosses into the brain much faster. Both of those are because the liver has to first cleave off the extra molecule tacked onto the amphetamine that makes it Vyvanse. That can only happen so fast, and until it does it&#x27;s too big to cross the blood&#x2F;brain barrier or get otherwise disposed of."

comment,14278160,,,1494034308,,drawnwren,"Another anecdote from someone on HN, which probably biases pretty hard for people who have had success medicating ADHD. I dropped out of a bottom tier state school at 19 studying CS with essentially a 0.0. In my mid 20s I was diagnosed with ADHD by a GP and a psychiatrist and got a second opinion from a second psychiatrist who said the first two were wrong. I stopped medication because of sentiment like that expressed in the article. A year or two later I decided I didn&#x27;t like what I was doing, and wanted to return to school. I saw a second GP and got rediagnosed and prescribed. I&#x27;m now studying CS at a top 5 university with a 4.0.<p>My personal opinion is that there is more harm from the negative stigma associated w&#x2F; ADHD prescription than good, but you can imagine I would be biased given my narrative."

Some of the best people on our team don’t have college degrees. However they are intensely curious and always trying to understand how and why things work, and how to improve them.

comment,14278052,,,1494032876,,mtdewcmu,"I think of ADD as Amphetamine Deficit Disorder. In a practical sense, &quot;ADD&quot; is the disorder that afflicts people who function better when given amphetamines. Personally, I feel that anyone who wants to take amphetamines should be allowed to.<p>I think that inability to concentrate is a common pathway for essentially all diseases that afflict man. Anything a disease does to draw your attention to itself is affecting concentration, because you are not able to concentrate on whatever you want to concentrate on. In some cases, this is insidious and you are not aware of the disease as such; it affects your concentration and you don&#x27;t understand why. In some cases, you might only know that you can&#x27;t concentrate. Amphetamines will tend to help, because they allow you to concentrate harder on what you want to concentrate on, regardless of the actual etiology of whatever is distracting you."

With that disclaimer out of the way lets begin:<p>From what I gather it (Adult ADHD) is also very hard to distinguish from bipolar disorder. It took 18 months of moving around with anti-psychotics and other drugs to treat my &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; before my doctor realized that it was ADHD and we found almost immediate results from the treatment.<p>It sucks that the diagnosis seems to be so easy to get for some people and they&#x27;re doing it for the adderall. In my case it helped me significantly, moving up in my career and ultimately bringing me out of an almost decade long depression with myself. I hope that people who actually need help get it, and to put it simply, screw the others who make it hard for people to be properly diagnosed. My diagnosis took so long because of the known abuse to get the drugs, from what I gathered in conversations with my doctor, and she was reluctant to consider that diagnosis until she was absolutely sure of it."

comment,14277956,,,1494031225,,aisofteng,"To go on a slight tangent but one I think very relevant here, considering other comments here about the overt politics of late night talk shows, such as another commenter&#x27;s remark about not recalling previous late night hosts resorting to so many partisan jokes, it seems most people are neither aware of the former FCC&#x27;s Fairness Doctrine nor its repeal:<p>&gt;The Fairness Doctrine was a policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was — in the Commission&#x27;s view — honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC, which was believed to have been under pressure from then President Ronald Reagan, eliminated the Doctrine in 1987. The FCC formally removed the language that implemented the Doctrine, in August of 2011.<p>Quote taken from: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fairness_Doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fairness_Doctrine</a><p>There used to be a requirement for broadcasting companies to make a good faith effort to present all sides of a topic and to actually accomplish that goal to a reasonable degree. I am not sure of the historical origins of that policy, but I imagine it was put in place in recognition of the ability of media to sway public opinion and therefore to what degree it could be abused by powerful players with an agenda.<p>I am generally against any governmental regulation of how people communicate, but in this case the regulation was not about content, per se, but about the fairness and integrity of our national information delivery channels. I don&#x27;t know why this was repealed - I keep meaning to research it - but in any case, the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine is a chief causal factor for the state of American media today.<p>As much as I appreciate Colbert now, as much as I watched and enjoyed the commentary by Stewart, Colbert, and others as political pundits, it is also very clear to me that part of their success in what they do is due to affirmation of political views they share with their viewers - and that that can be (and, in my opinion, has been) overall very detrimental because it has led people to silo their beliefs and become more close minded to hearing opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, the role of such pundits has become that of trading in-depth analysis for entertainment and laughs.<p>I generally agree with what seem to be Colbert&#x27;s views and often think he is very sharp and insightful. However, in the context of what I said above and considering how much influence he has, I think that the complaints and investigation discussed in TFA are well-founded."

comment,14277794,,,1494029279,,mindcrime,"<i>Out of curiosity, how much information do you retain from all the books that you&#x27;ve read?</i><p>That&#x27;s a really good question, and one I ask myself a lot.  I honestly don&#x27;t know, and I&#x27;ve read reference to some studies somewhere or other that suggest that most people retain fairly little of what they read.  So my strategy with a lot of books is to read the book, not take notes or anything really, and at the end, make a simple &quot;this is worth revisiting&quot; or &quot;this isn&#x27;t worth revisiting&quot; decision. If it is, I&#x27;ll read it again and either do some light pencil underlining or use post-it page flags to highlight important stuff, OR I&#x27;ll do a full-fledged &quot;create a wiki page for this book on my wiki and take detailed notes&quot; pass.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;ll do the &quot;light pencil underlining and post-it notes&quot; thing on the first pass.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting trade-off...

comment,14277728,,,1494028533,,Arizhel,"&gt;I think it is in society&#x27;s interest to arrange for there to be a number of job-vacancies of the Panera-kid-type available<p>I completely disagree.  It&#x27;s actively making things worse to not use more efficient methods.  Now if a restaurant wants to keep one of those people around for people who don&#x27;t like the kiosks, or maybe to talk to if they have a question about something or want to ask for something the kiosk can&#x27;t do, then that&#x27;s great, because that&#x27;s where people are actually useful: for handling things that automation can&#x27;t, like special cases.  Of course, you don&#x27;t need as many humans this way, since there aren&#x27;t that many people who the kiosk can&#x27;t serve.<p>But having people employed just for the sake of employment is nothing more than make-work.  It&#x27;s just like the Soviet factories where they built wooden crates on one side of the factory, then moved them to the other side of the factory where another team disassembled them for recycling, then moved the wood to the other side of the factory where it was used for building crates, ....  There&#x27;s no dignity in make-work.  If you&#x27;re worried about there not being enough jobs, the answer is the UBI: give people a regular stipend and let them spend it however they want.  At least some of them will find some new enterprise on their own, whether it&#x27;s writing a book (like JK Rowling, who was on welfare when she wrote the books that made her a millionaire--she&#x27;s worth almost $800M), or writing a phone game, or just doing odd jobs and not having to worry so much about having enough for rent because of the irregularity.  The other answer is to get the government to invest in its people by providing education, and by financing important projects (like replacing those bridges).  There&#x27;s plenty of work to be done without resorting to make-work."

comment,14277662,,,1494027795,,dfabulich,"They&#x27;ve been working on a module system for Java for years (codename Jigsaw), one goal of which is to modularize Java itself, and the other goal is to have a module system that developers would use. It hasn&#x27;t gone very well.<p>Today, to run a hello world app, you have to have the entire Java SE platform on disk, including GUI code, XML parsing, CORBA, a MIDI player, etc. A lot of that code is itself written in Java; you&#x27;ll find there&#x27;s a 64MB &quot;rt.jar&quot; file that provides a <i>lot</i> of stuff. One goal of Jigsaw is to allow you to write smaller Java applications on memory-constrained devices.<p>Jigsaw does an OK job at modularizing Java, but has mostly failed at its other goal: to provide a standard module system that Java developers would use. I&#x27;m sure somebody&#x27;s excited to use Jigsaw in their application code, but not many.<p>For example, Jigsaw&#x27;s module system has no notion of libraries with versions. Imagine using Maven or Gradle without any version numbers. That&#x27;s Jigsaw.<p>Jigsaw also set a bunch of other rules that get broken a lot in practice: no circular dependencies, immutable dependencies declared up front, resolve all modules eagerly, etc. These are good guidelines, but it may not be appropriate to make them iron clad rules.<p>In contrast, there&#x27;s a hugely complicated monster module system implemented in Java userland, OSGi. OSGi has a ton of features, including letting you load multiple versions of the &quot;same&quot; jar at once, so one part of your app can use the old version while another part uses a newer version. (And then there&#x27;s Maven, Gradle, etc.)<p>This certainly wouldn&#x27;t be the first time Java tried to deliver a &quot;standard&quot; solution for a problem that we used to solve in userland that went ignored by Java&#x27;s dev community. (Logging?!) If we all ignored Jigsaw and kept using Maven&#x2F;Gradle&#x2F;OSGi, but the Java platform became more modular, that&#x27;s probably a win.<p>But Jigsaw includes another poisonous feature; it &quot;improves security&quot; by forbidding access to internal JDK APIs like sun.misc.Unsafe, which provides access to direct memory management. For better or worse, that internal API has been used and abused by a lot of popular Java infrastructure libraries, so they&#x27;re now introducing a new Unsafe feature in Java 9, but it&#x27;s not the same one, &quot;breaking&quot; compatibility. It&#x27;s their reserved right to break that API, but but but.<p>And finally there&#x27;s the fact that Java 9 has taken a hugely long time, and this is significantly due to Jigsaw. If Jigsaw misses Java 9, does it land in Java 10? Throw it out completely? (Does Java <i>ever</i> get modularized?)"

I feel like the state of documentation of Haskell libraries in general could be much better.<p>There was actually a thread on &#x2F;r&#x2F;haskell a few months ago [0] in response to an HN comment.

The tutorial walks you through different pieces of the library, how to use them, and how they come together.<p>It&#x27;s hands down one of the most effective ways of documenting I&#x27;ve ever seen and I&#x27;d love to see other communities&#x27; take on it.<p>To point out a specific example, you should check out Turtle&#x27;s tutorial [1].<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;haskell&#x2F;comments&#x2F;5khts3&#x2F;on_haskell_documentation&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;haskell&#x2F;comments&#x2F;5khts3&#x2F;on_haskell_...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;turtle-1.3.3&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Turtle-Tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;turtle-1.3.3&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Turtle...</a>"

comment,14277623,,,1494027361,,Clubber,"Yes, I would also like to know how doubling the work force as a factor in pushing down wages is a fallacy (particularly in the 80s). I understand it&#x27;s a complex problem. Another factor in stagnant wages is automation and much of what we tout as worker productivity isn&#x27;t necessarily workers working 10x faster or harder, but automation allowing them to get 10x more done. Think in terms of Excel vs &quot;running the numbers&quot; manually, databases vs. file cabinets, etc. As an aside, part of the reason the VA is so inefficient is that many of their patient records are (were?) in file cabinets.<p>The worker doesn&#x27;t do 10x the work out of pure skill (though learning to use Excel is part of it) but the investment in licenses and software done by the business. It&#x27;s fair to say if the business invested in building a software system, they should reap the benefits of the productivity it yields, even though that stagnates wages. I also believe a worker who understands Excel should have higher wages than one that doesn&#x27;t, though today, it&#x27;s a requirement for a job in accounting."

comment,14277611,,,1494027148,,icantdrive55,"I repair watches.<p>I started out just loving Rolex Bubblebacks--years ago.  I loved all watches.  I started learning about the repair of watches.  It took me a awhile to accumulate the right tools, at the right price.  In order to be be efficent, it did take me a few years, but it was a hobby for myself.<p>The love of mechanical watches will just come around for a lot of people.  I haven&#x27;t figured if it&#x27;s because certain people like precisely engineered items, like Apple products, or it&#x27;s kinda the only acceptable form of adornment for men in all cultures, or men are subconsciously aware they die earlier than females.(Yes--some women just love all aspects of horology, but in my experience, it a different passion than men.  Plus--I can&#x27;t sell women&#x27;s high end watches.  It&#x27;s so difficult, I don&#x27;t even buy them for resale anymore.  It&#x27;s changing a bit though, especially with the Fitbit, and even female Rolexes are not sitting on a website for years anymore.<p>That said, once you imerce yourself in watch repair, there&#x27;s a moment where you look at an older Rolex movement, and a say a modified(usually just engine work on the movement) on a better ETA movement, and don&#x27;t see why a Rolex costs so much more.  Yes, their are differences quality differences, but not to the tune of thousand of dollars more.  Basically, a Rolex, Patek, IWC, etc., were machined to be easily taken apart.  A lot of thought was put into ease of repair. It&#x27;s ironic you can&#x27;t buy parts for said watches from the factory?<p>And here I go, that Rolex some of you are wearing on your wrist, when it goes out of warranty, you won&#x27;t be able to have just anyone repair it.  Rolex,  the Swatch Group, along with most of the other watch brands will have you send your timepiece back to the factory when it needs a service, or repair.  At factory prices. I refuse to spend $800 on a clean, and lube.<p>See, when you buy that $10,000 watch, even if you spent years learning how to repair, they won&#x27;t sell you parts, or even offer service diagrams.  It&#x27;s like buying a car, and having to take it to the dealership fir repairs forever, and not being able to buy parts for it.<p>Seiko is one watch company that still sells parts to consumers.<p>O.k.--what&#x27;s my point?  Certain high end watch companies, appear to be guilty of The Sherman Anti-trust Act.  Yes--the federal government looked into it, but figured it wasen&#x27;t a top priority, and called it a rich man&#x27;s problem.<p>To those interested, a grey market watch, like those at Costco, were bought overseas at overseas prices.  Rolex warranty will not honor those watches if they stop, even if under warranty.).<p>I just read the post about GI&#x27;s not being able to code.  If you happen to like watches, there&#x27;s a few watch repair schools left on the world.  Rolex is sponsoring many of them.  They need technicians at their factories.  Many schools offer free tuition, but not boarding.  It&#x27;s not a bad deal.<p>And again--if you&#x27;re about to spend thousands on a fine watch, call the watch company and ask about parts, and &quot;just what will happen when it goes out of warranty, and needs a service?&quot;."

Are you claiming that people choose those jobs over other, better jobs?<p>If I didn&#x27;t own a car and was considering making a career as an Uber driver I&#x27;d happily accept a lower level of pay and rent someone else&#x27;s car for a few months to get a sense of how much the job appealed to me and how hard I&#x27;d need to work to make money.<p>The person renting out the car is the one who has taken out loans and risk and now owns a depreciating asset.

comment,14277446,,,1494025238,,hwillis,"copying my other comment:<p>&gt;Lithium is one of the most prevalent elements on earth. Spodumene (rocky lithium ore) is likely to be a very important economic source in the future as it is much more common than the brine currently used to manufacture batteries. Brine requires a water pump to extract, spodumene requires mining like any normal mineral, but it&#x27;s found in extremely high quality deposits in the US including single crystals up to 47 feet across. That means higher quality lithium in addition to greater availability.<p>&gt;Spodumene is ~6-7% lithium by mass and is mined in an open pit, so no worries about soil or water pollution. It&#x27;s separated from other rocks by grinding, flotation, and then acid. Very few people like acid in their industrial processes but I will note that lithium production uses way less hydroflouric acid than oil refining. The final stage uses sulfuric acid and while again acid is never good, sulfuric acid is one of the most-used and most-produced chemicals. Most minerals require sulfuric acid for extraction. It comes in a bottle of drain cleaner. Mining lithium rock is as economically painless as buying blasting powder and excavators, and as environmentally painless as... well nothing. The pollution is basically negligible.<p>I didn&#x27;t know the gigafactory was gonna do component-level recycling, that&#x27;s pretty cool.  I think it should be relatively easy to separate the metals from the SEI and graphite&#x2F;lithium in a recoverable way, but processing the SEI has to be pretty complex.  Maybe acid would do it- at that point it would probably be worth it to recycle the lithium but you&#x27;d have to set up an entire process line just to be able to add it to raw feedstock ore.  It&#x27;ll take a LOT of battery recycling before that&#x27;s more profitable than selling it as clinker."

Historically with a constrained pool of labour, you&#x27;d expect wages to rise to get the few available candidates to work for you. Since the 1970&#x27;s, that pool is essentially 33-60% great than what it could have been. Also during the 1970&#x27;s you saw an increased rate of women attending university.

comment,14277284,,,1494023536,,kyleschiller,"There&#x27;s a huge difference between the theoretical ability to learn something and actually having access to education. I completely agree that we&#x27;re living at a time when anyone with a decent laptop and internet connection has access to the basic required materials, but learning something from scratch with minimal guidance is difficult, and the huge amount of mythologizing around programming has made it even worse.<p>Bootcamps, at least Dev Bootcamp, focus heavily on the mental&#x2F;emotional aspect of this stuff as much as the technical material itself, and do a lot to build the confidence that really is required for many people.<p>And yeah, I do think most companies are primarily incentivized by profits, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t provide a genuine service at the same time.<p>Full disclaimer, I used to work for Udacity and was &quot;trying to make a buck&quot;."
comment,14277281,,,1494023473,,rhapsodic,"<i>&gt;She probably became combative because you were deploying the lump of labour fallacy and in doing so either explicitly or implicitly blaming women working for the failures of economic policy since the 70s.</i><p>That&#x27;s not a valid reason to become combative. If she felt the GP was wrong, she could have simply, with facts and logic, explained why she felt that way.<p>In my observation, when people respond to an argument with combativeness, it usually means they realize they <i>cannot</i> refute the argument with facts and logic. So they get all nasty and start name-calling (e.g. &quot;you&#x27;re a racist!&quot;) or they deploy some childish, imbecilic bromide like accusing the other person of &quot;mansplaining&quot;."
comment,14277278,,,1494023437,,dragonwriter,"&gt; Also, the FSF isn&#x27;t arguing for abolishing copyright, merely reducing its term.<p>Sure, but that&#x27;s immaterial. FSF (and many others; again, this is the fairly explici Constitutional rationale) views copyright bit as a natural right, but as a legal right which is desirable, within certain bounds, because managed properly it can produce certain public benefits.<p>This is at odds with your apparent view that copyright is a <i>natural right</i>.<p>&gt; The source code isn&#x27;t being published to begin with, so all of the usual arguments regarding length of copyright protection are kind of meaningless.<p>The lack of publication actually doesn&#x27;t render the arguments for time limitations moot, only the argument that copyright in such works provides a public benefit (though that can be remedied by altering the terms of mandatory deposit to apply, instead of within a set time after publication, to apply within a set time after creation, and to adopt as a consequence of deposit failure forfeiture of copyright.)"

comment,14277269,,,1494023267,,primitivesuave,"I have run an organization that teaches kids to code and advocates for coding literacy for the last 5 years, and I agree with you that kids as young as 8 years old can absorb a text-based language when presented in the right way. However, typing speeds are generally quite slow amongst elementary school kids, so the rate at which they can make interesting things happen is much slower. That initial dopamine rush when connecting Scratch blocks is a very effective way to get them to see programming as an exciting and fulfilling endeavor. By eliminating the possibility of syntax errors through block-based languages, you can put their entire initial focus on semantics, without having to divert their attention toward syntactical correctness.<p>Also, it takes a certain kind of computer scientist to teach computer science effectively, and most elementary school teachers do not match that requirement no matter how much PD you give them. I would say most elementary school teachers can&#x27;t handle much beyond the basics of Scratch, but that is more than enough to get the platform in the hands of kids. If the teachers chooses to just let the kids mess around with Scratch rather than give them structure and clearly defined goals, they will still do just fine. If a teacher takes a similar lax approach with typed programming, the kids will most likely learn nothing at all, and will often develop an aversion to programming altogether.<p>But I completely agree with you on the importance of teaching typed programming. My heart aches when I hear of middle school CS classes using Scratch. That&#x27;s the perfect age to start exposing kids to Arduinos, Python, Raspberry Pi, etc. The BBC Microbit foundation has been doing a great job in the UK bridging the gap between Scratch and typed programming with their Microbit platform (microbit.org), and (shameless self-plug) I work on this problem as well with techlabeducation.com and pythonroom.com.<p>I think what kids miss most of all from typed programming is the idea that a language is just like a human language, where each language has its own metaphors and way of thinking (an idea put forth by Seymour Papert in his 1998 paper &quot;Mindstorms&quot;)."

From my experience you need to show them that it&#x27;s the company culture to challenge things in a smart and constructive way. To do that, you do nothing very formal, just sit your best guys with the newcomer, explaining how things works and why. And sometimes, criticizing the current stuff, but not in a authoritarian way - something like we know we can do better, just nothing really worked well or we didn&#x27;t have time but now we do.<p>That way it feels much more like -&gt; we have something we could do better, and the guys are trying to improve that, let&#x27;s do that with them.

But in Ethereum, you could unload a huge number of ETH and the price wouldn&#x27;t budge. I&#x27;m assuming of course you&#x27;re not an institutional trader, in which case of course Ethereum trading volumes are insufficient to absorb large trades without significant price movements.<p>&gt;Smart contracts are seriously entirely useless unless you solve oracles.<p>Even a basic cryptocurrency transaction (sending ETH from Account 1 to Account 2) utilizes smart contracts.

Success rates vary. Often there are better ways than RICO. And, also, most cases never make it to court.<p>Basically, prosecutors choose the charges they seek to prosecute based on their judgement of the likelihood of conviction; RICO can effectively multiply the number of charges...which some judges are less keen on. There are many factors at play with RICO, but they won&#x27;t clarify anything, so I&#x27;ll leave it there.<p>It is certainly not clear that the DoJ will even prosecute Uber under RICO. Its a possibility, but perhaps not the most likely approach, for a variety of reasons.  That said, its far from impossible. And, some USAs use RICO more than others (eg Preet Bharara).<p>Long story short: criminal investigations &amp; charges are the issue, more than whether they are charged under RICO.

It was an almost perfect storm of young men coming home and others coming of age from the post WW2 era baby boom (1960s, early 70s), and the US inheriting manufacturing dominance which was ideal for employing blue-collar men."

comment,14277053,,,1494020725,,paulmd,"&gt;  What do you think about the idea that people in failed states with unstable currencies would want to store their wealth in Bitcoin?<p>It&#x27;s a stupid idea because there&#x27;s always two parties to any transaction.<p>You know why they don&#x27;t just store their wealth in dollars?  Because nobody is insane enough to sell them dollars for a worthless piece of paper.<p>Bitcoin works the same way.  How much Bitcoin would you give for a Zimbabwe Dollar during hyperinflation?  Obviously none.<p>So you have yet another hard currency that nobody can get ahold of.  What&#x27;s the point, again?<p>&gt;  Or the idea that people would want to use it for international money transfers?<p>I buy things internationally all the time.  It works pretty great, it costs me nothing and it costs the recipient 4.4% plus a fixed $0.30 per sale.<p>Plus if they try and screw me over somehow I get all my money back and try someone else, and they get slapped with a big-ass chargeback fee for being an asshole.  How much are the chargeback fees in the Bitcoin model?  Who do I call to get my money back?<p>Also, I can tell you for sure that Bitcoin costs quite a lot in fees to buy, sell, or trade.  Each transaction is what, $0.50 in fees nowadays?<p>Insofar as Bitcoin represents a single world currency, the problem is that on a macro level this isn&#x27;t a good idea.  Separate currencies that can inflate&#x2F;deflate (i.e. &quot;appreciate&quot; and &quot;depreciate&quot;) are a way to levellize structural imbalances, and without this relief valve you can end up with total collapse instead of just workers who are upset that an iPhone costs $1000.  Inflation is good, it reflects a growing economy, it&#x27;s only when it turns into hyperinflation that this is problematic.<p>For a microcosm of this problem, you can see the ongoing problems with the structural imbalances between Greece and the high-earning German economies over the last 10 years.  If they had currencies that could appreciate and depreciate, Greek labor would be very cheap on the international market.  But since they&#x27;re stuck in the Euro together, they can&#x27;t do that.<p>The growth function for the money supply probably isn&#x27;t optimal either, for these reasons.  The ability to adjust the supply is critical for controlling both inflation and deflation, under various circumstances."

comment,14276867,,,1494018560,,Animats,"We&#x27;ve seen this unsubstantiated denial before on YC, at &quot;Why I’m dropping Rust&quot;[1] and &quot;Rust sucks if I fail to write X&quot;.[2] I once started going through the Rust library packages and listed uses of &quot;unsafe&quot;.  Try doing that.<p>The previous discussions made a few things clear:<p>- The big design-level problems with data structure safety are 1) partially initialized arrays, and 2) backlinks.  The first is needed for growing arrays in Vec, and the second is needed for doubly-linked lists and some kinds of trees.  It&#x27;s very hard to handle either of those in safe Rust. A very small number of packages need unsafe code for those functions, and those should be tightly controlled.<p>- Foreign code remains a problem, and is inherently unsafe when calling unsafe languages. The most downloaded Rust crate is &quot;libc&quot;. What could possibly go wrong there?  Was it really a good idea to import unsafe &quot;strcpy&quot; into Rust?<p><pre><code>    pub fn strcpy(dst: *mut c_char, src: *const c_char) -&gt; *mut c_char;
</code></pre>
- There&#x27;s a lot of use of &quot;unsafe&quot; code that&#x27;s not strictly necessary.
You find unsafe code like &quot;from_utf8_unchecked&quot;, which then turns up in the JSON decoder at (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang-deprecated&#x2F;rustc-serialize&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;json.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang-deprecated&#x2F;rustc-serialize&#x2F;blob...</a>). There are no comments on the safety of that. Is there some way to create bad JSON, get bad UTF-8 into a string, and cause trouble further upstream? I don&#x27;t know, but somebody &quot;optimized&quot; there, and created a potential problem.<p>I could give many more examples.<p>Most of these problems are fixable. They&#x27;re not inherent in Rust.  Fixing them is important to Rust&#x27;s credibility. If Rust is going to replace C++, which it should, the holes have to be plugged. 
It only takes one hole to create a security vulnerability.<p>Denial is not a river in Egypt.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12474445"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12474445</a>

comment,14276864,,,1494018518,,toufka,"Not really.  A single organism (outside of the human race) cannot call the full force of an entire &#x27;environment&#x27; against another species.  And species (outside of humans) must abide by natural laws of energy transfer - for every advance there is an energetic tradeoff. The more different the organism is the easier it would be to target with drugs that only target precisely those differences. The less different, the easier our own bodies would work on it. The more lethal it was, the less it would spread.  The less lethal, the more time there would be to figure it out.  Without bringing to bear the force of an environmental change (shifting the equilibrium or set-point), there is very little that could be biologically catastrophic for the human race.<p>That is not to say that a virulent plague would not be a bad thing for a lot of individuals, if not the human species - but it&#x27;d be pretty challenging to even design worse than already exist out there - HIV, ebola, marburg or smallpox."

You stil have to check the docs&#x2F;source what exactly happens, but it is just one simple function instead of magic methods. And i can keep using plain dicts everywhere.<p>EDIT: To clarify a bit.

comment,14276798,,,1494017907,,eridius,"Sounds to me like the unsafe block had the wrong scope. If safe Rust called a function with a buffer, and that buffer was too small, and that function internally used unsafe code to write to the buffer, then that function is leaking the unsafety past the `unsafe {}` scope, which is incorrect. So that function should be marked as `unsafe`, and the calling code (which calculates the buffer) is then responsible for ensuring that it&#x27;s invoking the unsafe function with an appropriately-sized buffer."

comment,14276714,,,1494017137,,comex,"The main reason it requires unsafe is for memory layout optimizations.  Logically, a hash table is an array of buckets, each of which is either a (hash, key, value) triplet or empty.  The naive representation would be Vec&lt;Option&lt;(usize, K, V)&gt;&gt;, but using Option would significantly increase the size of each bucket: it&#x27;s only a one-byte tag to differentiate between Some and None, but alignment constraints would round the overhead up to at least the alignment of usize, typically 8.  Instead, HashMap stores just (usize, K, V), and considers a bucket empty whenever 0 is stored in the hash slot; if 0 ever comes up as an actual hash value, it&#x27;s changed to a different value before being stored.<p>To the extent I&#x27;ve described it, that <i>might</i> be possible to accomplish in Rust without unsafe code, using a safe abstraction around NonZero (an unsafe type which the compiler assumes will never be zero, allowing it to automatically use a zero value as a marker if the type is found in an enum, such as Option).  However, HashMap goes a step further: it actually stores all the hashes contiguously in one array, and the (K, V) pairs in another.  The nth index in the hashes array and in the (K, V) array together represent a single bucket, but storing them separately makes HashMap&#x27;s typical access patterns somewhat nicer on the CPU&#x27;s cache.  However, this means that slots in the (K, V) array can contain either valid data (of arbitrary types, which might contain pointers etc.) or garbage, depending on a value stored somewhere completely different.  There&#x27;s no good &#x27;automatic&#x27; way to make that safe.<p>I think the use of unsafe code here is fine - it&#x27;s not that hard to audit, and if you don&#x27;t audit you&#x27;re in trouble anyway (hash table DoS is also a security risk) - but in the long term, it would be very interesting if Rust could integrate an optional theorem prover, with the ability to prove arbitrarily complex code safe, given sufficient annotations..."

comment,14276690,,,1494016941,,erikpukinskis,"PHP uses an imperative programming model and has a very clear URL-&gt;source file mapping. This means you can look at the URL, find the source file, start at the top and trace your way to the problem.<p>Node (and Rails, and Java and lots of others) use a declarative router. The app boots. Shit happens. Routes exist. Middleware is involved. There&#x27;s no way to know what code is implicated in a given URL.<p>If you&#x27;re a pro and you can afford to spend a year or so learning framework internals while not getting much done, you develop a sixth sense for where in the codebase an error is likely to be, but you need to spend many weeks and months scratching your head to get there.<p>PHP is much more beginner friendly in this way."

If you could find the port or the phone number and you could guess a username, such as oh I don&#x27;t know: &quot;root&quot;, then you could get in.<p>And people were. We were regularly getting modem calls after hours. We had medical records, private financial data, social insurance numbers, ...<p>It was such a painful work environment. I switched us over by claiming that OpenServer 6 did not have a telnet server and that we were going to have to switch to SSH.

The reason is: the musician is paying the manager, the employee is not.<p>It&#x27;s the chief officers who are paying for the manager.  A manager&#x27;s job is the manage the issues of the officers.  They pay the his or her salary.  The way companies manage employees is to flat out lie about that relationship.

People who believe their culture is the exception that causes employees to be honest with their superiors are naive.<p>What generally happens with strong technical employees is this. While they&#x27;re idealistic and new, they will be relatively honest and direct (simultaneously trying to be polite) for the first couple of years. After a while, they will try to figure out why they&#x27;ve been forced out from their company every 6 months.<p>It will click that maybe the boss didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> mean it when he asked for an inventory of problems and concerns. Maybe all those people who smiled and nodded while a technical &quot;debate&quot; was going on were secretly developing resentment. Maybe people disliked them because their behaviors were interpreted as snobby, arrogant, insensitive, condescending, or detached, despite the politeness with which they delivered their opinions.<p>Then, they will either a) nope out of the career track entirely and become a consultant&#x2F;freelancer&#x2F;entrepreneur; b) lie to themselves and believe they can find the magical land where this doesn&#x27;t happen, which only sets up for a harder fall down the line when you realize no such magical place exists, because people are people everywhere; or c) embrace the realities of human collaboration and try to raise a successful career from the ashes.<p>I&#x27;ve done both A and B. A usually loops back around to a full-time gig at some point. Some people will remain unaware and try to believe in B for the duration of their career. When you exit denial from B, you have to embrace C (even if you loop back to A, C is informative for your ongoing ventures)."

It&#x27;s definitely high-level<p>I agree that it is &quot;high level&quot; and glosses over (purposefully) the nitty-gritty details of the &quot;black boxes&quot; for the most part. I say this as someone who took the first incarnation of the course, which was known as &quot;ML Class&quot; in the fall of 2011, before Coursera came about.<p>Despite it being high-level, though - this is what one of my &quot;classmates&quot; was able to create, about halfway or so thru the course:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.davidsingleton.org&#x2F;nnrccar&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.davidsingleton.org&#x2F;nnrccar&#x2F;</a><p>In 2012, I completed Udacity&#x27;s CS373 course (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;artificial-intelligence-for-r...</a>).<p>Today, I&#x27;m currently in the second term of Udacity&#x27;s Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree (the current lesson I&#x27;m on actually is a part of CS373 - so it&#x27;s a kind of review lesson for me - heh). I&#x27;m having a great time learning about more in-depth understanding and knowledge relating to self-driving vehicles. Much of the learning can be applied to other areas of ML as well (learning how to use and abuse TensorFlow and Keras, for instance).<p>&gt; A big shift in career, from software engineer to &#x27;data scientist (or whatever they call it)&#x27; is probably not possible at my advanced age (37).<p>Don&#x27;t let that stop ya! My plan after finishing this Udacity course is to actually work toward getting my BS and maybe MS in Comp Sci. By that time, I&#x27;ll be well into my 44th year of age. I don&#x27;t know if any of this will lead to a different direction in my career, but that isn&#x27;t something I am really worried or planning about. I&#x27;m currently happy with where my career is; it pays the bills and allows for some fun, too. But if it should lead in another direction, so be it! I figure having this knowledge can&#x27;t hurt me as a employment candidate, and will likely be seen as a plus. Worst case scenario, it will make my hobbyist robotics projects more interesting.<p>I figure I have another 20 or more years in me doing software development (assuming it remains a career option, of course); I personally have met more that a few other developers that age or older who are still making a living at it. So I&#x27;m not ruling out the possibility of a lateral move toward something involving my knowledge of machine learning.<p>Good luck with your studies!"

I think if you get more clear about what you&#x27;re expecting from Penrose you&#x27;ll have a better foothold for why you&#x27;re not getting what you&#x27;re expecting.<p>It does make sense that our ability to understand the incompleteness theorem is very close to self-contradictory -- I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d say it is, without a doubt, self-contradictory; I have not dove deep into how provability logics might force □(a → (p ∧ ¬□p)) into a contradiction, and what you need for that (possibly with reasonable axioms it merely derives ¬□a which just means that if there is an algorithm for understanding then we&#x27;ll never uncover it?).<p>QM does not by itself plug the hole in our understanding; Penrose has never said that to my knowledge. However a tiny part of quantum physics is the only known part of physics that&#x27;s capable of producing nonalgorithmic results (the vast majority of QM is linear algebra in funny hats), hence if we&#x27;ve got a nonalgorithmic result it makes sense to follow our &quot;best theories so far&quot; towards that tiny part of quantum physics."

Most people are living better lives today in the era of High Capitalism than they ever have in the past. As technology growth - spurred by the incentives capitalism generates - continues, and new products and services are created by the capitalist system, people&#x27;s lives will continue to improve.<p>What&#x27;s beautiful about capitalism is that it, through automation, is eliminating drudgery and danger from people&#x27;s work. Eventually when we reach very high levels of automation in society, we may be able to transition to an economy in which people don&#x27;t have to work (much) but still get to own things through universal basic income or some other sort of scheme.<p>So no revolution needed to get us to the promised land folks.

comment,14276249,,,1494013346,,jamesisaac,"I&#x27;d highly recommend using a type system like Flow to enumerate the shape of possible actions the store should support. This brings numerous advantages:<p>1. You can use strings for action types, no more need to import constants.<p>2. No need for action creators for simple actions, you can just create the action object inline and Flow will validate its shape.<p>3. You can be sure that reducers are unpacking properties that actually exist from the actions.<p>In other words, your example could simply be:<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;&#x2F; types.js
    type Action =
      | { type: &#x27;ADD_TODO&#x27;, text: string }

    &#x2F;&#x2F; TodoList.js
    dispatch({ type: &#x27;ADD_TODO&#x27;, text })
</code></pre>
...and Flow would confirm at &#x27;compile time&#x27; that it matches the contract dispatch expects.<p>This approach has scaled up extremely well for me and no longer feels verbose."

I put quotes around science for a reason, because I have a specific example, to wit:<p>Think about alchemy. To a certain extent, a form of scientific process was used by these early - for lack of a better word - proto-chemists. They pondered, came up with ideas, experimented, took notes, compared results, etc. They discovered new substances and compounds we use to this day; they created the prototypes of some of the lab equipment still used. Their methods ultimately led to our current &quot;scientific method&quot; of inquiry.<p>But despite their successes and failures, despite their best attempts and experiments, in many ways they were hampered by the framework of &quot;science&quot; they were investigating. For instance, they knew little to nothing about atoms or elements - instead grouping things into the &quot;classical&quot; elements of earth, fire, water, and air (and in some cases &quot;spirit&quot;). They still had a mindset of &quot;like for like&quot;, meaning that their experimentation led to them using substances or similar that had some nature which was like what they were attempting to perform or gain the result of.<p>I won&#x27;t belabour this point - only to say that because their framework of reference limited them, they couldn&#x27;t make the &quot;giant leap&quot; forward that was needed to really understand and do what it is they were trying to do (let&#x27;s not dwell on the philosophical&#x2F;spiritual aspects of the so-called Philosopher&#x27;s Stone quest).<p>So perhaps that&#x27;s where we are today, in regards to science and trying to explain and understand consciousness? That isn&#x27;t to say we won&#x27;t eventually be able to explain and explore the topic; our nature of asking questions, trying experiments, coming at the problem from a myriad of different angles, and the collaboration between these disparate fields will likely lead us to the knowledge (and also it will open up many more questions, as it always has and does). As noted in the article, we are taking more steps even today - and I am also pleased to see that there is a greater collaboration going on between the fields and people who deal with this at a basic level - the physicists, the neuroscientists, computer science, biologists, etc. This kind of cross-fertilization is absolutely needed in order to understand this problem."

And when I do need to be more mobile, phones handle that aspect just as well and maybe better if I need to be able to put said mobile device is a smaller-than-tablet-pocket. I think in the long term, the extent of tablets will largely be some kind of pseudo-tablet convertibles like the aforementioned ZenBook and probably fewer like the Transformer of the Surface Book and most tablets that do stick around with be Surface like holdouts that can&#x27;t more easily be converted into real computer mode."

comment,14276165,,,1494012571,,eridius,"An &quot;open&quot; platform is still a platform with lock-in. The only thing &quot;open&quot; does is allow other vendors to decide if they want to support that platform too. But, for example, you can&#x27;t take a web site and use it on a platform that doesn&#x27;t support web pages (e.g. you can&#x27;t browse the web on an AppleTV).<p>&gt; <i>Problem with Apple and MS is that they use the later on purpose.</i><p>There are really significant downsides to open platforms. They&#x27;re harder to build, develop <i>much</i> more slowly, generally have a big issue with multiple implementations not actually behaving identically (just look at the development of the web for a plethora of examples), end up being design-by-committee which usually ends up as a worst-of-all-worlds design, etc. Companies like Apple and MS build closed platforms because that ends up being <i>hugely</i> better for their users. They don&#x27;t do this out of a desire to have lock-in, lock-in is just a natural consequence of using closed platforms."

Compartmentalization helps this somewhat, even if it initially looks like the opposite.<p>You can still build a hot rod without too much advanced knowledge.  Want to include anti-lock brakes?  What about traction control?  What about variable valve timing?  At some point even the savants will start acquiring whole systems to drop in as needed, as needed.  Systemd is to sysinit what a brand new aluminum or magnesium alloy modern engine is to a 70&#x27;s cast iron engine.  It&#x27;s not something you want to mess with too much, and it has a bunch of inputs and outputs you probably don&#x27;t care about, but it&#x27;s designed for what it&#x27;s used for.  If I was buying a new car, I want the modern engine unless I expect to need to do a bunch of maintenance myself.<p>This is the normal progression technology takes.  It&#x27;s fine to still run your own distro, just as it&#x27;s fine to build your own car, but let&#x27;s not delude ourselves into thinking the custom distro not the hot rod are just as good <i>general purpose</i> devices, even if they may well be better for a specific subset of things (and that subset may well fit what you care about)."

comment,14275742,,,1494009391,,psadauskas,"My 2012 MBP is getting a bit long in the tooth, and had several software-ish issues that were totally unfixable. As a long time Linux user, I decided to switch back, and purchased a powerful laptop to replace it. I did a similar survey of distros, and haven&#x27;t been happy with any of them.<p>Ubuntu worked fairly well in a vanilla configuration, but as a developer, I prefer a more powerful and customizable desktop UI. My preferred window manager is awesomewm, but trying to get it to integrate with Unity or Gnome-shell is pretty much impossible. If I run just bare awesome, I lose all the power management &amp; audio niceties. I can probably set it all back up, but documentation on how to do so is slim. Additionally, installing newer software than what is provided by apt is a giant pain. You basically have to hope the vendor provides their own apt repository for you to use, and that they&#x27;ve updated it for Zesty.<p>Arch linux was by far my favorite before I switched to OSX ~10 years ago. It always has the latest software available in core. Additionally, AUR provides betas and even more esoteric software. Anything I come across here or on reddit probably already has an AUR package for it, and in the rare case it does not, it is trivial to write a PKGBUILD for it. However, installing Arch is way harder than it used to be, particularly on laptops. There&#x27;s so much variety and complexity in hardware now, you could spend a month getting everything set up and it still would not be satisfactory. Power management, sound, full-disk-encryption, webcam, display hot-plugging, hardware sensors...<p>I used Fedora for quite awhile on a desktop before I got this laptop, and really enjoyed it. However, the latest Fedora uses wayland for everything, which doesn&#x27;t work with the closed nvidia drivers, and nouveau on the 1070 in this laptop basically doesn&#x27;t work. However, `dnf` is 10x better than `apt`, and I found it much easier to find copr repositories for updated software. Maybe I&#x27;ll revisit once wayland and nvidia work together.<p>I wish there was a distro half-way in between Arch and Ubuntu&#x2F;Fedora. A nice installer that autodetects and sets up hardware automatically, but still easy to hack on. The problem with the former, though, is you pretty much need the resources of Canonical or Red Hat to get it done.<p>Also, for the record, I love systemd. I&#x27;ve been using unixes for 20 years, and never managed to grok init scripts that I was comfortable creating or modifying them. Systemd (like Upstart and Launchd before it) is a huge improvement over that mess."

I think it&#x27;s less about the choice of tool, and more about designers who know what&#x27;s possible in HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. I think that HTML mockups are valuable (especially for reusing components and experimenting with interactivity and responsiveness), but Photoshop and Illustrator provide speed of experimentation that HTML&#x2F;CSS is miles away from. Blocking out layouts and text in illustrator is mechanically trivial, and requires little planning - with HTML I need to actually plan out how my flexboxes and HTML structures are going to work out, and that just slows down experimentation and iteration.<p>Personally, I start in Illustrator, then move into HTML as the designs solidify. My Illustrator mockups are nearly identical to my HTML because I understand the limitations I&#x27;m working with (or psuedo limitations, since you can do most anything with SVG - but it might be a pain in the ass)."

comment,14275697,,,1494009045,,raulk,"JBI déjà vu. I see some parallelism between this JSR and the Java Business Integration (JBI, JSR-208) JSR back in 2005.<p>Instead of building a standard for integration, they ended up specifying a standard for interoperability between integration components from different vendors, i.e. a &quot;meta&quot;-integration system (using the same term as the author).<p>The result was a spec that allowed an (a) HTTP adapter from Oracle to exchange data with a (b) File adapter from IBM – through (c) an ESB implemented by TIBCO, for example. Essentially something that nobody would even think of deploying (in the era of proprietary, expensive and lock-in middleware).<p>Obviously the standard was DOA and had very little traction. Not even the JSR members implemented it. The only memorable implementation was Apache ServiceMix, which later transitioned to OSGi, spinning off its kernel as Apache Karaf.<p>In hindsight, the vendors might have acted like trojan horses with JBI, steering the spec into a territory that would be ultimately worthless.<p>The lesson to learn is that commercial vendors don&#x27;t gain anything by standardising on those elements they consider strategic differentiators (like their module system).<p>EDIT: minor edits for clarity."

comment,14275610,,,1494008409,,Sir_Cmpwn,"&gt;I have 878 unique shared libraries shared between currently running processes on my Linux laptop at this moment, with the amount of processes sharing a library ranging from 2 processes to 820. Most may have few in common, but there are a lot of them, and the mean is 62, mode is 4.<p>Good god, this tells half the story. An agunix install booted to a shell will typically only have 3 processes running: runit, a getty, and your shell. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> had more than 50 processes running on my agunix system at any given moment.<p>&gt;As far as the botched update argument: When does anybody botch an update of a shared library? When they&#x27;re forcing something to install, or they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>For any number of reasons. This has happened to me dozens of times in the past year. You also run into issues with any software you compiled yourself that aren&#x27;t managed by the package manager (or at least not supported by your distro). You know what&#x27;s better? An executable that works on any Linux system and will continue to work for the next 20 years without any changes. How about running two executables that need different versions of a library?<p>&gt;On the other hand, mis-matches in applications using different versions of the same code causes silent, unexpected, difficult to debug errors.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into this yet. Have you?<p>&gt;I&#x27;d also be interested in seeing actual &quot;RAM and disk footprint&quot; numbers as a comparison for the same applications and libraries, because that doesn&#x27;t really make sense. Even if applications only copy a couple small functions each, they add up, whereas the shared library only has one copy.<p>My laptop is currently running runit, 8 gettys, sshd, wpa_supplicant, crond, udevd, and dhcpcd. It&#x27;s using 60 MiB of RAM. So far as disk footprint is concerned, see package sizes at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repo.agunix.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repo.agunix.org&#x2F;</a>. Base system is ~350 MiB on disk and there&#x27;s still room for improvement.<p>From the agunix home page:<p>&gt;Our first concern is to build a lightweight POSIX environment - a familiar design for users familiar with other Linux distributions is not our goal.<p>It&#x27;s better to think of this as a new operating system entirely than as a new Linux distro."

Although late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia, early deaths exhibited extremely “wet,” sometimes hemorrhagic lungs. The hypothesis presented herein is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0–31.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33% and 3% of recipients, respectively. Recently, pulmonary edema was found at autopsy in 46% of 26 salicylate-intoxicated adults. Experimentally, salicylates increase lung fluid and protein levels and impair mucociliary clearance. In 1918, the US Surgeon General, the US Navy, and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended use of aspirin just before the October death spike. If these recommendations were followed, and if pulmonary edema occurred in 3% of persons, a significant proportion of the deaths may be attributable to aspirin.&quot;

But if multiple components in various parts of your app are making similar kinds of calls, it makes sense to manage it centrally, with a file or set of files that can handle common actions."

comment,14275526,,,1494007734,,nugget,"I am a fan of Ethereum but I wish they (and other alt-coins) would be honest about the fact that there is very much a central authority at work; in Ethereum&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s a small network of developers and mining pools.  That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but let&#x27;s at least be honest about it. 
 Admit that central authorities have a role to play (and may take many different forms).  Recent events clearly reflect, to me at least, that the value of a blockchain doesn&#x27;t depend upon the lack of a central authority (indeed, investors may feel safer with a steady hand on the wheel) or immutability (Ethereum violated supposed rule #1 and look at how the market has voted, i.e. ETH&#x2F;ETC price variance)."

comment,14275475,,,1494007346,,zimablue,"I can think of a couple of reasons:
    safety, attr access by .&lt;thing&gt; means you knew what you wanted at write-time, so it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that you&#x27;re gonna want to know if it doesn&#x27;t exist, and not just want to roll the dice on passing a null along.
    language concision, it seems counterintuitive but attrs vs items gives you two options for one class: . access and [] access, which it&#x27;s very reasonable give different results, so your default mode of writing classes has a &quot;I think this should be here&#x2F;nondynamic&quot; mode of access and a &#x27;wonder if this is here&#x27;&#x2F;dynamic mode of access. I think that there are benefits to that. If you don&#x27;t eventually do some dynamic attribute access I think you throw away an advantage of dynamic languages, but it&#x27;s nice to me that there&#x27;s this by default soft line between less and more dynamic code"

But I actually don&#x27;t like any of the regulations you mentioned.<p>The most egregious is this one:<p><i>cab drivers from city A may drive passengers to city B, but not pick up passengers in city B. Once again, this is not just to protect taxi drivers in city B (because the meter in taxi A may have lower tariffs), but also to ensure a competent driver for passengers in city B.</i><p>This is almost always a rule to protect cab drivers in city B.  And it&#x27;s horribly inefficient as it means the cab spends 50% of its time empty.  If driving between cities is common, fares have to be much, much higher to compensate drivers for this.<p>Knowledge of local roads is close to ok, it ties into being a good driver.  The other items on your list are nice-to-haves, but at what cost?  If tourists really want all this stuff, they can take the cab at the stand outside their hotel or at the airport instead of calling an Uber.  But, speaking for myself, I&#x27;d prefer to save 10-20 euro on a trip from the airport.<p>Disclaimer: the closest I have come to Germany is flying through the airports.

Apologies for the late reply, I also have a day job ;)<p>I would recommend Krugman&#x27;s Conscience of a Liberal for an entertaining read. He referenced another book, aptly called Inequality[1], which I&#x27;m currently going through. Its a little more academic prose so its not something I can finish quickly (in short, its not an entertaining read...not that all books have to be of course).<p>Both of these books examine historical precedents for income inequality and attempt to analyze the current situation as well. I think they did a fair job, although I am open to change my mind if there is a better explanation. But these and other books, such as Dark Money[2], and just general news about the scummy activities of people like the Koch brothers have made me more convinced of this viewpoint.<p>Now to address your comment...<p>&gt; Only a minority of companies in the US even have executives that get the much maligned high pay and bonuses in the last decade or so. What about the massive percentage of wealth that didn&#x27;t fall into this category? They may have gain significantly from globalism but that was hardly the result of US tax policy alone.<p>This is most certainly not true [0]. From [0] and from Krugman&#x27;s book, you can see just how much the changes in tax policy has incentivized ballooning executive pay and created a new class of executives, who may not be as rich as the landed&#x2F;inherited, but are certainly &quot;rich&quot;. And this class has grown and become more enriched due to globalism, the opening of foreign markets and plummeting of labor costs, both due to automation and cheap foreign labor. I almost think of it as a weird form of trickle down effect, where most of the wealth goes to the very rich but a little (relatively insignificant but in absolute terms very much so) trickles down to the executive class.<p>&gt; Lets not forget that democrats were in power for the last 8yrs and the state has only grown exponentially since the 1990s under both republican and democrat governments. Just because tax rates weren&#x27;t the extremes of pre-1980&#x2F;1970s doesn&#x27;t make them low. They&#x27;ve been relatively consistent while the middle class income dropped.<p>Yes Democrats were in power for 8 years but how many of their policies could not be enacted due to obstructionism? But lets not get into that area here: 8 years is a relatively small time to create&#x2F;destroy inequality. And I don&#x27;t see any Democrats pushing for tax cuts on the rich, especially cutting estate taxes, which affect only the very rich.<p>&gt; The complexity of the tax code and lack of competitiveness with international countries may have heavily influenced inequality. But it was hardly the result of explicit tax reduction for the rich...<p>Its not the complexity of the tax code but its very nature. The top tax rate for personal income is around 35% in the US whereas it is much higher in other developed economies. And the sources that I&#x27;ve listed point to historical trends that prove the same point: once you have a class of super wealthy, they will inevitably influence the Government to reduce their tax burden no matter how that is achieved.<p>&gt; The idea that tax havens are something that were merely a matter of weak policy is naive. Even worse than the drug war hawks.<p>I don&#x27;t think that comparison achieves anything but hyperbole so I&#x27;m not going to comment on it.<p>&gt; Just because the middle class didn&#x27;t keep pace with the wealthy doesn&#x27;t mean only the wealthy were at fault. The fact the middle class lost wealth is hardly singularly the fault of the wealthy. I know this narrative sells well in politics but it&#x27;s very short sighted.<p>I think you&#x27;re conflating wealth with income. The middle class, by their definition, is not wealthy (at least in the same country; middle class in US is most certainly <i>more</i> wealthy than in India, say). The US middle class hasn&#x27;t lost wealth, its their incomes that have not been growing as fast as the incomes of the wealthy. Its unfortunately not just politics: investments in people reap great benefits for society. If a country fails to invest in the health and education of its citizenry because its unable to raise the revenue to do so by the wealthy, then its most certainly the fault of the rich.<p>&gt; Even if the US adjusted tax policy to redistribute a larger chunk of taxes towards the middle class it would hardly make a dent in the new reality in the fact there is hardly a middle class economy like there used to be. So you must either develop a new middle class economy or you get temporary perks of taking it from the wealthy. This is the big whale in the room that the Bernie bro guys are ignoring. The likely scenario is that the wealthy would become continually less competitive over the years, shift way more money over seas, and the middle class would be in the same situation with a little bit more money for a short period.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is likely. Sure its a changed reality now, and I certainly don&#x27;t see what other future markets will open up, but this new reality demands a healthy, educated workforce to operate it. Income redistribution is less about taking from wealthy and giving it to the poor as much as taking from the wealthy and investing in institutions&#x2F;programs that can assist the most vulnerable in society. More taxation by itself won&#x27;t make the wealthy less competitive... I mean, how does that even happen? On the contrary: educating a kid from Inner City Detroit might give us the next Steve Jobs.<p>&gt; Gov spending under any administration that enacts those policies would largely offset most of the gains going directly to the people regardless (which is good if it results in universal health care, but little else if it&#x27;s not sustainable).<p>You seem to imply that all Govt. spending is wasteful which is most certainly not true. Surely its not perfect, but that&#x27;s another problem that needs fixing.<p>Also, you asked for a source but failed to provide a single one for any of the many many assertions that you have made.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pay-without-Performance-Unfulfilled-Compensation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0674022289"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pay-without-Performance-Unfulfilled-C...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Inequality-What-Can-Be-Done&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0674504763"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Inequality-What-Can-Be-Done&#x2F;dp&#x2F;067450...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307947904"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radic...</a>"
comment,14275337,,,1494006476,,merb,"&gt; Should we further delay this JSR—possibly for years—in order to gain “closer consensus” by pursuing a different goal that will likely result in a design so bloated and complex that no working developer would ever use it<p>this.
I don&#x27;t see a reason to even delay Java 9 more. It&#x27;s really really really silly. Yes no solution is perfect, but most of the time when somebody want to make something perfect and actually implement everything for everybody, they fail or it ends up in super complicated stuff.
Java 10 and Java 11 looks promising, maybe more promising than 9 but 9 also has promising things and the module system might emerge into something super useful, if not - is that the end of the world? prolly not.<p>java has a extreme amount of bloat when it comes to releases, even more than the language itself. a lot of it are policits and still I hope that they change their &quot;3-5 years till next release&quot;-model soon! I mean there aren&#x27;t many languages that are developed in the open and have such a aweful time frame.
the best model is prolly used by rust. smaller iterations  and some other channels a la chrome.
it&#x27;s really sad that the language gets so much hindered by akward polictics"

comment,14275286,,,1494006077,,malkia,"1. I&#x27;m trying to be serious, but I often lose touch. My wife is more in control of the matter.<p>2. I&#x27;m not sure teaching is the best way to describe it... more like doing it together, and sharing knowledge. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a good teacher (after seen how others do it). Occasionally I pull real good &quot;teachin&#x27;&quot; - seriously, but then often I fell into too many details, and he gets bored.<p>3. Maybe, but possibly when he goes to middleschool.<p>I grew up in Bulgaria, and since 7th grade I was in specialized Mathematics and Informatics (the &quot;eu&quot; word for &quot;computer science&quot;) high-school. I went there because I was good in my elementary, middle school... only to realize I was just average, or even below compared to the other kids. But then I discovered that programming is what I really wanted, unlike many of the other kids (that was back in the 90s), and there was much less competition in this area. Nowadays its quite different... Back then, even saying that you were playing video games, and kids would consider you dork&#x2F;geek&#x2F;etc.<p>But back to math-specialized high-school - Since I&#x27;ve started doing poorly, my parents got me 1-1 (sometimes 1-2) math teacher, just to keep on level. It was the norm to have 30-40 math exams for homework, and it took everyone of us hours to finish (Though one difference with schools here, is that there is rotation when you go to school - one month you go in the morning, the other month in the afternoon - so there was plenty of time to finish homework).<p>So, it&#x27;s definitely beneficial to have an instructor. It helped me. We are considering, but also from another standpoint - peer pressure. When all our friends are talking about how their kids go with private tutors&#x2F;instructors - then you have to get on that bandwagon... I mean I hate that, but I know we have to do it.<p>Last rant, I wish a classroom where the teacher would have only few kids - 5-6, not 20. I feel this would greatly reduce the need for instructors.<p>And I&#x27;m willing to pay more taxes, whether I had or had not kids."

comment,14275181,,,1494005413,,eximius,I have not because I don&#x27;t write C professionally. We generally have things that require algorithmic improvements due to the scale - language doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>C&#x27;s model requires you to understand the machine model. Haskell presumably requires you to understand the machine model (but less thoroughly) but understand the compiler&#x27;s model also. It&#x27;s a little more but comparable. So complaining only about the Haskell runtime just seems ironic to me.

Parties representing religious groups wanted the start delayed till after Passover and the end to precede Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, while the secular parties would argue for starting it earlier and ending it later.<p>Sounds like business as usual for a modern 2-party state.  What was more interesting to me, as a programmer, was the next line:<p>&gt; In the past, the unpredictability of IDT in Israel became frustrating enough that Microsoft Windows stopped trying to track changes and just made Israeli time be Greenwich Mean Time plus two hours (GMT+2) (and disabled the daylight saving option). This has led to various ad hoc solutions to the problem in Windows systems and other Microsoft software (e.g. Outlook calendar entries are often off by an hour when shared, due to the lack of IDT support). On November 17, 2009, Microsoft released an update that has daylight saving time enabled for Israel. However, the date for transition back to Standard Time is set as the Second Sunday of September, regardless of the Hebrew Calendar date.[4] Windows 7 does contain correct IDT times up to 2023, but not all software makes use of this extra information.<p>OK, I know that I&#x27;m supposed to just import my system date&#x2F;time library for timekeeping functions.  Because it&#x27;s too complicated for mortals like me, while Microsoft, Apple, Google, and other major institutions can handle all the inanities.<p>But Microsoft gave up on this one? Ouch."

But previously you wrote:<p>&gt;<i>and so geothermal plants are generally only built in areas that require shallow (1km) wells</i><p>That sounds like your &quot;30 years&quot; number there is for shallow wells. Intuitively it doesn&#x27;t seem like this logic would necessarily be identical for deeper wells: obviously at some depth the rock is <i>always</i> extremely hot (or, in fact, molten). The article seems to indicate that they expect a deeper well to produce higher temperatures and pressures, in turn allowing more energy production, and that seems like it&#x27;d make sense. Maybe 1km vs 5km makes no difference in lifetime beyond that, but does your analysis include deep wells already in an equivalent area? Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to extrapolate past lifetimes of shallow wells to future lifetimes of deep wells, even ignoring that they say they&#x27;ll be able to achieve far higher energy generation per well."

You can build it from the inside out, or top-down, or bottom-up. You can make it monolithic, or modularize it. You can do all of these things at once, if you want!<p>There was a commercial more than a few years back that illustrated something about &quot;how clients want things done&quot; vs &quot;how things are done&quot; - I think it was for insurance, IIRC. Basically, they showed a &quot;modern construction of a pyramid&quot; in some &quot;city&quot;. It was a complicated construct; but apparently the client wanted it constructed from the top down! So there was this huge gantry crane like system, hanging the apex of the pyramid, and other stuff going on with workers and machines gradually building downward to the base...<p>You can&#x27;t do this physically, of course (though I am aware of people who try to get engineers to do this - it&#x27;s actually a common thing in custom home building for a client to change their mind in the middle of a project and want a window or door moved a few feet over - and trying to get them to understand what that would change in the already-in-place infrastructure of wiring, plumbing, etc - not to mention demolition, re-engineering, permits, inspections, etc - but some clients have enough money and clout and hubris to insist on it).<p>But you can do this with software. When it&#x27;s done in the middle of a project (because of design changes, or to fix issues), we call it refactoring. It is this malleability of software that makes it easier to work with to express complicated constructs; there isn&#x27;t any comparison to physical mechanical systems.<p>Such systems, as exemplified by horological mechanisms, require careful planning of where parts are put for their relative functions, and in relationship to the rest of the device, and how those parts are put together, what order, layers, etc. Not to mention the various calculations and allowances needed for tolerances, forces, friction, lubrication, as well as simply the fasteners and framework holding the whole thing together!<p>We haven&#x27;t even considered taking into account external forces, and how they relate to the accuracy and&#x2F;or longevity of the system. All of these things, and many more, apply to all mechanical systems, and require careful planning and execution. Fortunately (especially for many of these complex timepieces of today, as I am led to believe by the reading of a few of these kinds of articles), master watchmakers like these have at their disposal modern CAD&#x2F;CAM systems to aid them in planning and designing these complex works of art, as well as to guide them in assembly of them. Even with such help, though, I imagine that the process is still a very consuming and maddening one (this is evidenced by the fact of how long it takes for these craftspeople to build only a few of these timepieces). Now imagine having to do this without such help! Not as complex (but still pretty insane given the time period) timepieces (and other mechanical clockwork devices and automata) were planned, design, calculated, drawn, and constructed by hand in the past, long before computers were available - some of which contained thousands of carefully crafted and assembled parts; many of these devices still exist and operate today.<p>Interestingly - very little of our software that we construct today is likely to still be operating 100 or more years from now (though there are a few examples that are working their way to that point)..."

In this project, we are gonna build a game like &quot;Overwatch&quot; using: Unreal Engine 4, Maya, UV Layout, Photoshop, Quixel, Substance Painter 2, Substance Designer. This is going to be a very funny project . if you want to learn how to develop your own game then you are on the right stream.
This tutorial will cover all the details (resources, tools, languages etc) that are necessary to develop a game like Overwatch. You will be guided through all the steps and concepts, starting from the basic ones like setting up the right tools and programs for development. And ultimately you will be able to create your own shooter game like Overwatch.

How to prevent a bomb explodes a day before the deadline?<p>If you discover problems close to the deadline, you already have a big problem. My opinion is that these daily meeting are to prevent problems, like integration between systems.<p>People are comfortable on their own doings, they don&#x27;t like meetings, they prefer a problem occurs and share the blame than doing daily meetings. We must do daily meetings because it&#x27;s good for the project and not because we enjoy it, we do to avoid that some lazy or introvert collaborator don&#x27;t share a problem that can affect everybody.<p>That&#x27;s why we have a scrum master to do the dirty job and assure everyone is talking each other."

That is what is meant by, &quot;Data is the new oil,&quot; - it has nothing to do with the actual perceived or actual value of oil or data, but rather the idea that while it is impossible to compete with these companies. The Economist goes on to state that it is no proponent of trust-busting because, &quot;size is not a crime,&quot; as they put it so therefore we have to regulate the capture of data in different ways."

comment,14274908,,,1494003482,,jsmthrowaway,"That&#x27;s a tough preference with Python, because of the semantics of what [] and . mean and how ingrained those semantics are in the language. Put another way, the following should hold:<p><pre><code>       x.y == x.__getattr__(&quot;y&quot;)
    x[&quot;y&quot;] == x.__getitem__(&quot;y&quot;)
    assignment == set{attr,item}
    del x.y, del x[&quot;y&quot;], etc
    len() and slices of items, not attrs
</code></pre>
etc, etc. If you start messing with those semantics, it can become very confusing very quickly in Python and you probably want a data type. Remember that Python gets nervous about cleverness.<p>One way I&#x27;ve approached your problem before is a recursive helper where I borrowed some concepts from jq:<p><pre><code>    val = fetch(result_dict, &quot;foo.bar.baz.plonk[0]&quot;)
</code></pre>
Because then you can also isolate the missing key handling and all that stuff into your helper, rather than changing the semantics of an untyped dict. Aside from typing the responses from APIs -- the way better option -- I found this a reasonably Pythonic approach toward dealing with the annoyance."

comment,14274803,,,1494002725,,Bumerang,"Having exactly the same background (system programming, linux, c&#x2F;c++, python, never touched Javascript nor web development) I did the very same recently.<p>My solution was to use Django (DRF) for REST API and React for the front-end and Zurb Foundation as UI framework. Javascript is really easy to pick up and there are plenty of tools and tutorials available out there. Used Facebook JS SDK for FB login and sharing (because it&#x27;s easy and ready to go, plus FB is popular enough to make the effort worth). I also used JWT for auth and session management, just to explore it and because it seemed simple enough for my purposes. Django will solve most of the security concerns for you.<p>In total, took me ~4 months while working full time to wrap my head around everything and build the website + deployment (Nginx, Fabric, Celery, supervisor... all the usual stuff)."

If you can&#x27;t buy anything with a currency, it&#x27;s not a currency.&quot;<p>This is the one that really sticks out to me. What do people need any of this for? I think they did a fine job pitching the value of smart contract &#x2F; blockchain technology. But why do I, or a bank, or society need anything beyond those?<p>The tech may be useful, but what 99% of these discussions come down to is whether you think a decentralized currency and disintermediated payments system have value. I don&#x27;t really see the need for the vast majority of society to have the former in the long run, and I think the latter is actively harmful and impractical. Like you pointed out, you&#x27;re inevitably going to have these code failures, disagreements, etc. Those are basic failures of any human-designed and human-negotiated system. As far as those go, I still prefer to wager my business on the time-worn technology of English common law.<p>As far as the tech goes, yes, banks should get behind some of this.

comment,14274695,,,1494002007,,amyjess,"The key is not that your motivation is simply ideological but that it&#x27;s rooted in widely-acknowledged concepts of social justice. And it&#x27;s not even &quot;are you a corporation or are you human?&quot; but &quot;are you fighting for social justice or to line your pockets with cash?&quot;. We can distill that down further to &quot;who benefits more: society or your wallet?&quot;.<p>To steal an example from rayiner elsewhere in this thread, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a restaurant in the segregation-era south in a jurisdiction that requires restaurants to have separate seating areas for white and black people. Let&#x27;s say you decide to break the law by having a single seating area for everyone. That would be civil disobedience because you&#x27;re going out of your way to improve conditions for marginalized people at considerable risk, not just of prosecution but of being boycotted by racists. In other words, you breaking the law benefits society more than it benefits you.<p>This isn&#x27;t what Uber is doing. Sure, let&#x27;s say that Travis is ideologically motivated because he feels he has a fundamental natural right to make money using any and every means he sees fit. So that means Uber is breaking the law because they feel the law gets in the way of their natural right to line their pockets with as much cash as they can however they can. It&#x27;s a purely selfish motivation.<p>And moving on to Ross, it&#x27;s the same thing. He was raking in bitcoins hand over fist from what he was doing. He can say &quot;selling anything should be legal&quot; all he wants, but if the end result of him breaking the law is that he gets rich, then he&#x27;s ultimately doing himself a favor more than he&#x27;s doing society a favor. And he really shot himself in the foot with those attempted hits. That took all the wind out of the sails of his &quot;I&#x27;m not hurting anyone; I&#x27;m just helping connect people to each other&quot;. He tried to kill people. Worse, he tried to kill people <i>because they stole money from him</i>. There was no ideological motivation for the attempted hits. It was just &quot;this guy stole from me, he has to pay&quot;. There goes his entire defense.<p>And ultimately, &quot;civil disobedience&quot; isn&#x27;t a defense against conviction. It&#x27;s an argument for leniency in the sentencing phase. It doesn&#x27;t exist on paper, either: the only reason the concept exists at all is because judges and juries have broad discretion in sentencing. It&#x27;s just like how first-time offenders tend to get off easy: there&#x27;s no law saying &quot;if the convicted has no priors, you have to give them a lesser sentence&quot;, it&#x27;s just based on the logic that someone with no priors is probably someone who made a stupid mistake and not a career criminal. Going back to civil disobedience, the upshot is that if you can convince the judge and&#x2F;or jury that you breaking the law had a net benefit to society, you might get away with the minimum punishment mandated by law. But if the main consequence of you breaking the law is that you got rich, why would any judge or jury care enough to let you off easily?<p>Edit: Just to make this clear, IANAL &amp; TINLA."

Not to mention it also depends on personaility types; you may have an employee who is fairly comfortable answering that sort of question with complete honesty. But more often that not, you will find that they probably haven&#x27;t had chance to get up-to-speed with their work environment or gain a thorough understanding of how the dev team operates.<p>You would probably get more benefit by asking questions that are more related to company culture, such as, how they&#x27;re settling into the team, how they find the team morale&#x2F;company culture, who in the team has provided them the most value so far. Those type of questions would hopefully help the new hire understand that you care about the culture at the company and also helps build a more personal relationship, which consequently will build trust between you and your employees to allow them to truthfully answer your initial question a few months later when they are more embedded into the team.<p>Definitely keep up the regular engagements with new hires though, despite not necessarily receiving the answers you&#x27;re looking for."

Then you resolve the blockage outside of the standup, in a longer, deeper discussion with fewer people.<p>Project tracking should be in a Kanban board (or digital equivalent, such as Jira or TFS). This should be used by the dev&#x27;s so that they know what work is queued up, what work is in process and who&#x27;s working on it, and what is completed, so that they can do their jobs. In an agile team most of the management is externalized onto a Kanban board - the team manages itself most of the time, using the Kanban board to have a shared understanding of what&#x27;s going on. A secondary benefit is that outsiders can look at the Kanban board to assess progress, without consuming any dev time.<p>The &quot;subtle pressure&quot; on the dev to deliver is a great point. In fact, when status is completely transparent, developers put a great deal of pressure on themselves to deliver, because they want to honor their commitments, and there&#x27;s a social pressure not to be &quot;that guy&quot; that blows the sprint."

comment,14274431,,,1494000163,,devrandomguy,"I&#x27;m probably no more knowledgeable than you in this area, but I have a free morning, and this is interesting. My hypothesis, is that the heat that we produce or release to generate usable energy, is an insignificant factor in global warming, compared to the solar heat that we trap with greenhouse gases. Let&#x27;s find some quick simple stats and do some arithmetic, to figure out how much we are directly heating the surface of the Earth.<p>According to Wikipedia, the global energy production for 2012 was about 5.616e+20 joules, or 156 petawatt-hours. The Earth has about 1.386e+21 liters of water on it, and I will assume that that water represents the bulk of the relevant thermal mass, when considering weather patterns and sea level.<p>Now, let&#x27;s estimate the heating caused by that energy. According to www.bickfordscience.com&#x2F;03-05_State_Changes&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;Specific_Heat.pdf, 4,184 Joules of energy applied to 1 KG of water will raise its temperature by 1 degree Celsius, and this scales linearly with mass. Assuming that Earth-water averages out a density of 1 KG per liter, our 5.616e+20 joules, applied over a year to our 1.386e+21 liter water mass, would heat that water by 1.036e-38 degrees Celcius.<p>It has been a while since I&#x27;ve done a dimensional analysis, and the scale here are so extreme that I can&#x27;t tell if my result is sensible. However, if my assumptions are reasonable and my math is correct, and the processes that I have chosen to ignore are insignificant (i.e. radiation into space over one year), then all of the heat that we release in the generation of the global energy supply, has a negligible impact on the temperature of the planet."

In it, he goes over many different schemes of generating things.<p>My favorites are the ones he calls &quot;loopless&quot; since they do not have a loop during each iteration of the algorithm.  So, in this example, there is no need for the filter line that will ultimately have to loop (or hash or something else not trivial) to find the items to filter out).  In particular, to generate all permutations of binary digits requires something like 4 assignments and one test for each iteration.<p>The ridiculously interesting ones are based on De Bruijn sequences.  Basically, think if you have a combination lock that constantly shifts in 1 character when you type.  Is it possible to test all combinations of digits without &quot;wasting&quot; a keypress?"

Once the alternatives become cheaper, it&#x27;s better both economically and environmentally to distance away from Saudi oil.<p>Sure Saudi can make oil cheap as dirt to combat alternatives but then they aren&#x27;t making as much money. I don&#x27;t foresee a scenario that in 20 years Saudi oil demand will keep on rising.<p>Their entire economy is based on natural resources. Not a great place to be."

comment,14274380,,,1493999790,,tooker,"It used to irritate me having to use alternative grammar for accessing values in a mapping vs accessing object attributes.  However this is an area where I learned to appreciate Python&#x27;s hardline on consistency.  Guido in particular has been responsible for keeping the language predictable and concise by disallowing patterns like this in the language itself.  So on one hand it&#x27;s beautiful that it&#x27;s so easy to implement things like this (which I am guilty of doing too), but on the other it is a perversion of the intentional distinction between attributes and mappings.<p>I&#x27;ve since learned to love the distinction between object attributes and items in a mapping and happily implement [&#x27;this style&#x27;] accessors without complaint now.<p>That being said, if the library just did difflib.get_close_matches() on the key lookup that would be neat for some use cases where you want fuzzy keep lookup."

comment,14274320,,,1493999394,,acemarke,"Perf optimization is a big benefit, yes, but it also fits with functional programming principles in general.<p>React&#x27;s `setState()` definitely doesn&#x27;t care if you mutate or not - you can `.push()` right into an existing array in state, and re-set it into state to queue the re-render.<p>On the Redux side of things, immutability is important for several reasons.  First, pure reducer functions are more easily testable.  Second, they enable time-travel debugging - without immutability, jumping back and forth in state would cause the state contents to behave unpredictably, breaking time-travel.  Third, the React-Redux `connect` function relies on immutability checks against the root of the state tree to see if it _thinks_ anything has changed, and against the return values of your `mapState` functions as well.  If you mutate Redux state, your connected components usually won&#x27;t re-render properly, because they think nothing has changed."

comment,14274302,,,1493999287,,soapdog,"I think what they are saying is not that you can&#x27;t type without looking at the screen, is that you can&#x27;t use a touchscreen without glancing it at some time. For example: is the keyboard up? are you on the right app? did you by any chance dismissed the keyboard or is there a modal? You can&#x27;t infer this type of interaction without looking at the screen. Touching on glass gives you no feedback.<p>As an anecdote, I have a galaxy note 4 here as my daily driver. The battery has been replaced but still, it doesn&#x27;t last long. I want my phone to last at least until I get back home, so I decided to change some habits. When I commute to the university, I used spotify to listen to an offline playlist. I decided that listening to music with the smartphone could be replaced with a secondary device. I have a fondness for old minidisc format, so I found my old MD player (a sony mz-r700), recorded my playlists there and started using that while walking. That player has a remote full of buttons, real buttons to control basically all aspects of music playing, from navigation, to volume to anything. With my phone, I would often press play before leaving my building and not interact with it anymore. With the MD player and the remote, I can fiddle with all the controls without ever looking at the player in my pocket or the remote itself. In the end, I use my player features much more than I used the smartphone. I am not only a happier listener but it saves me phone battery.<p>In conclusion, tactic feedback that allows you to do stuff without requiring visual attention removes friction and encourages interaction. As an exercise to those that find this information disagreable, try typing a novel on a Yoga Book without looking at the screen, it is quite hard. Doing the same on a thinkpad is still hard but it is easier than the yoga book option."

comment,14274236,,,1493998893,,meri_dian,"&lt;From Section 1&gt;&quot;A straightforward way of capturing the No-Difference View is total utilitarianism according to which the best outcome is the one in which there would be the greatest quantity of whatever makes life worth living (Parfit 1984 p. 387). However, this view implies that any loss in the quality of lives in a population can be compensated for by a sufficient gain in the quantity of a population&quot;<p>Well yes, but while &#x27;total utility&#x27; may be a relevant measure for a population, populations in the aggregate do not have conscious experience. Therefore &#x27;total utility&#x27; is irrelevant for the individual. It&#x27;s a very poor measure of the &#x27;quality&#x27; of a society.<p>A much better (and more intuitively appealing) measure incorporates &#x27;total utility&#x27; but divides it by population to get average utility. If we take this as our guiding measure then we aren&#x27;t forced to reach The Repugnant Conclusion.<p>But on second thought, this also presents a problem. Because then we could posit a world in which most of the population lives in misery but a small percentage lives wonderful, fulfilling &#x27;maximum utility&#x27; lives. Average utility as I&#x27;ve described it would favor some of these these worlds - given a large enough population - over ones in which there&#x27;s a more even distribution of utility.<p>Therefore let&#x27;s take a page from economics and incorporate a GINI Coefficient measure of utility into our consideration of an ideal world. This should actually eliminate the threat of a Repugnant Conclusion."

comment,14274185,,,1493998441,,tptacek,"The subtlety is in how phishing attacks work. If you initiate a login yourself, unbidden by any outside request, the likelihood of you being phished in that scenario is epsilon. In that situation, the TOTP authenticator on your phone is fine. However, if you&#x27;re logging in as a middle step in a series of steps to get something done (say, answering a request you received via Slack or an email), the likelihood that you could be being phished grows. In those scenarios, the mutual authentication done by the security key helps protect you.<p>The security key is slightly easier to use than the TOTP authenticator and it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll tend to use most of the time. But if you happen to forget it at home or you&#x27;re logging in to check your mail and your security key is halfway across the house but you have your phone handy or something like that, the TOTP backup option is convenient. You also need some kind of backup in case you lose the security key."

Once done (pretty sure it&#x27;d be trivial?) you&#x27;d never have to look at your master reducer again.<p>It&#x27;d all live wherever you like, and be passed on to the master reducer via dispatch.

comment,14274143,,,1493998147,,logfromblammo,"I&#x27;m the only person allowed (by me) to be a hypocrite.<p>The legal doctrines collectively called <i>estoppel</i> ensure this in courts of equity.  You cannot first argue one thing and then later argue a contradictory position.  And in the court of public opinion, you cannot argue that no one has the right to data privacy and then later try to invoke some form of right to data privacy for yourself.<p>Most of the time, that doesn&#x27;t matter.  But when a member of a legislature codifies into law that <i>I</i> don&#x27;t have privacy, I for danged sure am not going to even grant that guy a sliver of a courtesy of a fig leaf of privacy.  I would air his dirty laundry immediately and without hesitation the instant any shred of it landed in my lap.<p>Because rights are a cooperative compact between equals.  They <i>are</i> given as a reward for good behavior, but it is the summation of good behavior across hundreds of millions of individuals.  It doesn&#x27;t matter so much what I <i>believe</i> in relation to a right, but what I <i>do</i>.  If I, for instance, did not believe that owning and carrying sidearms was a right, I probably would just not own or carry one, and the right would not be affected.  If I instead launched a crusade to destroy all pistols, my neighbors would likely be even more unhappy if I did it while carrying for my own protection.<p>You only have those rights you are willing to extend to others.  That is tit-for-tat social strategy writ large."

comment,14274107,,,1493997871,,tuna-piano,"I actually think the author has a good point.<p>When the owner of an iPhone wants a new phone, they overwhelmingly buy an iPhone.  The author makes the point, and I agree, that it is because of the iOS software and not the iPhone hardware.<p>iOS users already have made investments in iOS apps, talk to their friends using iMessage, and are used to the look and feel of the OS.  If these users could buy a Samsung phone with iOS on it, I suspect many would (say for phones with better battery life or other features).<p>So when in China a user spends the vast majority of their time in one app, that app kind of becomes the OS, and there are much lower switching costs between Android and iOS.  Customers in China are in large part just choosing which hardware to run WeChat on.<p>That said, the history in desktop OS tells a less clear story.<p>In 1998, Windows was what almost everyone needed to buy, because they needed to run Windows software.  Overtime the web browser (which works the same across operating systems) became where people spent most of their time, and ChromeOS and Mac were able to gain market share.<p>Apple laptops still have significant market share and pricing power.  But when you compare the Samsung S8 vs iPhone 7, I see much fewer differences than the MacBook vs HP&#x2F;Dell whatever."

comment,14274002,,,1493997162,,dsmithatx,"I&#x27;m a senior lead on a team that had massive turnover and now has all new people.  We support many large and complex web stacks.  As a result the guys on my team don&#x27;t always know how we do things.  Many will agree to commitments they can&#x27;t fill.<p>A 15 minute standup means our team leader and I do not have to wonder what they might be doing or creating.  They say what they are working on and we guide them.  Daily we catch issues where they overly complicating something, or scared to ask for help, or doing any number of crazy things.<p>We are very laid back and don&#x27;t have huge timelines.  If someone doesn&#x27;t show up or have much to say we don&#x27;t even talk about it.  We know they work hard when they do and standup is never about finding out if they are working or not.  In a large enterprise the team leader has meetings all day and can&#x27;t know what is going on when they have 10-15 people under them.  The standup solves that issue.<p>It works great for us and no one has any issues.  I&#x27;d much rather talk about what I work on for a few minutes each day than be micro-managed."

comment,14273963,,,1493996847,,jerf,"&quot;Experiments would take at least several months to run, because it&#x27;s not till several months that you know whether your business is going to fail solely due to the dev team.&quot;<p>If you use the rather stodgy and formulaic scientific method, sure. But if you approach this as a multi-arm bandit problem, and instead look at the question as &quot;how much information do I need to collect with how much statistical power before I am justified in selecting an outcome?&quot;, it becomes quite tractable for a team to just try it out.<p>It also helps if instead of using merely &quot;productivity&quot; as your one and only goal that you also consider team happiness as a real and going concern. Then &quot;Nobody likes it and it&#x27;s demoralizing the engineers&quot; becomes a perfectly valid form of feedback to use in the decision about whether to do it.<p>I also tend to use the metric that the brain is really, really, <i>really</i> good at figuring out what&#x27;s important, sometimes perhaps even too good, so if we start a stand-up meeting plan, and it just sort of peters out, then I let it go. (Seems like somebody wants to try it every 2 or 3 years or so, I generally just let it happen and then evaluate.) Everybody&#x27;s brains are coming to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not important. Rather than fighting it, roll with it. There are some things in life where your rational forebrain must override the deeper instinctive algorithms about what is important, but that&#x27;s quite cognitively expensive, and I&#x27;ve never seen any reason to believe that stand-up meetings are bringing enough value to justify that.<p>I emphasize the &quot;<i>I&#x27;ve</i> never seen any reason&quot;. I hypothesize that in many ways, the work the teams I&#x27;ve been on have been doing is almost maximally pathologically bad for a stand-up meeting. Almost everyone is working on something independent of everybody else, so blockers are only rarely even possible. If your team is, on the other hand, chock-a-block full of blocking potential it may be useful to <i>you</i>.<p>Anyways, there&#x27;s more ways to find out the truth of things that trying to split the universe into two precisely equal parts, make a change in only one of them, and come back ten years later to see what happened, only for someone to complain that a sample size of one isn&#x27;t enough and we really need to do this a thousand more times to have a valid result."

comment,14273894,,,1493996353,,MarkusWinand,"I&#x27;m curios if this is a fair benchmark (considering it was conducted by one of the vendors).<p>So I downloaded the mentioned whitepaper to look at the indexes they created in PostgreSQL.<p>The only thing mentioned in the whitepaper is this table definition:<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t1 (
  &quot;uuid&quot; VARCHAR,
  &quot;ts&quot; TIMESTAMP, &quot;tenant_id&quot; INT4, &quot;sensor_id&quot; VARCHAR,   
  &quot;sensor_type&quot; VARCHAR, &quot;v1&quot; INT4,
  &quot;v2&quot; INT4,
  &quot;v3&quot; FLOAT4,
  &quot;v4&quot; FLOAT4,
  &quot;v5&quot; BOOL,
  &quot;week_generated&quot; TIMESTAMP, &quot;taxonomy&quot; ltree
  );
</code></pre>
The table definition in Crate is a little different:<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS b.t2 ( &quot;uuid&quot; STRING,
  &quot;ts&quot; TIMESTAMP,
  &quot;tenant_id&quot; INTEGER, &quot;sensor_id&quot; STRING, &quot;sensor_type&quot; STRING,
  &quot;v1&quot; INTEGER,
  &quot;v2&quot; INTEGER,
  &quot;v3&quot; FLOAT,
  &quot;v4&quot; FLOAT,
  &quot;v5&quot; BOOLEAN,
  &quot;week_generated&quot; TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS     date_trunc(&#x27;week&#x27;, ts),
   INDEX &quot;taxonomy&quot; USING FULLTEXT (sensor_type) WITH (analyzer=&#x27;tree&#x27;)
  ) PARTITIONED BY (&quot;week_generated&quot;) 
  CLUSTERED BY (&quot;tenant_id&quot;) INTO 3 SHARDS;
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t know anything about how Crate works, but I see PARTITIONED BY (&quot;week_generated&quot;) and 
CLUSTERED BY (&quot;tenant_id&quot;) INTO 3 SHARDS.<p>Now looking at the first query, both, their PARTITION BY as well as CLUSTER BY columns appear in the query:<p><pre><code>  SELECT min(v1) as v1_min, max(v1) as v1_max, avg(v1) as v1_avg, sum(v1) as v1_sum
  FROM b.t2
  WHERE tenant_id = ? AND week_generated BETWEEN ? AND ?;
</code></pre>
Unless there is a sufficiently good index used in PostgreSQL, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a fair benchmark.<p>In the Appendix they mention how the partitioning could be implemented in PostgreSQL, also mention the indexes to be used together with the partitioning, but also say: &quot;Because of this, we abandoned the partitioning approach for our benchmark, instead opting for a single PostgreSQL table with no partition logic.&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t find any statement about if&#x2F;which indexes they were using in PostgreSQL when measuring their benchmarks.<p>They also use a rather old PostgreSQL version (9.2 — released in 2012). Now, we have PostgreSQL 9.6 which has some parallel query execution support that might also change this figures dramatically."

comment,14273858,,,1493996063,,aphextron,"&gt;Try this: close your eyes and tie your shoelaces. No problem at all, right? Now, how well do you think you could tie your shoes if your arm was asleep? Or even if your fingers were numb? When working with our hands, touch does the driving, and vision helps out from the back seat.<p>I think this is an awful analogy. I can type just as fast on my touchscreen no problem without looking. The problem with having physical keyboards on a phone is space. You&#x27;re taking up a solid 1&#x2F;4th of the weight and bulk of a phone with something that is entirely dedicated to the single purpose of entering text. On top of that keyboards are a vector for dust and moisture to enter, making the phone less durable. There&#x27;s a reason iPhone is the single greatest selling electronic device in history, and RIM is circling the drain. People want slim, sexy, lightweight touch phones. Not bricks with keyboards."

(For one, this would work because it <i>does</i> work, <i>right now</i> in Erlang.) But they all came down to that it seems like you&#x27;re missing some of the problems that containerization solves. You can wrap up almost any service -- regardless of language or versions or runtimes or how it interacts with the filesystem or what versions of libraries it depends on or what global configs it expects or anything -- and ship it as a self-contained normalized service that can run right alongside any other number of other self-contained normalized services that require <i>their own</i> global configs and libraries etc etc <i>even if they&#x27;re incompatible</i> and whoever is deploying them doesn&#x27;t even need to care.<p>Everyone has their own language and toolset that they&#x27;re comfortable with and productive in. That will never change. Containerization abstracts over all of them and normalizes their deployment. You can never get that with a solution at the language level."

Unlike the unix world, they can interact with the terminal without sending things to the host, and there&#x27;s support for something sort of like html forms, tab traversal, etc.  They fill out fields and press a send key.  You can&#x27;t, for example, use a normal telnet client.

comment,14273489,,,1493993067,,grandalf,"&gt; &quot;jumping on the bandwagon&quot; is kind of a conversation ender<p>Has there not been a very profound anti-Uber bandwagon effect going on?  Several incidents snowballing into a major backlash?  I think there is some sort of organized labor sponsorship of a smear campaign, fwiw.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think there are overall benefits<p>I&#x27;m curious how you reach this conclusion.  Is it as a consumer, comparing Uber to traditional taxi offerings in your area? Or based on some other viewpoint?<p>&gt;  I am not convinced Uber is some huge innovation<p>I think innovation is the wrong word as well.  Uber is a political and economic achievement of breaking a very entrenched system that had oppressed many people so that a small number could extract profits at the expense of society as as a whole.<p>&gt; democracy and the rule of law are ... important<p>Absolutely. I view corrupt laws and crony capitalism as antithetical to the rule of law even if the laws which happen to be on the books support specific arrangements.  The taxi market was a golden goose being plucked by corrupt officials and a small number of fat cat owners at the expense of <i>everyone</i> else.<p>These sorts of crony&#x2F;entrenched arrangements are a form of organized crime, as are the regulators who enforce unfair laws meant to funnel money into the coffers of specific crony firms.<p>&gt; my version of this being fun is being understood.<p>I <i>think</i> I understand your points. But I&#x27;m not sure how you weigh your various points against each other in terms of their influence on your overall view.  I don&#x27;t disagree with any of them outright, but I think you weigh literal compliance with law too highly.<p>Also, on the subject of Uber&#x27;s corporate culture, Uber has been punished significantly already for the revelations about its culture. As much as I admire Uber&#x27;s accomplishments, I would very likely not want to work there.<p>One time I got a coding quiz easter egg in the Uber app and scored well and was invited to apply, but after what I&#x27;ve heard I would be unlikely to consider it, since I personally view the tolerance of sexual harassment behavior by companies to be one of the biggest indicators of larger culture problems and a &quot;law of the jungle&quot; environment where social dominance trumps merit when it comes to how decisions are made."

comment,14273453,,,1493992805,,georgespencer,"&gt; 30% is a pretty hefty percentage. It&#x27;s the weakest point in the article but imagine if I just cut your salary by 30%, is your job still worthwhile?<p>I&#x27;m unclear how this is a response to my response to OP. OP is saying that Apple forces developers to target the biggest possible audience by taking 30%. I&#x27;m arguing that Apple is agnostic and that if there&#x27;s a way for developers to make more money in a niche then Apple is happy with that. And you can always price your software at +30%.<p>&gt; Except it&#x27;s not the same functionality. Try Evernote for instance ... does it LOOK like the same functionality? That&#x27;s a lot of developer effort you can&#x27;t recoup. You&#x27;ve just diminished all that extra work to support both modalities with a wave of your hand.<p>That&#x27;s a distinction which isn&#x27;t made in the article. Autolayout makes it trivial to support the same functionality across both devices. If you want to introduce new functionality with the iPad then have a separate app. I believe you&#x27;re still entitled to do precisely that.<p>&gt; That thing you paid for 5 years ago no longer exists, the software you bought 5 years ago can&#x27;t even RUN on your new iPhone, what you are getting, for free, is the thing the developer made this year, with actual work, which looks like the thing you bought 5 years ago.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this I&#x27;m afraid. If you&#x27;re discussing the fact that apps sometimes need to be updated to keep running on the new versions of iOS then that&#x27;s just part of the cost of business, but plenty of developers choose to not do this. Again, nobody is forcing developers to do this. Nobody is not buying your app because they think it might not be supported in five years time.<p>&gt; But they do encourage it. It&#x27;s part of the diminishing effect. That you can opt out as a developer doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>It&#x27;s only a diminishing effect on consumers if Apple encourages developers to do it and they do it. There&#x27;s nothing forcing developers to do it. They&#x27;re choosing to. They only have themselves to blame."

It&#x27;s pretty clear that, given the referendum, even Labour would have a hard time voting against Brexit.<p>The weakness is that Brexit is simply 5x worse for the UK than it is for the EU, at least economically. The UK does around 50% of its foreign trade with the EU, while for the EU, which is much larger, this represents only around 10% of trade.<p>The result of failed negotiations is, for the UK, widespread economic depression. For EU countries, it&#x27;s a slight economic road bump. It&#x27;s the same mechanism that makes it a much bigger deal for you to get hired by Google than it does for Google.<p>There&#x27;s no amount of nationalism, tough talk, bluffing, or posturing Britain can do to change the fact that, at the end of the day, Europe can walk away from these negotiations at any time. Indeed, given the wish to clearly show, once and for all, the benefits of EU membership, failure may already be close to break-even. And even bureaucratic monsters have feelings–the Daily Mail may end up creating true European unity as a parting gift.<p>All this was obviously known before the referendum, which is why it&#x27;s baffling to still not even see it being addressed in conservative circles, which instead continue to be rewarded for lying and riling up a nationalistic furore.<p>&gt; The thing is we have a bigger problem<p>Indeed"

comment,14273381,,,1493992101,,matwood,"&gt; When you break things down, you make it easier for less experienced workers to complete work.<p>Actually you make it easier for everyone. The point of breaking down a task is to start removing assumptions, and make it so others can also lend a hand.<p>&gt; However, increased breakdown is very costly on many levels. You need extra time to break things down (senior dev), extra effort to track it in project management tools, extra time to deal with it all every day. It&#x27;s costly.<p>Time and again I have heard this reasoning, but in my experience the real costs comes when <i>not</i> breaking down tasks. There is an unknown unknown problem with large tasks, that is often solved by breaking them down with the stake holder instead of finding the issues during acceptance.<p>I do agree though that the right level to break down tasks is an art that ends up being team specific."

If he doesn&#x27;t know who it is, he asks the manager and he will direct him to the right person. If there is literally no way to proceed, he will work on another issue in the meantime and inform the manager that he&#x27;s blocked on the more important stuff. If there is some way to speed it along together with multiple other people, it will come up when he talks to that first guy. Obviously waiting for the next standup tomorrow is a ridiculous proposition, so standups solve a problem for 1 time of the day requiring by definition more people than should be required because everyone is in it instead of pulling the people in that need to be pulled in for that specific block or feature.<p>I don&#x27;t even know how people defend standups, they usually say something like &quot;hey yeah, I know it&#x27;s mostly useless but it&#x27;s just for 10min a day&quot;.

I&#x27;ve found that what&#x27;s been most effective for me, aside from spending (admittedly, far too much) time coding in the evenings before sleep, is making a concerted effort to share whole-day responsibility of the kids on weekends. I&#x27;ll take the kids on one day, my wife will take the kids on another day. We trade off during the week too so we can both have large stretches of uninterrupted time.<p>Exercise (and for me, meditation) are important balancers too - don&#x27;t neglect them for the sake of coding, you&#x27;ll find that you just get burnt out."
comment,14273213,,,1493990550,,soVeryTired,"It&#x27;s quite possible that you can teach yourself a lot of the relevant background. If you read David Barber&#x27;s book cover to cover and do all the problems, that&#x27;s a machine learning masters&#x27; course covered.<p>But the problem is that you&#x27;re competing against job applicants who already have a degree in machine learning. So it will often be the case that you&#x27;re lucky to make it past an initial HR screen. If they want to interview ten people, life is easier for them to pick ten who already have the right piece of paper."

comment,14273135,,,1493989875,,microtherion,"I transferred into my current job a few years ago, and this year, I interviewed two transfer candidates, one of them (not you, I&#x27;m pretty sure) a QA engineer who wanted to move into an engineering role, so I might have some thoughts on this situation from the other side:<p>What advantages does the candidate expect from being an internal transfer, and what can we fairly offer them? To me, an internal transfer has a sizable advantage in that they are a known quantity in many aspects: You can ask them in much more detail about previous work at the company, you can talk to their co-workers, you have a clearer sense of the projects you were involved in, and in some cases you may already have personally worked with them.<p>Where we DON&#x27;T cut the candidates any slack is the technical side of the job, and QA is usually different work from engineering. So the candidates still stand or fall based on the technical interview.<p>The controversial aspect of Machine Learning jobs in particular, and the situation you described, is credentialism. In many areas of software engineering, credentials are indeed overrated, but Machine Learning IS a very technical field, requiring rather advanced math to truly understand it (rather than just blindly plug together pieces from an ML toolkit), and right now the field is undergoing revolutionary changes, so this is one area where a recent graduate degree really DOES convey a concrete advantage.<p>It should not be an INSURMOUNTABLE advantage, but you&#x27;d have to be a very impressive non-academic candidate. What ML papers have you recently read? How would you plan to apply them in the job you&#x27;re aspiring to? What contributions have you made to the field?"

comment,14272949,,,1493988032,,cwyers,"&gt; P.S. It&#x27;s called ’statistics’.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Read Breiman&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.&quot;<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.math.uu.se&#x2F;~thulin&#x2F;mm&#x2F;breiman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.math.uu.se&#x2F;~thulin&#x2F;mm&#x2F;breiman.pdf</a><p>&quot;Statistics&quot; has largely been concerned with the &quot;data modelling culture&quot; Breiman talks about; a lot of data science is focused on algorithmic modelling, things like neural nets, random forests, and so on. A lot of these techniques have been refined outside of modern statistics because of statistic&#x27;s focus on data modelling.<p>This also ignores all of the things that fall outside of the purview of the modelling steps altogether, things like data cleaning, data engineering, and so on. All of those are properly &quot;data science&quot; but often fall outside of what&#x27;s in a statistics textbook.<p>If you are going to do data science, you should know statistics. You should know a lot of it. But that is far from the only thing you should know.<p>As to your larger point... yeah, well, jobs allow people to eat and get health insurance and all that, so it&#x27;s understandable that OP might want to be able to do those things and not just apply it for his own pleasure. My take on that is that it&#x27;s hard, both to acquire the skills needed and to signal to employers that you have them. If you&#x27;re going that route, you need to build a solid portfolio of work. Kaggle might be a good place to start."

That they recognized the bank as a police credit union instead of recognizing the Star of David as a Jewish symbol doesn&#x27;t meaningfully change the scenario.<p>PCI is not concerned about protecting the user.

There will not be any significant public opposition to this, a few articles in The Guardian and a small mention on the news between Trump stories. I have only experienced apathy when I discuss mass surveillance with people in this country. &quot;I have nothing to hide, why should I care?&quot;. There is a fundamental disconnect between real world privacy and online privacy to most people in this country. At this point it is too late anyway, May has gone full frontal assault on the internet and privacy advocates and security experts don&#x27;t have a hope. I just want her to go full-on now and implement maximum surveillance, maximum snooping and maximum data retention and profiling. All of this can only blow up embarrassingly in her face.

comment,14272700,,,1493985271,,gjm11,"I think there&#x27;s a place for the &quot;# retrieve data&quot; sort of comment. Suppose you&#x27;re <i>skimming</i> rather than reading the code, either trying to get a high-level overview of what it does or looking for the particular bit of it where a particular thing happens. Then, sure, you could just read all the code; but most of us can skim-read a small quantity of text faster than a larger quantity of code. In a syntax-colouring editor it&#x27;s easy to ignore everything but the comments, and if the top-level structure of what&#x27;s happening is sketched in the comments that&#x27;s helpful.<p>How helpful depends, of course, on the style of the code; in particular, it gets less helpful as the length of functions&#x2F;methods goes down, and in the limit of &quot;ravioli code&quot; where everything is decomposed into 3-line methods whose main task is calling other 3-line methods, it doesn&#x27;t help at all and the sort of comment you need to help with skimming is an overview of how the pieces fit together. At the other extreme, if you have the sort of 1000-line function that&#x27;s quite common in e.g. numerical code, these structure-sketching comments can be invaluable."

That is enough to give a manager a <i>pause</i>, but not to immediately dismiss it as a bad idea.<p>Most professionals will agree that it&#x27;s unrealistic to believe that developer-typing-code-time has 100% efficiency. The time spent &#x27;decompressing&#x27;, which can <i>sometimes</i> manifest itself as spending time reading&#x2F;doing unrelated stuff, does sometimes produce a solution faster than just banging away coding.<p>Management work is different from coding in that everything is hard and noisy to measure, so to some extent heuristics are relied upon, simply because it&#x27;s the state of the art in this area.<p>So, even if half an hour meeting with 8 developers takes 4 developer-hours (which is a rather large number), it does not mean those hours are wasted. If one of those meetings a day stops someone spending one week chasing a dead-end known to others at least once in a while, on average the team moves faster, not slower.<p>BTW, I actually agree that 8 developers is too much, and that half an hour is too long for a daily.

The machine was two new teams, one in RPA and one in machine learning.<p>Both proceses ended up taking roughly 3 months, but the &quot;tech&quot; team spent a lot of the time learning how to use the technology and quite a bit training the algorithm.<p>Once the tech team and algorithms were ready, the actual processing time took 5 hours in the Azure cloud.<p>Now we have a process for finding specific documents, however, and I&#x27;m told it&#x27;ll take 1-2 weeks to retrain it, meaning it&#x27;ll be 1-2 weeks + 5 hours vs 3 months next time."

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the main point of the article though, it&#x27;s just trying to show how an inventor of something is not necessarily the person benefiting financially from their invention."
comment,14272508,,,1493982051,,jeltz,"As a Swede I find using us as an example hilarious. We are not a country which has traditionally cared too much about money laundering, most of our anti-money laundering stuff comes from other EU countries via the EU. And we definitely definitely do not have any problems with the tax revenue, our socialist government might even lower corporate taxes next year due to the current stable government income.<p>As for eliminating cash, yes we try to do that, but the reason given is not money laundering. The two reason&#x2F;excuses which are commonly given are 1) preventing tax evasion and 2) preventing store robberies. Also note that the ones most heavily pushing for elimination of cash is not our government but our banks. I think card payments are much more profitable for banks compared to cash. But it is not like our government makes a secret about that its regulations surrounding cash payments are there to prevent tax fraud.<p>And the worst country for when it comes to hunting taxes is probably the US. A couple of days ago I had to sign two forms when opening a bank account where I guaranteed that I had no ties to America. Many smaller European banks wont even accept American citizens as customers due to the extra paper work to report stuff to the American IRS."
comment,14272505,,,1493982012,,audunw,"I think this illustrates one of the catch-22&#x27;s of patents. If you hold the patent, other companies does not have incentive to make and market the invention, making it harder to create market awareness. But if you let go of the patent, unless you have the resources to compete, you&#x27;re unlikely to benefit from your invention. You do have an early mover advantage, but if you don&#x27;t have the means to invest, it doesn&#x27;t help.<p>I think the interface between IP markets and the goods&#x2F;services markets is deeply broken.<p>The core of the problem is that we have to create artificial scarcity to balance the IP economy against the &quot;real&quot; economy. For example: in theory, you could have access to every movie ever created for free. It doesn&#x27;t cost anything to make a copy. This is unlike things like bread or haircuts, where having an infinite supply is a physical impossibility. But the people making the movies have to pay for bread and haircuts, so you have to pay them something. And to get you to pay for it, you have to balance your desire to watch movies against your need to buy bread and haircuts.<p>Previously we achieved this only through artificial scarcity. Now, with Spotify, you have another model which is: someone decides that everyone should pay $50-$99 a month for music, and then you have access to all the music. The problem is that this is a pretty inelastic market. It&#x27;s hard to create competing services with different prices. It&#x27;s also undemocratic. And the default is still artificial scarcity.<p>You could imagine an IP tax. Through a democratic process, we decide that X% of our incomes should be spent on developing IP. All IP is free, but you have IP credits that you spend on the IPs that have value for you, in whatever ratio you want. The number of credits the inventor&#x2F;designer&#x2F;creator receives in a month is then used to fairly divide the fund generated from the IP tax. IP developers also have to pay IP tax, and receive IP credits, so it would be natural for them to forward credits to the IP they depend upon. Since you can&#x27;t spend the IP credits on yourself, you have no incentive to not support the IPs that you benefited from.<p>This solutions is just a thought experiment. It might not be feasible, and it&#x27;s a government-based solution. I&#x27;m not ideologically opposed to government solutions, but it is inelegant. The point is just to think about how we could interface the IP markets with the &quot;real&quot; markets in a more efficient way. There must be better solutions than what we have today.<p>Another option may be to introduce basic income, have everything be free, and just rely on donations, crowdfunding and merchandise for extra funding. Patreon seems to show that people are actually willing to simply give money to the things they like, as long as they get credit."

If your task is implementing analytics and no one else on the team has anything much to do with it, then maybe it&#x27;s best not to trouble them with the specifics.  Your summary is much better, and only a few extra words, but if no one really cares about the analytics except to know that it&#x27;s cheerfully in progress, maybe it&#x27;s not all that necessary to go into more detail. This is definitely something you need to be wary of in a multi-disciplinary team.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t mean &quot;Anyone can come over and ask me about analytics if they like!&quot; to sound defensive - it was actually more tongue-in-cheek!  Here&#x27;s another attempt: &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine why you would want to bore yourself with my analytics implementation, but please come over and ask me about it if you&#x27;re having trouble sleeping at night.&quot;  (I will freely admit that I am a confident person and would have no trouble saying something like that in front of a dozen people.)"
